    <node id="Mr. Rochester left his game with Miss Ingram and followed the narrator, Jane Eyre, because of the urgent errand she presented. Although he made a &quot;curious grimace&quot; and seemed reluctant to be disturbed, his sense of duty as master of Thornfield Hall led him to attend to Jane's request. The text also suggests that Jane's demeanor and tone of voice may have contributed to his decision; she spoke in a low voice and with a certain level of determination, causing Miss Ingram to make a movement &quot;as if tempted to order me away.&quot; Ultimately, Mr. Rochester prioritized Jane's needs over his own leisure activities, showcasing a sense of responsibility towards her." />
    <node id=", and their&#10;admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to&#10;disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not&#10;defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.&#10;She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to&#10;demand, &quot;What can the creeping creature want now?&quot; and when I said, in a&#10;low voice, &quot;Mr. Rochester,&quot; she made a movement as if tempted to order me&#10;away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and&#10;very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure&#10;scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,&#10;and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty&#10;lineaments.&#10;&#10;&quot;Does that person want you?&quot; she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.&#10;Rochester turned to see who the &quot;person&quot; was.  He made a curious&#10;grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his&#10;cue and followed me from the room" />
    <node id=" like to take you back with me early to-morrow&#10;morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:&#10;but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; and I will do it now;&quot; and having directed him to the servants'&#10;hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions&#10;of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the&#10;stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:&#10;she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-&#10;room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded&#10;thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their&#10;admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to&#10;disturb so interesting a party; my err" />
    <node id=" her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of&#10;running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead&#10;before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very&#10;different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How long will you stay?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As short a time as possible, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Promise me only to stay a week--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any&#10;pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, she has sent her coachman.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A person to be trusted?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;" />
    <node id=" it.

Teach me; I'm&#10;not quite up to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then say it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What must I say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The same, if you like, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like&#10;something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you&#10;had no relations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me&#10;off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was&#10;talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the&#10;veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of&#10;the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago&#10;in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his&#10;family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked&#10;his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of&#10;running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Early to-morrow morning, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I&#10;daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have&#10;you in the world, Jane?&quot; he asked, smiling.&#10;&#10;I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  &quot;Five shillings, sir.&quot;  He&#10;took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as&#10;if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: &quot;Here,&quot;&#10;said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but&#10;fifteen.  I told him I had no change.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages.&quot;&#10;&#10;I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as&#10;if recollecting something, he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Right, right!  Better not give you" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Mr. Rochester asks Jane Eyre if she has any relations who could help her find a new situation or employment, to which she responds:&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot tell, sir; I have never sought for help of that kind in my life: I don't know where to apply.&quot;&#10;&#10;Jane's response indicates that she has not relied on her relatives for assistance in the past. She seems to be self-reliant and has not reached out to her family members for support, perhaps due to estrangement or a desire to manage her own affairs. The text also suggests that Jane may feel uncomfortable or unsure about approaching her relatives for help, as she mentions not knowing where to apply. This further highlights Jane's independent nature and her determination to navigate her life without relying on others, even if it means facing challenges on her own." />
    <node id=" by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.&#10;Neither of us had dropt a tear.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=".  He made a curious&#10;grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his&#10;cue and followed me from the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane?&quot; he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,&#10;which he had shut.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What to do?--where to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To see a sick lady who has sent for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What sick lady?--where does she live?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At Gateshead; in ---shire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for&#10;people to see her that distance?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is his widow, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what have you to do with her?

    <node id=" never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time&#10;in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and&#10;wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an&#10;invitation up to town.  &quot;It would be so much better,&quot; she said, &quot;if she&#10;could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.&quot;  I&#10;did not ask what she meant by &quot;all being over,&quot; but I suppose she&#10;referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of&#10;funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's&#10;indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had&#10;been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and&#10;unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never" />
    <node id="Miss Vernon, a character from Jane Eyre, is primarily focused on herself and her own concerns, as evidenced by the fact that she never brings up her mother's illness or her family's difficult situation in their conversations with Jane. Instead, she talks at length about her past gaiety and her aspirations for future dissipation.&#10;&#10;Despite her many activities, it is unclear exactly what Miss Vernon does with her time each day. Robert, the coachman, mentions that she has an alarm to wake her up early and that she seems constantly busy, but the specifics of her work or duties are not provided. It is also noted that she only spends about five minutes per day in her mother's sickroom.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Vernon appears to be more interested in maintaining her own routine and pursuing her own pleasures than in addressing the serious challenges facing her family." />
    <node id="attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints&#10;were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and&#10;sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of&#10;fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The&#10;communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same&#10;theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once&#10;adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the&#10;present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly&#10;taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after&#10;dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her&#10;mother's sick-room, and no more.&#10;&#10;Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw&#10;a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what&#10;she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an&#10;alarm to call her up early.

    <node id="poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She&#10;was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather&#10;better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making&#10;signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,&#10;that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she&#10;made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to&#10;her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means&#10;anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and&#10;advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but&#10;their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,&#10;that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can&#10;get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow&#10;morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and&#10;child are thriving.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And are the family well at the house, Robert?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very&#10;badly at present--in great trouble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope no one is dead,&quot; I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too&#10;looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how does his mother bear it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been&#10;very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and&#10;his death was shocking.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst" />
    <node id=" no conversation.  I believe&#10;she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing&#10;annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to&#10;vary its clockwork regularity.&#10;&#10;She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than&#10;usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had&#10;been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,&#10;settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had&#10;taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly&#10;improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or&#10;linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a&#10;retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from&#10;disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous&#10;world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, El" />
    <node id="Mr. Reed is the brother of the speaker (who is Jane Eyre's mother) and husband to Mrs. Reed, who is Jane's aunt. Mrs. Reed cast off the speaker because she was poor and burdensome, and Mrs. Reed disliked her. This suggests that there was a falling out or estrangement between the two sisters-in-law, possibly due to social or economic differences.&#10;&#10;As for their children, John Reed has died, supposedly from suicide due to ruining himself and his family financially. The news of his death also caused his mother to have an apoplectic attack. Georgiana Reed, their daughter, is mentioned as having been much admired for her beauty in London a season or two ago.&#10;&#10;The speaker (Jane's aunt) mentions that Jane's cousins, John and Georgiana, would not be of any help to her because they are likely estranged from Jane, just like their mother. This further highlights the tension and distance between Jane and her paternal relatives." />
    <node id=" said she; &quot;don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are&#10;you Jane Eyre?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such&#10;a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,&#10;daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden&#10;starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's&#10;movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a&#10;fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her&#10;away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever&#10;broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:&#10;but I said she did--I wish she had died!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only&#10;sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning&#10;her when she made her low marriage" />
    <node id="The very tall and thin young lady with a sallow face, severe mien, and ascetic look is Eliza Reed. She has changed significantly from the person Jane Eyre knew before. Eliza now dresses in a plain and severe manner, which enhances her ascetic appearance. This is a departure from how she used to be, as Jane remembers Eliza as a lively and cheerful child. Despite their shared lineage, Jane finds it difficult to recognize Eliza due to these changes. The only trait that reminds Jane of Eliza's mother is her Cairngorm eye." />
    <node id=" through the hall; &quot;the young ladies will be there.&quot;&#10;&#10;In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article&#10;of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced&#10;to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the&#10;hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two&#10;volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third&#10;shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.&#10;The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered&#10;past recognition.&#10;&#10;Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as&#10;Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There&#10;was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme&#10;plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen&#10;collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a&#10;string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though&#10;I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that" />
    <node id="&#10;string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though&#10;I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and&#10;colourless visage.&#10;&#10;The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I&#10;remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a&#10;full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular&#10;features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of&#10;her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her&#10;sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the&#10;other's looked puritanical.&#10;&#10;In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;&#10;the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the&#10;blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and&#10;chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable&#10;hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.&#10;&#10;Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Who--I?&quot; was her answer.  &quot;Who are you?&quot; looking at me with surprise and&#10;a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  &quot;You are quite a stranger to&#10;me--where is Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is at the lodge, aunt.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aunt,&quot; she repeated.  &quot;Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the&#10;Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are&#10;quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!&quot;&#10;&#10;I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my&#10;identity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet,&quot; said she, &quot;I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I&#10;wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:&#10;besides, in eight years she must be so changed.&quot;  I now gently assured&#10;her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing&#10;that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I&#10;explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield" />
    <node id="Jane Eyre's surprising reaction towards her aunt Reed is one of forgiveness, compassion, and a desire to reconcile. Despite the bitter feelings and resentment she had for her aunt due to past mistreatment, Jane approaches Mrs. Reed with kindness and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries. This change in attitude can be attributed to Jane's growth and maturity over the years, as well as her desire to let go of past grievances and seek peace.&#10;&#10;During their encounter, Jane shows no signs of anger or resentment, even when reminded of the &quot;childhood's terrors and sorrows&quot; associated with Mrs. Reed. Instead, she stoopes down and kisses her aunt, expressing concern for her well-being. Jane's surprising reaction showcases her strong character, emotional intelligence, and ability to empathize with others, even those who have wronged her in the past. This moment also underscores Jane's determination to move forward in her life with a positive outlook and a willingness to forgive, which sets her apart from her bitter and resentful aunt Reed." />
    <node id=" of vengeance&#10;and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in&#10;bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion&#10;than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to&#10;forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in&#10;amity.&#10;&#10;The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that&#10;peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,&#10;imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and&#10;hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived&#10;as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:&#10;she looked at me.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is this Jane Eyre?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?&quot;&#10;&#10;I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no&#10;sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her&#10;hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should&#10;at that moment" />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide direct information about John Eyre refusing to help Jane prosper in the past. However, it is mentioned that Jane has never sought help from her relatives before, and she herself states that she &quot;doesn't know where to apply&quot; when Mr. Rochester asks if she has any relations who could assist her.&#10;&#10;Based on the provided narrative, John Eyre's absence in Jane's life may be due to the falling out between Mrs. Reed (Jane's aunt and John Eyre's sister) and Jane's mother. The tension between the two sisters-in-law could have led to estrangement between their families, including John Eyre. There is no mention of any direct interaction or conflict between Jane and John Eyre that would have caused him to refuse helping her specifically.&#10;&#10;It is possible that John Eyre was unaware of Jane's situation or did not know the extent of her needs. Additionally, his absence might be due to social or economic differences between Jane and the Reed family, as well as Jane's connections with the poorer side of the family through her mother.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is no explicit mention of John Eyre refusing to help Jane prosper in the past due to resentment towards her, there are various factors such as family tension, social and economic differences, and possible lack of communication that could have contributed to their estrangement." />
    <node id="During a period of more than ten days, Mrs. Reed's health was unstable, and she was either delirious or lethargic due to her illness. The doctor believed that she might not recover fully. Mrs. Reed also expressed concerns about money and her financial troubles. She repeatedly threatened Jane with death, mentioning disturbing dreams where she saw Mr. Reed dead with a great wound in his throat or a swollen and blackened face. However, after more than ten days, Jane returned to Gateshead and found out from Bessie that Mrs. Reed was more sensible and collected but still gravely ill. The doctor thought she might linger for a week or two, but her full recovery seemed unlikely. During this period, Mrs. Reed also expressed her long-standing dislike for Jane's mother and mentioned that she had been talking about Jane before falling asleep again." />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;She was getting much excited.  &quot;I think I had better leave her now,&quot; said&#10;I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in&#10;the morning she is calmer.&quot;&#10;&#10;I rose.  &quot;Stop!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Reed, &quot;there is another thing I wished to&#10;say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or&#10;mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in&#10;his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange&#10;pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be&#10;had?&quot;&#10;&#10;Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she&#10;succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and&#10;sank into a dozing state.

Three times a day, she studied a Common Prayer Book, dedicating three hours to stitching with gold thread on a square crimson cloth, two hours to working alone in the kitchen-garden, one hour to regulating her accounts, and an unspecified amount of time to maintaining her diary.

I know not how she occupied herself before&#10;breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular&#10;portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she&#10;studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer&#10;Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and&#10;she said, &quot;the Rubric.&quot;  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold&#10;thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a&#10;carpet.

He is now married to Bessie, the former nursemaid of Jane and her cousins. Leaven mentioned that his wife had recently given birth to their third child, and he came to ask Jane for a leave of absence so she could visit Mrs. Reed, who was a widow of Mr. Reed, a magistrate from Gateshead.

On repairing thither, I&#10;found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's&#10;servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand&#10;was surrounded with a crape band.&#10;&#10;&quot;I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,&quot; he said, rising as I entered;&#10;&quot;but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at&#10;Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Robert! how do you do?

I&#10;had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay&#10;with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or&#10;folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.

    <node id="Georgiana and Eliza Reed display different emotional responses to the news about Lord Edwin Vere, which reveals their characters and values. Georgiana's reaction is one of intense sadness and regret, as expressed through her tears and inability to face her aunt's corpse. This reflects her sensitive and emotional nature, consistent with her past admiration and conquest in London society.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Eliza shows a complete lack of emotion and detachment from the situation. She calmly observes her aunt's body, offers a brief comment about her constitution, and then quickly leaves the room after a spasm constricts her mouth. This demonstrates Eliza's ascetic and unemotional personality, which has been shaped by her rigid religious beliefs and plain lifestyle.&#10;&#10;The wet and windy weather further highlights the contrasting attitudes of Georgiana and Eliza. While Georgiana is absorbed in her saint's-day service at the new church, Eliza remains steadfast in her devotional duties, regardless of the unfavorable weather. This suggests that Eliza is more resolute and unwavering in her religious beliefs and actions than her sister.&#10;&#10;In summary, Georgiana and Eliza Reed's differing emotional states reveal their contrasting characters and values. Georgiana's sensitive and emotional nature is shown through her tears and regret for Lord Edwin Vere, while Eliza's ascetic and unemotional personality is displayed through her calm detachment and rigid adherence to her religious duties.

Feeling without judgment is a washy&#10;draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and&#10;husky a morsel for human deglutition.&#10;&#10;It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa&#10;over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day&#10;service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul," />

Of course, I lied: it was, in&#10;fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that&#10;to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The&#10;other drawings pleased her much, but she called that &quot;an ugly man.&quot; They&#10;both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;&#10;and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her&#10;album.

Before we&#10;had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she&#10;had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent&#10;in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the&#10;attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.

Eliza and I went to look&#10;at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared&#10;not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,&#10;rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow&#10;and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange&#10;and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and&#10;pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or&#10;subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_&#10;loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a&#10;form.&#10;&#10;Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she&#10;observed--&#10;&#10;&quot;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life&#10;was shortened by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so" />

Georgiana added to her &quot;How&#10;d'ye do?&quot; several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,&#10;uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances&#10;that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab&#10;merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage&#10;bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they&#10;think you a &quot;quiz&quot; without actually saying the words.  A certain&#10;superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,&#10;express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or" />
    <node id="Jane Eyre is motivated by a sense of compassion, forgiveness, and a desire to reconcile with her past. Despite the mistreatment she experienced from Mrs. Reed and her bitter feelings towards her, Jane approaches her aunt with kindness and a strong urge to forgive all injuries. This change in attitude can be attributed to Jane's growth and maturity over the years, as well as her determination to move forward in her life with a positive outlook and a willingness to let go of past grievances.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Jane's independent nature and strong character play a role in her decision to stay at Gateshead. She is self-reliant and has not relied on her relatives for assistance in the past. However, she also recognizes that this may be an opportunity to provide care and support to her aunt during her time of need, despite the strained relationship between them. Jane's emotional intelligence and ability to empathize with others, even those who have wronged her, are showcased in this moment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's encounter with her cousins Eliza and Georgiana, as well as hearing about the fate of their brother John Reed, may also influence her decision to stay at Gateshead. Seeing the consequences of their family's pride and folly, as well as recognizing the difficulty of reconnecting with estranged relatives, may motivate Jane to provide care and support for her aunt while she still can.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane Eyre's decision to stay at Gateshead is motivated by a combination of factors, including her compassion and forgiveness towards her aunt, her strong character and independence, and her recognition of the complexities of family relationships and estrangement." />
    <node id="The subject of the portrait that the narrator was drawing is Mr. Rochester. During Georgiana's winter in London, she spent a brilliant time there, receiving admiration and attention from many people. She even made a titled conquest, suggesting that she had a romantic liaison with someone of high social standing. However, the text does not provide more specific details about her experiences." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.&#10;She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade&#10;everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well&#10;as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at&#10;first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and&#10;scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would&#10;chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of&#10;me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or&#10;amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me&#10;for both.&#10;&#10;Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take&#10;a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching&#10;fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to&#10;shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse&#10;of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;&#10;a group" />
    <node id="The description refers to the creation of a portrait of Mr. Rochester, who is the subject of the narrator's sketching. The author used their imagination and a soft black pencil to draw a face with a broad and prominent forehead, square lower outline, strong horizontal eyebrows, well-defined nose, flexible-looking mouth, firm chin with a cleft, and possibly some black whiskers. However, in the narrative, the author claims to have shown Georgiana and Eliza Reed a different drawing, calling Mr. Rochester's portrait &quot;an ugly man&quot; and hiding it beneath other sheets." />

I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad&#10;point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and&#10;prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour&#10;gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.&#10;Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then&#10;followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full&#10;nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm&#10;chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black&#10;whiskers" />

Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,&#10;because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I&#10;shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids&#10;lustrous and large.  &quot;Good! but not quite the thing,&quot; I thought, as I&#10;surveyed the effect: &quot;they want more force and spirit;&quot; and I wrought the&#10;shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy&#10;touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my&#10;gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs&#10;on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed&#10;and content.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;" />
    <node id="After Mr. Rochester leaves, Jane prepares for her journey to Gateshead to visit Mrs. Reed, who is sick. She mentions that she will be leaving early the next day and has already informed Mrs. Fairfax about her departure. Jane has stated that she will not come down to the drawing-room after dinner, as she needs to prepare for her trip. The text does not explicitly mention where Jane returns to after her encounter with Mr. Rochester at the door, but it can be inferred that she goes back to her own room or the schoolroom to continue her preparations for the journey." />

Bessie was faithful; but she had her own&#10;family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found&#10;the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the&#10;patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the&#10;pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,&#10;re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on&#10;me, and then I moved away to the window.&#10;&#10;The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:&#10;&quot;One lies there,&quot; I thought" />

Additionally, Mrs. Reed mentions that Eliza still speaks little, has an alarm to call her up early, and is always diligent, but it is difficult to say what she does or what the result of her diligence is.

    <node id="The two individuals that the narrator, Jane Eyre, encounters are Eliza Reed and Leaven (the married coachman). Eliza Reed has changed significantly from the lively and cheerful child Jane remembers. She is now a very tall and thin young lady with a sallow face, severe mien, ascetic look, and plain dress. These changes make it difficult for Jane to recognize her cousin. On the other hand, Leaven appears to be much the same as when he worked at Gateshead eight or nine years ago, but now he is married to Bessie, the former nursemaid of Jane and her cousins. The difference lies in his familial situation, as he has recently become a father for the third time and requests leave to visit Mrs. Reed, who is Jane's aunt and Leaven's former employer." />
    <node id="Mrs. Reed, the aunt of the speaker (Jane Eyre's mother) and Jane's guardian, took revenge against Jane by falsely claiming that Jane had died of typhus fever at Lowood. She did this to prevent Jane from being adopted by her uncle and placed in a state of ease and comfort. Mrs. Reed justifies this act by stating that she could not endure the thought of Jane being in a better situation than her own children, as it would have been a source of torment for her. This revelation highlights the long-standing animosity between Mrs. Reed and Jane's family, leading to Mrs. Reed's vengeful actions against Jane." />
    <node id="Dear Mrs. Reed,&quot; said I, as I offered her the draught she required,&#10;&quot;think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me&#10;for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have&#10;passed since that day.&quot;&#10;&#10;She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and&#10;drawn breath, she went on thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be&#10;adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was&#10;what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his&#10;disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at&#10;Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose&#10;my falsehood as soon as you like.

    <node id="According to Eliza's perspective, Georgiana is depicted as a vain and absurd individual who spends most of her time lounging around and complaining about the dullness of their surroundings. Eliza criticizes her sister's behavior, viewing it as self-indulgent and frivolous, in contrast to her own focus on religious devotion and accountability. Despite this criticism, Eliza still takes notice of Georgiana's actions, rebuking her with a sarcastic remark about her vanity when she becomes too absorbed in admiring herself in the mirror. Overall, Eliza sees her sister as someone who is overly concerned with superficial matters and lacking in seriousness or purpose." />

The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the&#10;last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than&#10;any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and&#10;exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or&#10;bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.&#10;&#10;&quot;How is Mrs. Reed?&quot; I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who&#10;thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected&#10;liberty.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you&#10;can see her to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that the repeated dreams of an infant and being startled by a mysterious cry on a moonlit night were related to Jane's anxiety and nervousness about visiting Mrs. Reed, who was on her deathbed. The baby-phantom that Jane kept seeing in her dreams may have symbolized her own vulnerability and fear of the unknown, while the crying sound she heard on the moonlit night could have been a manifestation of her inner turmoil and apprehension. It is also possible that these occurrences were subconscious reflections of Jane's unresolved feelings towards Mrs. Reed and her family, particularly her desire to confront them about their past mistreatment and seek closure." />

The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her&#10;little sister.&#10;&#10;Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during&#10;the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not&#10;brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my&#10;arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with&#10;daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was&#10;a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled&#10;close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition&#10;evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive&#10;nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.&#10;&#10;I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one&#10;image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the&#10;vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had&#10;been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are&#10;signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not&#10;yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because&#10;I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for&#10;instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives&#10;asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to&#10;which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.&#10;And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with&#10;man.&#10;&#10;When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie&#10;Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little&#10;child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either&#10;to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,&#10;had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix&#10;it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her&#10;little sister.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I&#10;explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am very ill, I know,&quot; she said ere long.  &quot;I was trying to turn myself&#10;a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I&#10;should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,&#10;burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?&#10;or is there no one in the room but you?&quot;&#10;&#10;I assured her we were alone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in&#10;breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own&#10;child; the other--&quot; she stopped.  &quot;After all, it is of no great&#10;importance, perhaps,&quot; she murmured to herself: &quot;and then I may get&#10;better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.&quot;&#10;&#10;She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;&#10;she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor," />
    <node id="On her deathbed, Mrs. Reed regrets the wrongs she had committed against Jane Eyre, specifically falsely claiming that Jane had died of typhus fever at Lowood to prevent Jane from being adopted by her uncle and placed in a state of ease and comfort. She also regrets causing Jane distress and hardship throughout her childhood. However, Mrs. Reed finds it difficult to confess this wrongdoing to Jane directly because of their long-standing animosity, as well as her own pride and resistance to acknowledging Jane's goodness. Instead, she chooses to write a letter to Jane expressing her regrets, but even in the letter, she fails to explicitly mention her vengeful actions against Jane." />

But unimpressionable&#10;natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily&#10;eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather&#10;from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so&#10;icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was&#10;unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to&#10;tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me&#10;bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous&#10;pleasure: only a sense of mortification.&#10;&#10;I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to&#10;subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.&#10;My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their&#10;source.

    <node id="Robert Leaven is a man who used to work as a coachman for the Reed family when Jane Eyre lived at Gateshead eight or nine years ago. He has now married Bessie, the former nursemaid of Jane and her cousins. He appears at Thornfield Hall, where Jane now resides, to request a leave of absence so he can visit Mrs. Reed, who is Jane's aunt and his former employer.&#10;&#10;The news that Robert Leaven brings about his family includes the following:&#10;&#10;1. Mr. Reed, Jane's uncle and Robert's former master, has passed away.&#10;2. Mrs. Reed, the widow of Mr. Reed, has cast off Jane because she was poor, burdensome, and disliked by her.&#10;3. John Reed, Jane's cousin, is also deceased. He reportedly ruined himself and his family, is suspected to have committed suicide, and his death brought on an apoplectic attack that led to Mrs. Reed's own illness.&#10;4. Robert Leaven's wife, Bessie, has given birth to their third child recently." />
    <node id="Jane Eyre plans to travel to Gateshead to visit her sick aunt, Mrs. Reed. She intends to leave early the next day after obtaining leave of absence for a week or two from Mr. Rochester. Jane will be accompanied by Mrs. Reed's coachman, who has been with the family for ten years and is considered trustworthy. Although Mr. Rochester inquired about her plans, Jane does not explicitly state how long she intends to stay, likely because she cannot predict the duration of her aunt's illness or any other unforeseen circumstances that may arise during her visit." />
    <node id="The passage does not directly mention Miss Temple's maid, Bessie. However, based on the supporting materials provided, Bessie is now married to Robert Leaven and they have three children together. On this particular occasion, Jane Eyre has returned to Gateshead Hall after many years to visit her sick aunt, Mrs. Reed. As Jane looks around the familiar surroundings, she reflects on how much she has changed since leaving Gateshead – she now feels like a &quot;wanderer&quot; with &quot;firmer trust in herself and her own powers.&quot; Bessie then directs Jane to enter the breakfast-room to join the &quot;young ladies,&quot; which would be Eliza Reed and potentially other family members or guests present in the house at the time." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Georgiana and Eliza Reed display different emotional responses to the news about Lord Edwin Vere's downfall. Georgiana is intensely sad and regretful, crying and unable to face her aunt's corpse, while Eliza remains calmly detached and offers a brief comment before leaving the room. This reflects Georgiana's sensitive and emotional nature, which is consistent with her past admiration in London society, and Eliza's ascetic and unemotional personality shaped by her rigid religious beliefs. The wet and windy weather highlights their contrasting attitudes, with Georgiana absorbed in a saint's-day service at the new church and Eliza steadfast in her devotional duties.&#10;&#10;Regarding Lord Edwin Vere's downfall, Georgiana is deeply affected, expressing intense sadness and regret, which suggests that she had strong emotions towards him or held him in high regard. In contrast, Eliza shows no emotion or concern, reflecting her lack of investment in external matters outside of her religious duties.&#10;&#10;The passage also highlights the values and personalities of Georgiana and Eliza, with Georgiana's emotional nature standing in stark contrast to Eliza's asceticism and detachment. The weather serves as a metaphor for their differing attitudes, with Georgiana being more sensitive to external factors while Eliza remains steadfast and unwavering in her religious devotion." />
    <node id="Miss Ingram's statement about leaving Jane Eyre alone on Earth, even if they were the last two humans remaining, is a metaphor that conveys the intensity of her dislike or disregard for Jane. By implying that she would prefer to be alone than in the company of Jane, Miss Ingram expresses her deep-seated animosity towards Jane Eyre. This sentiment may stem from various factors such as jealousy over Mr. Rochester's attention towards Jane, social class differences, or simply a clash of personalities. Regardless of the reason, Miss Ingram's statement highlights the stark contrast between her and Jane's standing in society, as well as their interpersonal relationships at Thornfield Hall." />
    <node id="Mrs. Reed's health condition is critical; she has been ill for over ten days, experiencing delirious and lethargic states. The doctor believes she may not recover fully and thinks she might linger for a week or two before passing away. Despite her illness, there have been moments where Mrs. Reed was more sensible and collected. During her bouts of coherency, Mrs. Reed has mentioned the narrator (Jane), expressing a wish for Jane to come to Gateshead. However, when Jane visits, Mrs. Reed is in a stupor and doesn't regain consciousness, passing away later that night without responding to Jane's offer of forgiveness or request for divine forgiveness." />

Three times a day, she studied a Common Prayer Book, dedicating three hours to stitching with gold thread on a square crimson cloth, two hours to working alone in the kitchen-garden, one hour to regulating her accounts, and an unspecified amount of time to maintaining her diary. The square crimson cloth she was decorating with gold thread was significant because it was a covering for the altar of a new church recently erected near Gateshead. This task reflected her religious devotion and dedication to contributing to her community.">

The doctor believes she may not recover fully and thinks she might linger for a week or two before passing away. Despite her illness, there have been moments where Mrs. Reed was more sensible and collected. During her bouts of coherency, Mrs. Reed has mentioned the narrator (Jane), expressing a wish for Jane to come to Gateshead. However, when Jane visits, Mrs. Reed is in a stupor and doesn't regain consciousness, passing away later that night without responding to Jane's offer of forgiveness or request for divine forgiveness.">

Jane's surprising reaction showcases her strong character, emotional intelligence, and ability to empathize with others, even those who have wronged her in the past. This moment also underscores Jane's determination to move forward in her life with a positive outlook and a willingness to forgive, which sets her apart from her bitter and resentful aunt Reed.">

However, she has decided to exclude her daughter Eliza from these plans because Eliza seems too busy with her own concerns and shows little interest in her mother's wishes. Additionally, Mrs. Reed mentions that Eliza still speaks little, has an alarm to call her up early, and is always diligent, but it is difficult to say what she does or what the result of her diligence is. It can be inferred that Mrs. Reed sees Jane as a better candidate for adoption due to Eliza's apparent lack of interest in their family relationship.">

Eliza Reed has changed significantly from the lively and cheerful child Jane remembers. She is now a very tall and thin young lady with a sallow face, severe mien, ascetic look, and plain dress. These changes make it difficult for Jane to recognize her cousin. On the other hand, Leaven appears to be much the same as when he worked at Gateshead eight or nine years ago, but now he is married to Bessie, the former nursemaid of Jane and her cousins. The difference lies in his familial situation, as he has recently become a father for the third time and requests leave to visit Mrs. Reed, who is Jane's aunt and Leaven's former employer.">

Eliza criticizes her sister's behavior, viewing it as self-indulgent and frivolous, in contrast to her own focus on religious devotion and accountability. Despite this criticism, Eliza still takes notice of Georgiana's actions, rebuking her with a sarcastic remark about her vanity when she becomes too absorbed in admiring herself in the mirror. Overall, Eliza sees her sister as someone who is overly concerned with superficial matters and lacking in seriousness or purpose." target="Based on the narrative provided, Georgiana and Eliza Reed display different emotional responses to the news about Lord Edwin Vere's downfall. Georgiana is intensely sad and regretful, crying and unable to face her aunt's corpse, while Eliza remains calmly detached and offers a brief comment before leaving the room. This reflects Georgiana's sensitive and emotional nature, which is consistent with her past admiration in London society, and Eliza's ascetic and unemotional personality shaped by her rigid religious beliefs. The wet and windy weather highlights their contrasting attitudes, with Georgiana absorbed in a saint's-day service at the new church and Eliza steadfast in her devotional duties.&#10;&#10;Regarding Lord Edwin Vere's downfall, Georgiana is deeply affected, expressing intense sadness and regret, which suggests that she had strong emotions towards him or held him in high regard.

The weather serves as a metaphor for their differing attitudes, with Georgiana being more sensitive to external factors while Eliza remains steadfast and unwavering in her religious devotion.">

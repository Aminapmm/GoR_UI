    <node id=" The speaker, Mr. Rochester, justified seeking pleasure and the potential for degeneration by arguing that happiness is denied to him, so he has a right to seek pleasure in life regardless of the cost. He believes that this pleasure can be as sweet and fresh as wild honey, despite the warning from another character that it will sting and taste bitter. Mr. Rochester challenges this assertion, claiming that the other character has no way of knowing whether it will be bitter or not, as they have never tried it. He further justifies his actions by stating that he has a right to not be burdened and hampered by his circumstances, and that he may be able to reform in the future if necessary." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I&#10;have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,&#10;hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is&#10;irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I&#10;_will_ get it, cost what it may.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you will degenerate still more, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I&#10;may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the&#10;moor.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn&#10;you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head&quot;&#10;(taking one from the mantelpiece).  &quot;You have no right to preach to me,&#10;you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely&#10;unacquainted with its mysteries.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I only remind you" />
    <node id="you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely&#10;unacquainted with its mysteries.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought&#10;remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered&#10;across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather&#10;than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here&#10;it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on&#10;the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest&#10;when it asks entrance to my heart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to&#10;distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the&#10;eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the&#10;suggestion had returned upon you." />

Do you wonder that I avow this to you?&#10;Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself&#10;elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people&#10;will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to&#10;tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they&#10;will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their&#10;indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting&#10;and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know?--how can you guess all" />

I ought to have replied that&#10;it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about&#10;appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little&#10;consequence, or something of that sort.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,&#10;indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of&#10;stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under&#10;my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have&#10;all my limbs and all my features like any other man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed&#10;repartee: it was only a blunder.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.

Now, when any vicious simpleton excites&#10;my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am&#10;better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.

    <node id=" Yes, the speaker, Mr. Rochester, is inquiring about the possibility of being transformed back to flesh from his current state, which he describes as hard and tough as an India-rubber ball.

Already it has done me good: my&#10;heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the&#10;conversation, because it has got out of my depth.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Adele is a lively and observant young girl who is currently under the care of her guardian, Mr. Rochester. She is described as a &quot;curious study&quot; by Mr Rochester, suggesting that she is an interesting subject to observe due to her unique characteristics and behaviors.&#10;&#10;One characteristic of Adele that the speaker notes is her love of fashion and dressing up. The narrative describes her getting excited about a pink silk dress and rushing to try it on. This suggests that Adele has a strong interest in clothing and personal style.&#10;&#10;Another observation made about Adele is her fluency in French, as well as her use of French phrases in her speech. This indicates that she may have spent time in France or has French heritage.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Adele's behavior and reactions throughout the narrative suggest that she is a bright and observant child. She notices when Mr. Rochester's language becomes &quot;enigmatical,&quot; indicating that she is able to pick up on social cues and understand when something is unclear or confusing.&#10;&#10;Overall, Adele is described as a curious study due to her unique personality traits, including her love of fashion, fluency in French, and observant nature." />

My&#10;position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,&#10;favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally&#10;watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious&#10;study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).&#10;She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk&#10;frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her&#10;blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il&#10;faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed&#10;out of the room.  She is" />

Ask me&#10;questions, and I will do my best to answer them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be&#10;a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I&#10;stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have&#10;battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and&#10;roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of&#10;people in one house?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do as" />

He bent his head a little towards me, and with a&#10;single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stubborn?&quot; he said, &quot;and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my&#10;request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your&#10;pardon.

Opening the window, I walked in upon&#10;them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her&#10;hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,&#10;hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with&#10;the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.

    <node id=" In the passage, the speaker, Jane Eyre, has just saved Mr. Rochester from a fire in his room at night. She had gone to his room after hearing a commotion to find him in danger. After ensuring his safety, she refuses his invitation to stay and prefers to return to her own room. However, Mr. Rochester expresses his gratitude for her life-saving actions and insists that she shake hands with him. He tells her that he always knew she would do him good someday and that he considers her a friend rather than just a subordinate.&#10;&#10;Jane initially downplayed her actions, stating that there was no debt or obligation between them. However, Mr. Rochester insists on thanking her and expresses his admiration for her character. Despite this, Jane feels uncomfortable and decides to leave, feeling that the conversation has become too intimate and confusing for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane did not explicitly do anything to deserve such gratitude from Mr. Rochester. Instead, she simply acted in a way that any decent person would have in a similar situation - by saving his life. However, her modesty and reluctance to accept praise or recognition for her actions may have made Mr. Rochester's gratitude even more profound.&#10;&#10;Jane left without acknowledging his thanks because she felt overwhelmed and out of her depth in the conversation. She may have also been concerned about the potential implications of such a close relationship with her employer, given the power dynamic between them. Nonetheless, her actions demonstrate her humility, integrity, and strong sense of self-worth." />

What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,&#10;I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will&#10;you agree to let me hector a little?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,&#10;and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his&#10;dependency, I agree heartily.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms&#10;and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I&#10;rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a&#10;salary.&quot;" />

    <node id=" In the narrative, Mr. Rochester describes a moment from his past when he saw Celine, his &quot;flame&quot; or opera inamorata, arriving in an elegant carriage drawn by English horses. This occurred when he was strolling on the fashionable streets of a city and waiting for the opera-goers to return. When he spotted Celine's carriage, he recognized it and felt impatient as he watched her alight at the hotel. The description of this moment suggests that Rochester had strong emotions connected to Celine, which are further explored in his narrative about their past relationship." />
    <node id=" cigar,--I will take one&#10;now, if you will excuse me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;&#10;having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on&#10;the freezing and sunless air, he went on--&#10;&#10;&quot;I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was&#10;_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and&#10;smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along&#10;the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an&#10;elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and&#10;distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I&#10;had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with&#10;impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as&#10;I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an&#10;opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary&#10;encumbrance, by-the-bye," />

Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!&quot;&#10;&#10;And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having&#10;reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,&#10;then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--&#10;&#10;&quot;Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;&quot; then rising, she&#10;added, &quot;C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Pre-cise-ly!&quot; was the answer; &quot;and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English&#10;gold out of my British breeches' pocket.

    <node id=" I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had&#10;said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of&#10;the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,&#10;and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in&#10;society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of&#10;emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of&#10;expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived&#10;pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on&#10;this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present&#10;inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to&#10;myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a&#10;tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His&#10;deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at&#10;the first.

It was one&#10;afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while&#10;she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and&#10;down a long beech avenue within sight of her.&#10;&#10;He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine&#10;Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a &quot;_grande&#10;passion_.&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the speaker, Mr. Rochester, has formed a theory about the man's character, despite his moodiness and harshness. The speaker believes that the man has &quot;excellent materials&quot; in him, including good tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes. However, these qualities are currently &quot;spoiled and tangled,&quot; suggesting that the man has the potential for improvement but is currently held back by negative influences.&#10;&#10;The speaker attributes the man's negative qualities to a &quot;cruel cross of fate,&quot; implying that circumstances, education, or destiny have played a role in shaping his character. This suggests that the speaker believes that the man is not inherently bad, but has been influenced by external factors beyond his control.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the speaker grieves for the man's grief, indicating that they have some level of empathy and concern for him. Despite his moodiness and harshness, the speaker sees potential in the man and believes that he is capable of change.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Adele is an interesting and unique child who loves fashion and dressing up, as evidenced by her excitement over a pink silk dress and her eagerness to try it on. She is also fluent in French, using French phrases in her speech, which suggests that she may have spent time in France or has French heritage. Adele's observant nature is also highlighted in the text, as she notices when the speaker's language becomes unclear and reacts accordingly. The speaker finds Adele to be a curious study due to these unique personality traits, which make her an intriguing subject to observe and analyze.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Adele's backstory of being an illegitimate child of a French opera-girl adds another layer to her character, making her even more of a curious study. The speaker initially expresses concern that Adele's background may affect the speaker's perception of her as a potential protegee, but ultimately decides to cling closer to her due to her orphan status and vulnerability.&#10;&#10;In summary, Adele is a curious study due to her unique personality traits, including her love of fashion, fluency in French, and observant nature. Her backstory as an illegitimate child of a French opera-girl also adds intrigue to her character." />

    <node id="&#10;What is strange about Mr. Rochester's sudden emotion while telling the tale of his passion for a French dancer is that he became extremely emotional during a moment when he was expressing his present contentment and happiness. This outburst seemed unusual and inexplicable, as there was nothing particularly remarkable about the substance of his narrative.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's manner towards Jane indicates trust in her discretion because he confides in her by sharing his personal story with her. By doing so, he is tacitly acknowledging that he considers her to be a trustworthy and discreet individual who can be relied upon to keep his confidence. This gesture can be seen as a form of respect for Jane's character and a recognition of her maturity and good judgment." />

However, when he saw her with another man, it triggered intense emotions of jealousy, which he compared to a green snake &quot;eating its way in two minutes to my heart's core.&quot; This sudden realization of Celine's betrayal affected him emotionally, causing him to become extremely emotional during a moment when he was expressing his present contentment and happiness." />

This is evident when Jane initially and candidly replies &quot;No, sir&quot; when asked if she thinks him handsome, which takes Mr. Rochester by surprise. He interprets her behavior as fear, but it is actually due to Jane's plain-spokenness and lack of tact in that particular situation.&#10;&#10;In their conversation, Jane responds to this accusation by denying that she is afraid of him. She explains that she was &quot;too plain&quot; in her response, expressing regret for perhaps hurting his feelings or being overly blunt. Jane's intention is not to fear or offend Mr. Rochester but rather to be honest and true to herself.&#10;&#10;Overall, the reason for Mr. Rochester's claim that Jane is afraid of him is a misunderstanding based on Jane's plain-spokenness and lack of tact, which he interprets as fear.

    <node id=" In this narrative excerpt from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Charlotte Bronte, Mr. Rochester is justifying his behavior towards Jane Eyre, who is his governess. He argues that his age and life experiences give him the right to be demanding and assertive with her.&#10;&#10;However, whether or not this justification is valid depends on one's perspective. On the one hand, Mr. Rochester does have more life experience than Jane, which could potentially give him insight into situations that she lacks. Additionally, as the employer, he may feel a sense of responsibility towards her and believe that being assertive is necessary to ensure her well-being.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, it's important to note that Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane is not always appropriate or respectful. For example, he makes assumptions about her thoughts and feelings without giving her a chance to speak for herself. He also dismisses her opinions and concerns, which could be demoralizing and disempowering for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may feel justified in being assertive towards Jane due to his age and experience, it's not necessarily justifiable if his behavior is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective. Ultimately, effective communication and mutual respect are key to any successful working relationship." />

By comparing his heart to these two types of places, the speaker is suggesting that it was once a place of death and despair, but is now a place of life and reverence.

    <node id=" knew him for a young roue of a&#10;vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in&#10;society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so&#10;absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was&#10;instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank&#10;under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was&#10;not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,&#10;who had been her dupe.&#10;&#10;&quot;They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,&#10;mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary&#10;than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being&#10;perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed&#10;energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as&#10;they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather&#10;brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it&#10;had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester's statement that Jane has saved his life and that he feels no burden or obligation towards her highlights several important aspects of their relationship. Firstly, it shows his recognition and appreciation for Jane's life-saving actions, which is significant given the power dynamic between them as employer and employee.&#10;&#10;Secondly, by stating that he feels no burden or obligation towards her, Mr. Rochester is acknowledging Jane's autonomy and agency as a person. He is recognizing that she acted out of her own free will and did not expect anything in return, which is consistent with Jane's character as someone who values her independence and integrity.&#10;&#10;Finally, this statement also foreshadows the development of their relationship beyond just employer and employee. By expressing his admiration for Jane's character and considering her a friend rather than just a subordinate, Mr. Rochester is laying the groundwork for a deeper connection with her.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester's statement reflects his growing respect and appreciation for Jane as a person, as well as his recognition of her autonomy and agency. It also hints at the potential for a deeper relationship between them beyond just their professional roles." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Miss Eyre is prevented from being natural and displaying vivacity and variety in her looks and movements due to the lingering constraints of her upbringing at Lowood, which emphasized strictness and constraint. She fears appearing too informal or forward in the presence of a man like Mr. Rochester, whom she may view as a superior or authority figure.&#10;&#10;Miss Eyre can learn to be more natural over time by becoming more comfortable with Mr. Rochester and recognizing that he values her authenticity and individuality. As she spends more time with him and develops a stronger relationship, she may feel less constrained by societal expectations and more free to express herself openly and spontaneously. Additionally, Mr. Rochester's willingness to be unconventional and informal in his interactions with her may help create a more relaxed atmosphere that allows Miss Eyre to be more natural and at ease." />
    <node id="&#09;In the narrative, Mr. Rochester reflects on the impact of his past experiences on his life and how they have influenced his memory and moral character, comparing himself to when he was eighteen. He describes his memory at eighteen as &quot;limpid, salubrious&quot; with no negative influences yet, suggesting that he saw himself as a good person with potential for improvement.&#10;&#10;&#09;However, since turning twenty-one, Mr. Rochester believes that unfavorable experiences have influenced his life and personal growth negatively. He admits to being a &quot;trite commonplace sinner&quot; and attributes this to circumstances beyond his control rather than his inherent nature. He expresses regret and a desire to change his ways, indicating a willingness to take responsibility for his actions and make positive changes in his life.&#10;&#10;&#09;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester acknowledges the value of the listener's (Miss Eyre's) listening skills and implies that he trusts her judgment, further suggesting a desire to improve himself. Overall, Mr. Rochester recognizes both his potential for improvement and the negative influences that have held him back since turning eighteen." />
    <node id="The individual being addressed in this text, Miss Eyre, is observed to be uncommon in her frank and sincere manner. This trait can be attributed to several factors, including her natural disposition, upbringing, and personal values that prioritize honesty and authenticity. The fact that Mr. Rochester initially finds her plain-spokenness surprising suggests that such honesty is not a common occurrence in their social circles, further highlighting Miss Eyre's uniqueness.&#10;&#10;While nature (i.e., Miss Eyre's innate personality traits) certainly plays a role in shaping her sincere manner, it is also possible that nurture (i.e., her upbringing and experiences) has influenced this trait as well. For example, Miss Eyre may have been raised in an environment where honesty was valued over social niceties or learned through personal experiences that emphasized the importance of authenticity.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is likely a combination of both nature and nurture that contributes to Miss Eyre's uncommon frankness and sincerity. Her natural disposition may have made her more inclined towards honesty, while her upbringing and experiences further reinforced this trait. However, regardless of the specific factors that contribute to her sincerity, it is clear that such a trait reflects positively on Miss Eyre's character, highlighting her integrity, authenticity, and trustworthiness." />
    <node id=" The smoke and strong smell of burning in Mr. Rochester's room are being caused by a fire that has broken out in his room. The flames had engulfed his bed and its curtains were on fire. It is not explicitly mentioned where Grace Poole is at this point, but it is heavily implied that she is the cause of the fire. This is suggested when Jane wonders &quot;Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?&quot; after hearing footsteps and a door closing in the gallery near Grace Poole's room. Later, Mr. Rochester also implies that Grace Poole was responsible for starting the fire when he says to Jane, &quot;You are no talking fool: say nothing...I am glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of tonight's incident.&quot; This suggests that Mr. Rochester plans to keep the matter of Grace Poole's involvement in the fire a secret." />
    <node id="  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery&#10;towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut&#10;in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?&quot; thought I.&#10;Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I&#10;hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door&#10;with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on&#10;the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but&#10;still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with&#10;smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence&#10;these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of&#10;burning.&#10;&#10;Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,&#10;and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.&#10;Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an" />
    <node id=" a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.&#10;Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I&#10;was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the&#10;curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester&#10;lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.&#10;&#10;&quot;Wake! wake!&quot; I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the&#10;smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets&#10;were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide&#10;and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,&#10;deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my&#10;own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in&#10;extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.&#10;&#10;The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung&#10;from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all" />
    <node id=" hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung&#10;from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the&#10;shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.&#10;Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him&#10;fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of&#10;water.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is there a flood?&quot; he cried.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir,&quot; I answered; &quot;but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are&#10;quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?&quot; he&#10;demanded.  &quot;What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the&#10;room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody&#10;has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There!  I am up now; but at your peril you" />
    <node id=" peculiar and lugubrious,&#10;which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle&#10;burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose&#10;and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.&#10;&#10;I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward&#10;tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.&#10;Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept&#10;the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, &quot;Who&#10;is there?&quot;  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.&#10;&#10;All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-&#10;door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the&#10;threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself&#10;in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence&#10;composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through&#10;the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. " />
    <node id=" The text does not provide direct information about why Mr. Rochester, also referred to as Charles in the supporting materials, requests Jane's company and encourages her to speak freely on any topic she chooses. However, based on the given context, we can infer some possible reasons.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Mr. Rochester might be seeking companionship and a different perspective from Jane, who comes from a different background and has a fresh outlook on life. By encouraging her to speak freely, he creates an environment where they can engage in open and honest conversations, allowing for a deeper connection between them.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Mr. Rochester may be testing Jane's character and intelligence by asking her opinion on various topics. He could be trying to evaluate her suitability as a conversational partner or even assessing her potential as a life partner, given his growing interest in her.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, Mr. Rochester might simply enjoy Jane's company and appreciate her wit, sincerity, and unique viewpoint. Her candidness and lack of tact may initially surprise him, but he ultimately values her honesty and authenticity.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text does not explicitly provide a reason for Mr. Rochester's request for Jane's company and encouragement for her to speak freely, it can be inferred that he seeks companionship, desires a fresh perspective, tests her character, or enjoys her company." />
    <node id="after her encounter with Mr. Rochester, Jane experienced conflicting emotions of surprise, discomfort, and regret. She was surprised by Mr. Rochester's sudden question about her thinking him handsome, and her initial response of &quot;No, sir&quot; took him by surprise. This made her feel uncomfortable and hesitant, as she realized that she might have hurt his feelings or been overly blunt in her response. Jane also felt regret for not phrasing her answer more tactfully to soften the potential impact of her words.&#10;&#10;To free her hand from Mr. Rochester's grasp, Jane used a strategy of polite firmness. She did not pull away abruptly or forcefully, as this might have been seen as disrespectful or confrontational. Instead, she calmly and confidently explained her reasons for denying his accusation that she was afraid of him, emphasizing that she was not afraid but rather candid in their conversations. This approach allowed her to assert her autonomy and agency while still maintaining a respectful and courteous demeanor." />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre did not explicitly do anything to deserve such gratitude from Mr. Rochester beyond saving his life, which she did out of a sense of duty and without expectation of reward or recognition. However, her modesty and reluctance to accept praise may have made Mr. Rochester's gratitude even more profound. Jane felt uncomfortable with the conversation becoming too intimate and potentially inappropriate given their power dynamic as employer and employee. Nonetheless, her actions demonstrate her humility, integrity, and strong sense of self-worth." />
    <node id=" Based on the information provided in the narrative, Adele's mother is not explicitly named or directly referred to. However, it is mentioned that Adele has French heritage and uses French phrases in her speech, which suggests a possible connection to Celine Varens, Mr. Rochester's former lover who is described as having French origins.&#10;&#10;It is also noted that Adele's mother was not married to Mr. Rochester and did not have a serious or long-lasting relationship with him. In fact, Mr. Rochester describes Celine as a &quot;harlot&quot; and a &quot;deceitful woman,&quot; indicating that she may have been involved in relationships or activities that were not considered respectable at the time.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester has custody of Adele because he claims to be her father, although this is later revealed to be false. It is possible that Mr. Rochester took responsibility for Adele out of a sense of duty or obligation, as she was born during his relationship with Celine and may have been left in a precarious situation without his support.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the narrative does not provide explicit information about Adele's mother, it suggests that she was a woman from France who had a brief and unstable relationship with Mr. Rochester, leading to the birth of Adele and Mr. Rochester's subsequent custody of her." />
    <node id=" stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race&#10;with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went&#10;in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept&#10;her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking&#10;even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to&#10;stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of&#10;character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an&#10;English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate&#10;all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and&#10;features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn&#10;of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but&#10;have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.&#10;&#10;It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,&#10;that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had&#10;said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of&#10;the" />
    <node id=" After receiving the message from Adele that his agent had come to see him, the narrator (who is not named in the passage) abruptly ended his conversation with Adele about her observations on his physical appearance and went to attend to his agent. The narrator's actions suggest a sense of urgency and importance associated with his agent's visit, as he leaves his conversation with Adele unfinished and attends to business matters. It is also possible that the narrator was expecting the agent's visit and had scheduled it in advance, given that he interrupts his discussion with Adele to attend to the agent's needs. However, the passage does not provide explicit details about the nature of the agent's visit or the reason for the urgency." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester requests for Miss Eyre to converse with him because he values her listening skills and trusts her judgment. He believes that she can provide a different perspective and help him improve himself. He sees their age difference and his life experiences as giving him a sense of superiority in their relationship, implying that he has more wisdom and insight than Miss Eyre due to his age. He also feels responsible for her well-being as her employer and believes that being assertive is necessary to ensure it. However, this justification may not be entirely valid if his behavior towards Jane is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective." />

Mr. Rochester challenges this assertion, claiming that the other character has no way of knowing whether it will be bitter or not, as they have never tried it.

He argues that his age and life experiences give him the right to be demanding and assertive with her.&#10;&#10;However, whether or not this justification is valid depends on one's perspective. On the one hand, Mr. Rochester does have more life experience than Jane, which could potentially give him insight into situations that she lacks. Additionally, as the employer, he may feel a sense of responsibility towards her and believe that being assertive is necessary to ensure her well-being.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, it's important to note that Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane is not always appropriate or respectful. For example, he makes assumptions about her thoughts and feelings without giving her a chance to speak for herself. He also dismisses her opinions and concerns, which could be demoralizing and disempowering for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may feel justified in being assertive towards Jane due to his age and experience, it's not necessarily justifiable if his behavior is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective.

On the one hand, Mr. Rochester does have more life experience than Jane, which could potentially give him insight into situations that she lacks. Additionally, as the employer, he may feel a sense of responsibility towards her and believe that being assertive is necessary to ensure her well-being.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, it's important to note that Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane is not always appropriate or respectful. For example, he makes assumptions about her thoughts and feelings without giving her a chance to speak for herself. He also dismisses her opinions and concerns, which could be demoralizing and disempowering for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may feel justified in being assertive towards Jane due to his age and experience, it's not necessarily justifiable if his behavior is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective. Ultimately, effective communication and mutual respect are key to any successful working relationship.">

He argues that his age and life experiences give him the right to be demanding and assertive with her.&#10;&#10;However, whether or not this justification is valid depends on one's perspective. On the one hand, Mr. Rochester does have more life experience than Jane, which could potentially give him insight into situations that she lacks. Additionally, as the employer, he may feel a sense of responsibility towards her and believe that being assertive is necessary to ensure her well-being.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, it's important to note that Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane is not always appropriate or respectful. For example, he makes assumptions about her thoughts and feelings without giving her a chance to speak for herself. He also dismisses her opinions and concerns, which could be demoralizing and disempowering for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may feel justified in being assertive towards Jane due to his age and experience, it's not necessarily justifiable if his behavior is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective. Ultimately, effective communication and mutual respect are key to any successful working relationship.">

He argues that his age and life experiences give him the right to be demanding and assertive with her.&#10;&#10;However, whether or not this justification is valid depends on one's perspective. On the one hand, Mr. Rochester does have more life experience than Jane, which could potentially give him insight into situations that she lacks. Additionally, as the employer, he may feel a sense of responsibility towards her and believe that being assertive is necessary to ensure her well-being.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, it's important to note that Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane is not always appropriate or respectful. For example, he makes assumptions about her thoughts and feelings without giving her a chance to speak for herself. He also dismisses her opinions and concerns, which could be demoralizing and disempowering for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may feel justified in being assertive towards Jane due to his age and experience, it's not necessarily justifiable if his behavior is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective. Ultimately, effective communication and mutual respect are key to any successful working relationship.">

    <edge source=" I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had&#10;said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of&#10;the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,&#10;and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in&#10;society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of&#10;emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of&#10;expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived&#10;pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on&#10;this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present&#10;inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to&#10;myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a&#10;tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His&#10;deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at&#10;the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling&#10;hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he&#10;had always a word" target="&#10;What is strange about Mr. Rochester's sudden emotion while telling the tale of his passion for a French dancer is that he became extremely emotional during a moment when he was expressing his present contentment and happiness. This outburst seemed unusual and inexplicable, as there was nothing particularly remarkable about the substance of his narrative.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's manner towards Jane indicates trust in her discretion because he confides in her by sharing his personal story with her. By doing so, he is tacitly acknowledging that he considers her to be a trustworthy and discreet individual who can be relied upon to keep his confidence. This gesture can be seen as a form of respect for Jane's character and a recognition of her maturity and good judgment.">

He describes his memory at eighteen as &quot;limpid, salubrious&quot; with no negative influences yet, suggesting that he saw himself as a good person with potential for improvement.&#10;&#10;&#09;However, since turning twenty-one, Mr. Rochester believes that unfavorable experiences have influenced his life and personal growth negatively.

He expresses regret and a desire to change his ways, indicating a willingness to take responsibility for his actions and make positive changes in his life.&#10;&#10;&#09;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester acknowledges the value of the listener's (Miss Eyre's) listening skills and implies that he trusts her judgment, further suggesting a desire to improve himself.

He believes that this pleasure can be as sweet and fresh as wild honey, and that it is uncertain whether it will taste bitter or not until he tries it. He dismisses the potential negative consequences lightly by suggesting that the person warning him of these consequences (referred to as &quot;you&quot;) is ignorant of the matter and has no right to preach to him.&#10;&#10;He justifies his pursuit of pleasure by stating that he has a right to not be burdened and hampered by his circumstances, and that he may be able to reform in the future if necessary.

Her natural disposition may have made her more inclined towards honesty, while her upbringing and experiences further reinforced this trait. However, regardless of the specific factors that contribute to her sincerity, it is clear that such a trait reflects positively on Miss Eyre's character, highlighting her integrity, authenticity, and trustworthiness.">

He argues that his age and life experiences give him the right to be demanding and assertive with her.&#10;&#10;However, whether or not this justification is valid depends on one's perspective. On the one hand, Mr. Rochester does have more life experience than Jane, which could potentially give him insight into situations that she lacks. Additionally, as the employer, he may feel a sense of responsibility towards her and believe that being assertive is necessary to ensure her well-being.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, it's important to note that Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane is not always appropriate or respectful. For example, he makes assumptions about her thoughts and feelings without giving her a chance to speak for herself. He also dismisses her opinions and concerns, which could be demoralizing and disempowering for her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may feel justified in being assertive towards Jane due to his age and experience, it's not necessarily justifiable if his behavior is disrespectful or dismissive of her perspective.

This trait can be attributed to several factors, including her natural disposition, upbringing, and personal values that prioritize honesty and authenticity. The fact that Mr. Rochester initially finds her plain-spokenness surprising suggests that such honesty is not a common occurrence in their social circles, further highlighting Miss Eyre's uniqueness.&#10;&#10;While nature (i.e., Miss Eyre's innate personality traits) certainly plays a role in shaping her sincere manner, it is also possible that nurture (i.e., her upbringing and experiences) has influenced this trait as well. For example, Miss Eyre may have been raised in an environment where honesty was valued over social niceties or learned through personal experiences that emphasized the importance of authenticity.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is likely a combination of both nature and nurture that contributes to Miss Eyre's uncommon frankness and sincerity. Her natural disposition may have made her more inclined towards honesty, while her upbringing and experiences further reinforced this trait. However, regardless of the specific factors that contribute to her sincerity, it is clear that such a trait reflects positively on Miss Eyre's character, highlighting her integrity, authenticity, and trustworthiness.">

Overall, Mr. Rochester recognizes both his potential for improvement and the negative influences that have held him back since turning eighteen." target="The individual being addressed in this text, Miss Eyre, is observed to be uncommon in her frank and sincere manner. This trait can be attributed to several factors, including her natural disposition, upbringing, and personal values that prioritize honesty and authenticity. The fact that Mr. Rochester initially finds her plain-spokenness surprising suggests that such honesty is not a common occurrence in their social circles, further highlighting Miss Eyre's uniqueness.&#10;&#10;While nature (i.e., Miss Eyre's innate personality traits) certainly plays a role in shaping her sincere manner, it is also possible that nurture (i.e., her upbringing and experiences) has influenced this trait as well. For example, Miss Eyre may have been raised in an environment where honesty was valued over social niceties or learned through personal experiences that emphasized the importance of authenticity.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is likely a combination of both nature and nurture that contributes to Miss Eyre's uncommon frankness and sincerity. Her natural disposition may have made her more inclined towards honesty, while her upbringing and experiences further reinforced this trait.

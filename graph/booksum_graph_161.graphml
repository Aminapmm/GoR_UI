    <node id="Yes, based on the narrative, Mr. Pyncheon might consider discussing the carpenter's condition of giving up his house. This is because he has no personal attachment to the house and is aware that his grandfather's presence still pervades it, creating unsettling feelings. Additionally, Mr. Pyncheon acknowledges the popular belief about a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions, which may prompt him to take the carpenter's proposal more seriously. However, the narrative does not provide a definitive answer regarding his final decision." />
    <node id="&#10;    mentioned aside.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Give up this house!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, in amazement at the&#10;    proposal.  &quot;Were I to do so, my grandfather would not rest quiet in his&#10;    grave!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;He never has, if all stories are true,&quot; remarked the carpenter&#10;    composedly.  &quot;But that matter concerns his grandson more than it does&#10;    Matthew Maule.  I have no other terms to propose.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Impossible as he at first thought it to comply with Maule's conditions,&#10;    still, on a second glance, Mr. Pyncheon was of opinion that they might&#10;    at least be made matter of discussion.  He himself had no personal&#10;    attachment for the house, nor any pleasant associations connected with&#10;    his childish residence in it.  On the contrary, after seven-and-thirty&#10;    years, the presence of his dead grandfather seemed still to pervade it,&#10;    as on that morning when the affrighted boy had beheld him, with so&#10;    ghastly an" />

It was an ordinary saying that the old wizard, hanged&#10;    though he was, had obtained the best end of the bargain in his contest&#10;    with Colonel Pyncheon; inasmuch as he had got possession of the" />
    <node id=" The carpenter, however, stepped at once to the hearth, and turned&#10;    himself about, so as to look Mr. Pyncheon in the face.&#10;&#10;    &quot;You sent for me,&quot; said he.  &quot;Be pleased to explain your business, that&#10;    I may go back to my own affairs.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Ah! excuse me,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon quietly.  &quot;I did not mean to tax&#10;    your time without a recompense.  Your name, I think, is Maule,--Thomas&#10;    or Matthew Maule,--a son or grandson of the builder of this house?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Matthew Maule,&quot; replied the carpenter,--&quot;son of him who built the&#10;    house,--grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I know the dispute to which you allude,&quot; observed Mr. Pyncheon with&#10;    undisturbed equanimity.  &quot;I am well aware that my grandfather was&#10;    compelled to resort to a suit at law, in order to establish his claim&#10;    to the foundation-site of this" />
    <node id=" of disapproval; but without&#10;    effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he&#10;    thought he beheld his grandfather frown.&#10;&#10;    &quot;This sherry is too potent a wine for me; it has affected my brain&#10;    already,&quot; he observed, after a somewhat startled look at the picture.&#10;    &quot;On returning to Europe, I shall confine myself to the more delicate&#10;    vintages of Italy and France, the best of which will not bear&#10;    transportation.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;My Lord Pyncheon may drink what wine he will, and wherever he&#10;    pleases,&quot; replied the carpenter, as if he had been privy to Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon's ambitious projects.  &quot;But first, sir, if you desire tidings&#10;    of this lost document, I must crave the favor of a little talk with&#10;    your fair daughter Alice.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;You are mad, Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at&#10;    last, there was anger mixed up with his pride." />
    <node id="   Colonel Pyncheon, as his grandson distinctly recollected, had been&#10;    spread out on the table.&#10;&#10;    Matthew Maule understood the insinuated suspicion.&#10;&#10;    &quot;My father,&quot; he said,--but still there was that dark smile, making a&#10;    riddle of his countenance,--&quot;my father was an honester man than the&#10;    bloody old Colonel! Not to get his rights back again would he have&#10;    carried off one of those papers!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I shall not bandy words with you,&quot; observed the foreign-bred Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon, with haughty composure.  &quot;Nor will it become me to resent any&#10;    rudeness towards either my grandfather or myself.  A gentleman, before&#10;    seeking intercourse with a person of your station and habits, will&#10;    first consider whether the urgency of the end may compensate for the&#10;    disagreeableness of the means.  It does so in the present instance.&quot;&#10;&#10;    He then renewed the conversation, and made great pecuniary offers to&#10;    the carpenter, in" />
    <node id="THERE was a message brought, one day, from the worshipful Gervayse&#10;Pyncheon to young Matthew Maule, the carpenter, desiring his immediate&#10;presence at the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what does your master want with me?&quot; said the carpenter to Mr.&#10;Pyncheon's black servant.  &quot;Does the house need any repair?  Well it&#10;may, by this time; and no blame to my father who built it, neither! I&#10;was reading the old Colonel's tombstone, no longer ago than last&#10;Sabbath; and, reckoning from that date, the house has stood&#10;seven-and-thirty years.  No wonder if there should be a job to do on&#10;the roof.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't know what massa wants,&quot; answered Scipio.  &quot;The house is a berry&#10;good house, and old Colonel Pyncheon think so too, I reckon;--else why&#10;the old man haunt it so, and frighten a poor nigga, As he does?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well, friend Scipio; let your master know that I'm coming,&quot; said&#10;the carpenter with a laugh" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Matthew Maule, the carpenter, goes to the main entrance of the Pyncheon house instead of the back door or side entrance for servants and work-people, as an assertion of his rightful claim to the land. His grandfather originally owned the land where the Pyncheon House now stands, having built his own cottage there. The carpenter's decision to use the main entrance emphasizes his family's historical connection to the property and symbolically challenges the Pyncheons' ownership." />

But the&#10;   carpenter had a great deal of pride and stiffness in his nature; and,&#10;   at this moment, moreover, his heart was bitter with the sense of&#10;   hereditary wrong, because he considered the great Pyncheon House to be&#10;   standing on soil which should have been his own.  On this very site,&#10;   beside a spring of delicious water, his grandfather had felled the&#10;   pine-trees and built a cottage, in which children had been born to him;&#10;   and it was only from a dead man's stiffened fingers that Colonel&#10;   Pyncheon had wrested away the title-deeds.  So young Maule went&#10;   straight to the principal entrance, beneath a portal of carved oak, and&#10;   gave such a peal of the iron knocker that you would have imagined the&#10;   stern old wizard himself to be standing at the threshold.&#10;&#10; " />

Had he not bequeathed a legacy of hatred against the Pyncheons&#10;    to this only grandson, who, as it appeared, was now about to exercise a&#10;    subtle influence over the daughter of his enemy's house?  Might not&#10;    this influence be the same that was called witchcraft?&#10;&#10;    Turning half around, he caught a glimpse of Maule's figure in the&#10;    looking-glass.  At some paces from Alice, with his arms uplifted in the&#10;    air, the carpenter made a gesture as if directing downward a slow,&#10;    ponderous, and invisible weight upon the maiden.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Stay, Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, stepping forward.  &quot;I forbid&#10;    your proceeding further!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Pray, my dear father, do not interrupt the young man,&quot; said Alice,&#10;    without changing her position.  &quot;His efforts, I assure you, will prove&#10;  " />

On the entrance of Scipio, ushering in the carpenter, Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon turned partly round, but resumed his former position, and&#10;    proceeded deliberately to finish his cup of coffee, without immediate&#10;    notice of the guest whom he had summoned to his presence.  It was not&#10;    that he intended any rudeness or improper neglect,--which, indeed, he&#10;    would have blushed to be guilty of,--but it never occurred to him that&#10;    a person in Maule's station had a claim on his courtesy, or would&#10;    trouble himself about it one way or the other.&#10;&#10;    The carpenter, however, stepped at once to the hearth, and turned&#10;    himself about, so as to look Mr. Pyncheon" />
    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon is asking Alice, his daughter, to assist Matthew Maule in the attempt to locate a missing document that holds significant importance for the Pyncheon family. The missing document is a parchment or paper that went missing long before Alice's birth. Its discovery is considered crucial due to its importance for the Pyncheons.&#10;&#10;Matthew Maule, a carpenter, claims to have the ability to find this missing document through Alice's help. The reason behind Maule's confidence lies in the belief that her &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; can serve as a clear medium for him to access the spiritual world, where he hopes to gain information about the lost parchment from departed individuals who might have custody of the secret.&#10;&#10;Mr. Pyncheon initially expresses reluctance but eventually agrees to let Alice participate, driven by his desire to restore the family's fortune and prospects for an advantageous marriage for his daughter, as well as out of respect for her will. The situation revolves around a peculiar blend of familial ambition, supernatural elements, and the connection between the Pyncheon and Maule families." />
    <node id=", Alice,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and confusion.&#10;    &quot;This young man--his name is Matthew Maule--professes, so far as I can&#10;    understand him, to be able to discover, through your means, a certain&#10;    paper or parchment, which was missing long before your birth.  The&#10;    importance of the document in question renders it advisable to neglect&#10;    no possible, even if improbable, method of regaining it.  You will&#10;    therefore oblige me, my dear Alice, by answering this person's&#10;    inquiries, and complying with his lawful and reasonable requests, so&#10;    far as they may appear to have the aforesaid object in view.  As I&#10;    shall remain in the room, you need apprehend no rude nor unbecoming&#10;    deportment, on the young man's part; and, at your slightest wish, of&#10;    course, the investigation, or whatever we may call it, shall&#10;    immediately be broken off.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Mistress Alice Pyncheon,&quot; remarked Matthew Maule, with the utmost&#10; " />
    <node id="   that made Maule so subtile in his preception.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Does the girl look at me as if I were a brute beast?&quot; thought he,&#10;    setting his teeth.  &quot;She shall know whether I have a human spirit; and&#10;    the worse for her, if it prove stronger than her own!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;My father, you sent for me,&quot; said Alice, in her sweet and harp-like&#10;    voice.  &quot;But, if you have business with this young man, pray let me go&#10;    again.  You know I do not love this room, in spite of that Claude, with&#10;    which you try to bring back sunny recollections.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Stay a moment, young lady, if you please!&quot; said Matthew Maule.  &quot;My&#10;    business with your father is over.  With yourself, it is now to begin!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Alice looked towards her father, in surprise and inquiry.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Yes, Alice,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and confusion.&#10;    &quot;This young man--his name is Matthew Maule--" />
    <node id=" Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at&#10;    last, there was anger mixed up with his pride.  &quot;What can my daughter&#10;    have to do with a business like this?&quot;&#10;&#10;    Indeed, at this new demand on the carpenter's part, the proprietor of&#10;    the Seven Gables was even more thunder-struck than at the cool&#10;    proposition to surrender his house.  There was, at least, an assignable&#10;    motive for the first stipulation; there appeared to be none whatever&#10;    for the last.  Nevertheless, Matthew Maule sturdily insisted on the&#10;    young lady being summoned, and even gave her father to understand, in a&#10;    mysterious kind of explanation,--which made the matter considerably&#10;    darker than it looked before,--that the only chance of acquiring the&#10;    requisite knowledge was through the clear, crystal medium of a pure and&#10;    virgin intelligence, like that of the fair Alice.  Not to encumber our&#10;    story with Mr. Pyncheon's scruples, whether of conscience" />
    <node id="ly, as&#10;    tending to her sure and inevitable centre,--the proud Alice approached&#10;    him.  He waved her back, and, retreating, Alice sank again into her&#10;    seat.&#10;&#10;    &quot;She is mine!&quot; said Matthew Maule.  &quot;Mine, by the right of the&#10;    strongest spirit!&quot;&#10;&#10;    In the further progress of the legend, there is a long, grotesque, and&#10;    occasionally awe-striking account of the carpenter's incantations (if&#10;            so they are to be called), with a view of discovering the lost&#10;    document.  It appears to have been his object to convert the mind of&#10;    Alice into a kind of telescopic medium, through which Mr. Pyncheon and&#10;    himself might obtain a glimpse into the spiritual world.  He succeeded,&#10;    accordingly, in holding an imperfect sort of intercourse, at one&#10;    remove, with the departed personages in whose custody the so much&#10;    valued secret had been carried beyond the precincts of earth.

It was then his&#10;    daughter's will, in opposition to his own, that the experiment should&#10;    be fully tried.  Henceforth, therefore, he did but consent, not urge&#10;    it.  And was it not for her sake far more than for his own that he&#10;    desired its success? That lost parchment once restored, the beautiful&#10;    Alice Pyncheon, with the rich dowry which he could then bestow, might&#10;    wed an English duke or a German reigning-prince, instead of some New&#10;    England clergyman or lawyer! At the thought, the ambitious father&#10;    almost consented, in his heart, that, if the devil's power were needed&#10;    to the accomplishment of this great object, Maule might evoke him.&#10;    Alice's own purity would be her safeguard.&#10;&#10;    With his mind full of" />
    <node id="Matthew Maule, the carpenter, chose to go to the main entrance of the Pyncheon house instead of the back door or side entrance for servants and work-people as an expression of his family's historical connection to the property. This action symbolized his challenge to the Pyncheons' ownership, emphasizing that his grandfather had originally owned the land where the Pyncheon House now stands. He made this decision due to his prideful nature and his bitterness about the Pyncheons having obtained the title-deeds to his family's property unjustly." />
    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon's frustration and urgency in his efforts to awaken Alice stem from the carpenter Matthew Maule's request to speak with her directly. Mr. Pyncheon realizes that something unusual is happening, as Alice does not respond to his calls despite being sensitive to loud noises.&#10;&#10;The reason for Alice's lack of response is due to her entranced state, induced by Matthew Maule through her &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot; This supernatural phenomenon allows Maule to access the spiritual world, where he believes the necessary information about the missing parchment can be found among departed individuals who might have custody of the secret.&#10;&#10;In this entranced state, Alice appears to be physically present but mentally unreachable, causing Mr. Pyncheon's growing concern and urgency as his attempts to awaken her fail. Her trance-like condition is beyond the ordinary and signals a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons, further adding to Mr. Pyncheon's unease." />

Alice sat in an attitude of profound repose, with the&#10;    long brown lashes drooping over her eyes.&#10;&#10;    &quot;There she is!&quot; said the carpenter.  &quot;Speak to her!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Alice! My daughter!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon.  &quot;My own Alice!&quot;&#10;&#10;    She did not stir.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Louder!&quot; said Maule, smiling.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Alice! Awake!&quot; cried her father.  &quot;It troubles me to see you thus!&#10;    Awake!&quot;&#10;&#10;    He spoke loudly, with terror in his voice, and close to that delicate&#10;    ear which had always been so sensitive to every discord.  But the sound&#10;    evidently reached her not.  It is indescribable what a sense of remote,&#10;    dim, unattainable distance betwixt himself and Alice was impressed on&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The text suggests that Colonel Pyncheon had grounds for his confident anticipation of success in the Eastern claim because he was known to be a practical man with experience in public and private business. He would not have pursued an impracticable scheme or entertained ill-founded hopes (Hawthorne, 1851).&#10;    Confidence: Strong" />
    <node id=", at the period of my&#10;    grandfather's decease.  It was well known, to those in his confidence,&#10;    that he anticipated neither difficulty nor delay.  Now, Colonel&#10;    Pyncheon, I need hardly say, was a practical man, well acquainted with&#10;    public and private business, and not at all the person to cherish&#10;    ill-founded hopes, or to attempt the following out of an impracticable&#10;    scheme.  It is obvious to conclude, therefore, that he had grounds, not&#10;    apparent to his heirs, for his confident anticipation of success in the&#10;    matter of this Eastern claim.  In a word, I believe,--and my legal&#10;    advisers coincide in the belief, which, moreover, is authorized, to a&#10;    certain extent, by the family traditions,--that my grandfather was in&#10;    possession of some deed, or other document, essential to this claim,&#10;    but which has since disappeared.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Very likely,&quot; said Matthew Maule,--and again, it is said, there was a&#10;    dark smile" />
    <node id=" the present instance.&quot;&#10;&#10;    He then renewed the conversation, and made great pecuniary offers to&#10;    the carpenter, in case the latter should give information leading to&#10;    the discovery of the lost document, and the consequent success of the&#10;    Eastern claim. For a long time Matthew Maule is said to have turned a&#10;    cold ear to these propositions. At last, however, with a strange kind&#10;    of laugh, he inquired whether Mr. Pyncheon would make over to him the&#10;    old wizard's homestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, now standing on it, in requital of the documentary evidence so&#10;    urgently required.&#10;&#10;    The wild, chimney-corner legend (which, without copying all its&#10;            extravagances, my narrative essentially follows) here gives an account&#10;    of some very strange behavior on the part of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    portrait.  This picture, it must be understood, was supposed to be so&#10;    intimately connected with the fate of" />
    <node id=" more congenial home, had not his own fortune, as well as his deceased&#10;    wife's, begun to give symptoms of exhaustion.  The Eastern claim once&#10;    fairly settled, and put upon the firm basis of actual possession, Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon's property--to be measured by miles, not acres--would be worth&#10;    an earldom, and would reasonably entitle him to solicit, or enable him&#10;    to purchase, that elevated dignity from the British monarch.  Lord&#10;    Pyncheon!--or the Earl of Waldo!--how could such a magnate be expected&#10;    to contract his grandeur within the pitiful compass of seven shingled&#10;    gables?&#10;&#10;    In short, on an enlarged view of the business, the carpenter's terms&#10;    appeared so ridiculously easy that Mr. Pyncheon could scarcely forbear&#10;    laughing in his face.  He was quite ashamed, after the foregoing&#10;    reflections, to propose any diminution of so moderate a recompense for&#10;    the immense service to be rendered.&#10;&#10;    &quot;I consent to your proposition" />
    <node id="Alice Pyncheon defiantly dismissed her fear of Matthew Maule's threat due to an unfortunate impulse, asserting what she believed was her independence and safety under her father's protection. Despite the hidden sarcasm in Maule's tone and his inexplicable strength, Alice chose to misunderstand or downplay the potential danger she might be facing by engaging with him. This decision ultimately placed her in seemingly dangerous circumstances." />
    <node id=" shall&#10;    immediately be broken off.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Mistress Alice Pyncheon,&quot; remarked Matthew Maule, with the utmost&#10;    deference, but yet a half-hidden sarcasm in his look and tone, &quot;will no&#10;    doubt feel herself quite safe in her father's presence, and under his&#10;    all-sufficient protection.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I certainly shall entertain no manner of apprehension, with my father&#10;    at hand,&quot; said Alice with maidenly dignity.  &quot;Neither do I conceive&#10;    that a lady, while true to herself, can have aught to fear from&#10;    whomsoever, or in any circumstances!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Poor Alice! By what unhappy impulse did she thus put herself at once on&#10;    terms of defiance against a strength which she could not estimate?&#10;&#10;    &quot;Then, Mistress Alice,&quot; said Matthew Maule, handing a&#10;    chair,--gracefully enough, for a craftsman, &quot;will it please you only to&#10;    sit down, and do me the favor (though altogether beyond a poor&#10;           " />
    <node id=" On recognizing Matthew Maule, she assumed an air of&#10;    somewhat cold but gentle dignity, the rather, as there was a certain&#10;    peculiar smile on the carpenter's visage that stirred the native pride&#10;    of the fair Alice.   So ended, for that time, the quest for the lost&#10;    title-deed of the Pyncheon territory at the Eastward; nor, though often&#10;    subsequently renewed, has it ever yet befallen a Pyncheon to set his&#10;    eye upon that parchment.&#10;&#10;    But, alas for the beautiful, the gentle, yet too haughty Alice!  A&#10;    power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden&#10;    soul.  A will, most unlike her own, constrained her to do its grotesque&#10;    and fantastic bidding.  Her father as it proved, had martyred his poor&#10;    child to an inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead&#10;    of acres.  And, therefore, while Alice Pyncheon lived, she was Maule's&#10;    slave, in a bondage more" />
    <node id="Elder Truth is prevented from revealing the secret contained in the parchment due to his two unidentified partners in the mystery struggling with him and pressing their hands over his mouth, which causes a fresh flow of blood on his band. This struggle might have been because the secret was too dangerous or sensitive to be revealed, or perhaps they wanted to maintain control over the information.&#10;&#10;Maule cautions Mr. Pyncheon that it will never be allowed for Truth's heirs to take custody of this secret because of the popular belief that there exists a mysterious connection and dependence between the family of the Maules and the vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons. This connection may imply that the Maule family has some sort of historical claim or influence over the Pyncheon property, which might prevent the Pyncheons from gaining full control over their estate. By warning Mr. Pyncheon about this, Matthew Maule is highlighting the complex and contentious relationship between the two families, as well as the supernatural elements at play in the story." />

Finally, when he showed a purpose&#10;    of shouting forth the secret loudly enough to be heard from his own&#10;    sphere into that of mortals, his companions struggled with him, and&#10;    pressed their hands over his mouth; and forthwith--whether that he were&#10;    choked by it, or that the secret itself was of a crimson hue--there was&#10;    a fresh flow of blood upon his band.

Now and then a&#10;   maid-servant, neatly dressed, and now the shining sable face of a&#10;   slave, might be seen bustling across the windows, in the lower part of&#10;   the house.  At an open window of a room in the second story, hanging&#10;   over some pots of beautiful and delicate flowers,--exotics, but which&#10;   had never known a more genial sunshine than that of the New England&#10;   autumn,--was the figure of a young lady, an exotic, like the flowers,&#10;   and beautiful and delicate as they.

The shadow creeps and&#10;   creeps, and is always looking over the shoulder of the sunshine!&quot;&#10;&#10;   It might have befitted a craftsman, like Matthew Maule, on being sent&#10;   for to a gentleman's house, to go to the back door, where servants and&#10;   work-people were usually admitted;" />

During this period, the&#10;   family mansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman, who was&#10;   allowed to make it his home for the time being, in consideration of&#10;   keeping the premises in thorough repair.  So faithfully had this&#10;   contract been fulfilled, that now, as the carpenter approached the&#10;   house, his practised eye could detect nothing to criticise in its&#10;   condition.  The peaks of the seven gables rose up sharply; the shingled&#10;   roof looked thoroughly water-tight; and the glittering plaster-work&#10;   entirely covered the exterior walls, and sparkled in the October sun,&#10;   as if it had been new only a week ago.&#10;&#10;   The house had that pleasant aspect of life which is like the cheery&#10;   expression of comfortable activity in the human countenance.  You could&#10;   see, at once, that there was the stir of a large family within it.

It was a wild&#10;   story, perhaps, but seemed not altogether so incredible to those who&#10;   could remember what an inflexibly obstinate old fellow this wizard&#10;   Maule had been.&#10;&#10;   Now, the wizard's grandson, the young Matthew Maule of our story, was&#10;   popularly supposed to have inherited some of his ancestor's&#10;   questionable traits.  It is wonderful how many absurdities were&#10;   promulgated in reference to the young man.  He was fabled, for example,&#10;   to have a strange power of getting into people's dreams, and regulating&#10;   matters there according to his own fancy, pretty much like the&#10;   stage-manager of a theatre.  There was a great deal of talk among the&#10;   neighbors, particularly the petticoated ones, about what they called&#10;   the witchcraft of Maule's eye.  Some" />

    <node id="Matthew Maule, the carpenter, chose to go to the main entrance of the Pyncheon house instead of the back door or side entrance for servants and work-people as an expression of his family's historical connection to the property. This decision signifies his challenge to the Pyncheons' ownership, as his grandfather originally owned the land where the Pyncheon House now stands. His prideful nature and bitterness about the Pyncheons having obtained the title-deeds to his family's property unjustly further motivate this action." />
    <node id="Yes, Mr. Pyncheon's question indeed reflects his concern for Alice's well-being and his suspicion towards Matthew Maule. The narrative has established that the community believes in Maule's wizardly heritage and the alleged curse on the Pyncheons. Given this context, it is reasonable for Mr. Pyncheon to consider whether there might be a supernatural influence at play in Alice's interaction with Maule.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Alice's entranced state, which is beyond ordinary understanding, further fuels his concern and urgency. The fact that she appears physically present but mentally unreachable suggests an unusual connection between the two families, adding to Mr. Pyncheon's unease.&#10;&#10;Therefore, considering these factors, Mr. Pyncheon's question about whether Maule's influence over Alice could be a form of witchcraft is consistent with his role as a protective father and his responsibility to ensure his daughter's safety. His decision to intervene or not despite Alice's request would depend on his assessment of the situation, balancing his respect for her will against his concerns for her well-being." />
    <node id="Yes, there were connections between the rumors about Colonel Pyncheon's death and Matthew Maule's father's activities on the day of the Colonel's passing.

According to these rumors, Matthew Maule's father might have had a role in Colonel Pyncheon's death.&#10;&#10;Mr. Pyncheon has a piece of personal evidence that supports this connection. As a child, he either remembered or imagined that Matthew's father did some job on the day before or possibly the very morning of Colonel Pyncheon's demise in the private room where he and the carpenter were talking. Mr. Pyncheon recalls that certain papers belonging to Colonel Pyncheon had been spread out on the table, which could imply that Matthew Maule's father might have been involved in some way with the disputed title-deeds or other crucial documents regarding the property ownership. This evidence lends credibility to the rumors surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's death and its potential connection to Matthew Maule's father." />

And here Mr. Pyncheon could&#10;    bring an item of his own personal evidence into play.  Though but a&#10;    child at the time, he either remembered or fancied that Matthew's&#10;    father had had some job to perform on the day before, or possibly the&#10;    very morning of the Colonel's decease, in the private room where he and&#10;    the carpenter were at this moment talking.

    <node id="The narrative suggests that an unknown and unspecified power or force has caused Alice Pyncheon to become Matthew Maule's slave. However, the text implies that this situation may have been facilitated by her father's &quot;inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead of acres,&quot; which ultimately led to his martyring of his daughter in a metaphorical or possibly even literal sense.&#10;&#10;The passage states that &quot;a power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden soul&quot; and that &quot;while Alice Pyncheon lived, she was Maule's slave.&quot; The text does not explicitly explain the nature of this power or how it relates to her father's desire for land.&#10;&#10;However, given the context of the narrative, which features a longstanding feud between the Maule and Pyncheon families and hints at supernatural elements, it is possible that Matthew Maule has somehow placed a curse on Alice or her family, compelling her to obey his will. Alternatively, this power could be an expression of the Maule family's historical connection to the land, which Matthews Maule asserts by using the main entrance of the Pyncheon house.&#10;&#10;It is also possible that the text is making a metaphorical or symbolic point about the way in which the Pyncheons' obsession with wealth and property has led to their exploitation of others, including their own family members. In this interpretation, Alice's enslavement could be seen as a consequence of her father's desire for land, which has led him to sacrifice his daughter's well-being in pursuit of his goals.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text does not provide a clear answer to this question, leaving it open to interpretation and speculation." />
    <node id="The old dignitary, Elder Truth, is prevented from revealing the secret by two unidentified partners in the mystery, who struggle with him and press their hands over his mouth, causing a fresh flow of blood on his band. This might be due to the sensitive nature of the secret or their desire to maintain control over the information. Matthew Maule plays a significant role in this situation as he cautions Mr. Pyncheon that it will never be allowed for Truth's heirs to take custody of this secret, implying a historical claim or influence of the Maule family over the Pyncheon property, which could prevent the Pyncheons from gaining full control over their estate." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the carpenter (Matthew Maule) suggests that Mr. Pyncheon cannot have custody of a secret related to their ancestors' disputes and unrealized possessions because it is intertwined with the Maule family's history and fate. The popular belief is that there exists some mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons, implying that matters concerning their shared past cannot be fully controlled or possessed by only one party, particularly the Pyncheons.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Matthew Maule proposes revealing this secret to Mr. Pyncheon's daughter Alice, further emphasizing that he does not consider Mr. Pyncheon as the sole rightful claimant of the information. The carpenter insists on sharing the secret directly with a female member of the Pyncheon family, which can be seen as an attempt to bypass or counterbalance the power dynamics between the two families.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Pyncheon cannot have custody of the secret according to Matthew Maule because the carpenter believes in the mysterious connection between their families and sees himself as having a role in determining how the information is shared with the Pyncheons." />

However, it's suggested that the Maules may have some sort of historical claim or influence over the Pyncheon property due to supernatural elements and popular beliefs. The hanged wizard, Maule's grandfather, is believed to have gained the better end of his contest with Colonel Pyncheon because, despite being hanged for witchcraft, his family allegedly continues to have a stake in or control over the Pyncheon estate.&#10;&#10;This connection is supported by various rumors and incidents mentioned in the narrative:&#10;&#10;1. The popular belief that there exists a mysterious connection and dependence between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions, which might prevent the Pyncheons from gaining full control over their estate.&#10;2.

The belief that the right hand of the skeleton of Maule's grandfather was unaccountably missing after a secret search caused by the community.&#10;&#10;These clues point to some sort of supernatural claim or influence that the Maule family has over the Pyncheon estate, which has prevented the Pyncheons from fully realizing their possessions.

    <node id="Alice's faint exclamation is a call for help that reaches her father's conscience.

Upon hearing his daughter's call, Mr. Pyncheon experiences intense emotions as his heart registers it as a &quot;dismal shriek&quot; and creates a deep sense of concern and urgency for her well-being. This moment emphasizes the father's protective instincts and highlights the threatening atmosphere surrounding Alice due to Maule's presence.&#10;&#10;Mr. Pyncheon's reaction to his daughter's faint exclamation further demonstrates their close bond, her vulnerability in this situation, and his growing suspicion of Matthew Maule's intentions and influence over Alice. The fact that Mr. Pyncheon doesn't immediately respond or turn around upon hearing his daughter's cry could be due to his preoccupation with the customary courtesies when ushering in Matthew Maule or his reluctance to accept the supernatural elements at play.

This traumatic experience created an unsettling feeling about the house for Gervayse.&#10;&#10;As an adult, after marrying a lady of fortune, Gervayse spent many years in England and various cities on the European continent.

Additionally, the sundial has kept time accurately for the past 33 years since Colonel Pyncheon's demise, emphasizing the house's age and its association with the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions.

The purpose of Mr. Pyncheon's summons for Matthew Maule is to discuss a proposition about giving up his house, which used to belong to the carpenter's family before the Pyncheons obtained the title-deeds through questionable means.&#10;   &#10;2. Matthew Maule's lineage relates to the building of the house and the dispute over the property's ownership because his grandfather originally owned the land where the Pyncheon House now stands. He built his own cottage there, establishing the Maule family's historical connection to the property. By going to the main entrance instead of the back door or side entrance for servants and work-people, Matthew asserts his rightful claim to the land and challenges the Pyncheons' ownership." />
    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon allows Matthew Maule's experiment with the Claude mirror, even though he has reservations, due to his ambition for his daughter Alice.

He consents to the experiment mainly for her sake and envisions a rich dowry to go along with this elevated match.

This bondage was due to her father's relentless pursuit of measuring his land by miles instead of acres, effectively martyring Alice to his desire for the Pyncheon territory at the Eastward. The exact nature of Maule's control over Alice is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it seems to involve some sort of supernatural influence that stems from their families' interconnected histories and the alleged curse on the Pyncheons." />

Instead, it is her father's obsession with land and his willingness to sacrifice his daughter's well-being for his own ambition that ultimately leads to her enslavement. The lost title-deed is unrelated to this bondage, but the text may be implying a broader connection between the Pyncheons' obsession with wealth and property and their exploitation of others, including their own family members.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Alice's enslavement does not prevent her from finding the title-deed, it is emblematic of the larger systemic issues within the Pyncheon family that have led to their downfall. The fact that they have lost the title-deed and are unable to find it is a symptom of these deeper issues, rather than the cause of Alice's bondage.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text does not provide clear answers about the nature of the power and bondage that Alice Pyncheon is subjected to, it seems to be related to Matthew Maule's supernatural influence over her. This bondage is a consequence of her father's obsession with land and his willingness to sacrifice his daughter's well-being for his own ambition, and it is emblematic of the larger systemic issues within the Pyncheon family that have led to their downfall. The lost title-deed is unrelated to this bondage but may be connected to these broader issues in more subtle ways." />

Specifically, she enjoys working on a &quot;tapestried pincushion&quot; as her latest project (Hawthorne, 1851).

This traumatic experience created an unsettling feeling about the house for Gervayse.&#10;&#10;As an adult, after marrying a lady of fortune, Gervayse spent many years in England and various cities on the European continent. His time abroad led him to look down upon the House of the Seven Gables, seeing it as inferior in splendor and convenience compared to the castles, ancestral halls, and marble palaces he had become familiar with during his travels.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Gervayse recognized that the house was not suitable for the lifestyle he intended to maintain after realizing his territorial rights and acquiring wealth from his inherited land. The house was inadequate to support the status appropriate for a man of his expected wealth and social position. Thus, Gervayse initially planned to return to England had his fortune not begun to show signs of exhaustion, forcing him to deal with the House of the Seven Gables and the Pyncheon family legacy.">

    <edge source="The narrative suggests that an unknown and unspecified power or force has caused Alice Pyncheon to become Matthew Maule's slave. However, the text implies that this situation may have been facilitated by her father's &quot;inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead of acres,&quot; which ultimately led to his martyring of his daughter in a metaphorical or possibly even literal sense.&#10;&#10;The passage states that &quot;a power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden soul&quot; and that &quot;while Alice Pyncheon lived, she was Maule's slave.&quot; The text does not explicitly explain the nature of this power or how it relates to her father's desire for land.&#10;&#10;However, given the context of the narrative, which features a longstanding feud between the Maule and Pyncheon families and hints at supernatural elements, it is possible that Matthew Maule has somehow placed a curse on Alice or her family, compelling her to obey his will. Alternatively, this power could be an expression of the Maule family's historical connection to the land, which Matthews Maule asserts by using the main entrance of the Pyncheon house.&#10;&#10;It is also possible that the text is making a metaphorical or symbolic point about the way in which the Pyncheons' obsession with wealth and property has led to their exploitation of others, including their own family members. In this interpretation, Alice's enslavement could be seen as a consequence of her father's desire for land, which has led him to sacrifice his daughter's well-being in pursuit of his goals.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text does not provide a clear answer to this question, leaving it open to interpretation and speculation." target="Alice Pyncheon is subjected to a supernatural bondage and becomes Matthew Maule's slave due to her father's &quot;inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead of acres.&quot; The text does not provide explicit details about how this bondage works, but it seems that Matthew Maule has some sort of supernatural influence over her, compelling her to do his bidding in a grotesque and fantastic manner.&#10;&#10;This bondage does not directly prevent Alice from finding the lost title-deed of the Pyncheon territory. Instead, it is her father's obsession with land and his willingness to sacrifice his daughter's well-being for his own ambition that ultimately leads to her enslavement. The lost title-deed is unrelated to this bondage, but the text may be implying a broader connection between the Pyncheons' obsession with wealth and property and their exploitation of others, including their own family members.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Alice's enslavement does not prevent her from finding the title-deed, it is emblematic of the larger systemic issues within the Pyncheon family that have led to their downfall. The fact that they have lost the title-deed and are unable to find it is a symptom of these deeper issues, rather than the cause of Alice's bondage.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text does not provide clear answers about the nature of the power and bondage that Alice Pyncheon is subjected to, it seems to be related to Matthew Maule's supernatural influence over her. This bondage is a consequence of her father's obsession with land and his willingness to sacrifice his daughter's well-being for his own ambition, and it is emblematic of the larger systemic issues within the Pyncheon family that have led to their downfall. The lost title-deed is unrelated to this bondage but may be connected to these broader issues in more subtle ways.">

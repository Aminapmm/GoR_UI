    <node id=" for various weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone. Garrett's men had searched carefully.&#10; &#10; Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from physical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That was most important right now. But other things were bothering him, tugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each trying to shove it in a different direction.&#10; &#10; There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind first. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression that he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.&#10; &#10; Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had called her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving that the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!&#10; &#10; Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed, and he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like that. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as a &quot;wolf's-head&quot; pirate. The girl would be watching, and" />
    <node id=", &quot;Drop those weapons, or I'll blast you ... pirate !&quot;&#10; &#10; Death Star said, &quot;That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the magazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.&quot;&#10; &#10; The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a half-gasp. &quot;Starrett Blade! I—I don't believe ...&quot; she broke off abruptly. &quot;So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a pirate.&quot;&#10; &#10; Star reddened. &quot;Look,&quot; he snapped, &quot;I don't know who's been talking to you, but ...&quot; he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his belt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and flung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side, and paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him to land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily cursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl, so that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered why it had seemed" />
    <node id=" his hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the universally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.&#10; &#10; Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.&#10; &#10; The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained to her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or have executed, by anyone. Which was very true.&#10; &#10; A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star felt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If the image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in—Garrett would undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed Starrett Blade—then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in time to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo over the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let the girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want that. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.&#10; &#10; Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It was not a Hineson Sub" />

It was not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter which had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger units in it.&#10; &#10; The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus the girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's death. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily that he could have the chance to interfere.&#10; &#10; The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen change, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander Weddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips move—then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun in his hand....&#10; &#10; The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an expression of shocked surprise on his face—surprise, Blade thought desperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil Garrett.&#10; &#10; Which was right, in a way.&#10; &#10; Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as" />

For a month!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A month? Huh—please—you...?&quot;&#10; &#10; Star took a breath, and started over. &quot;You.... Who are you? What are you doing here?&quot;&#10; &#10; She said, &quot;I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you heard of him?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course!&quot; said Star. &quot;He manufactures most of the equipment ' Blade Cosmian ' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ... the ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I should have recognized the name. But go on.

Then Anne broke the silence with, &quot;Star, what are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little while. We can't get to a sub-space beam.

The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device fixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller than an old-style fountain pen.&#10; &#10; He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever before. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness of his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one instant.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; And Devil Garrett died.&#10; &#10; There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white fire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire from Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into Garrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as his muscles started the jerking movement.&#10; &#10; And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.&#10; &#10; Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and swore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt.

He stood there, not staring, just looking at Garrett.&#10; &#10; The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and twice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and a set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting on a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his great weight.&#10; &#10; He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,&#10;&quot;Ah, Mr. Garrett.&quot;&#10; &#10; Star's jaw dropped. &quot;Garrett? What do you—&quot; he broke off. A glance at the girl told him what the purpose was.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,&quot; said the pirate, still smiling softly, &quot;Miss Hinton is aware of your identity.

As the other leaped forward, swinging a clubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and ducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder up under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp blows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand leaped toward that &quot;ace card&quot; which he still held.&#10; &#10; Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous bow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the electron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.&#10; &#10; Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent, walked over and out, at the point of the weapon.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.&#10; &#10; He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in his hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the universally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.&#10; " />

After a minute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said mockingly, &quot;Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?&quot;&#10; &#10; Star said, in a low, cold voice, &quot;I'm thinking of putting an electron fire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!&quot;&#10; &#10; Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a person who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped forward, shaking with rage.&#10; &#10; &quot;You beast! Murderer!

Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and someone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the door told him that he was to be executed, &quot;... after Mr. Blade and the lady have eaten.&quot; Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a mocking &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!&quot;&#10; &#10; Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze left in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for various weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.

This signal beam is automatically released when the unit is broken and the location of the set that sent out the signal is recorded at the Section Headquarters. The signal beam cannot be used to send messages, but serves only as a means of calling for help. In this story, Commander Weddel saw Starrett Blade throw something at the set, which caused the set to go dead and triggered the distress signal.

Anne spun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the corridor.&#10; &#10; &quot;Very simple,&quot; said Star across the lounge to Anne. &quot;When I smashed the vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is included in all sets.

And there by the giant engines, those must be turbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just under the platforms on which they stood.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Star Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It could be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.&#10; &#10; The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. &quot;Well?&quot;&#10; &#10; Garrett smiled his mocking grin. &quot;You grasp the principle, of course. But let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines after the wheels?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. They carry the gases off.

When Commander Weddel saw me throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the automatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from a location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity cruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.&quot; He stopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. &quot;See these papers?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Uh-huh. What are they, Star?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're the one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the barren, rocky Centauri planets to life!&quot;&#10; &#10; He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and up through the plastic port. &quot;The planets of Centauri!&quot; he murmured softly. &quot;Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky, level except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be the life of Centauri!&quot;&#10; &#10;" />

But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a certain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for the large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.&#10; &#10; Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can curse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric flame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.&#10; &#10; It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him time to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him. One of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's head, and for the third time, he went very limp.

The sound of her voice made him come around swiftly, and he saw that she was real and not a dream.&#10;&#10;Anne supported him as he reeled and fell against the wall, showing compassion towards him. After a while, Star felt better and managed to stand up with her help. Anne explained that she now knew he was Star Blade, not Garrett, who had deceived her into believing he was Star Blade.

He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck him. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and unconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the girl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This was the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not getting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.&#10; &#10; Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door. He wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided that he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly heard the door being opened.&#10; &#10; But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly, despite his head.&#10; &#10; It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain, he could see that she was not a dream.

Through a twisting haze, he peered up at the girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of—with no other phrase to do—compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head on the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.&#10; &#10; In a minute or two, she said tensely, &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Star looked up at her.&#10; &#10; &quot;I guess so.

Therefore, he decides to ambush one of Garrett's men instead, hoping to gather information about Garrett's whereabouts or plans.

For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on a tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's ship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.&#10; &#10; That Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts of power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an atomics plant on Alpha III—if he had, escaping rays would point it out, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power, for there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal power was out, for Alpha III had no moon.&#10; &#10; However, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his water-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as a man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.&#10; &#10; It wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing.

However, it is mentioned that he intended to use this technology to power a cyclotron, which could make even the barren planets of Alpha suitable for colonization. This would be beneficial for Garrett as he could exploit these resources without facing competition from other pirates or authorities, who might be attracted by stray radiation from atomic power sources. It is also possible that he planned to use this technology as a bargaining chip with the authorities, either to avoid capture or to secure his position as a powerful figure in the void." />

He has a new—or maybe it isn't so new—way of electrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I think I understand,&quot; said Star quickly. &quot;When the oxygen and hydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive a turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and even the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; she shook her head puzzledly. &quot;It's just electric power. He said that atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know,&quot; Star nodded, abstractedly. &quot;I was thinking of another application of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that he wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had another plan behind it. Got any idea?&quot;&#10; &#10; Anne shook her head slowly. &quot;I don't know.

    <node id="The confrontation between Star and Devil Garrett results in Devil Garrett's death. Star's quick reflexes and his use of a jet weapon play a crucial role in the outcome. When Garrett threatens Star with his gun, Star quickly uses his jet weapon to shoot first, hitting Garrett's vitals and causing him to convulse and fire his weapon. However, Star is able to move quickly enough to avoid the flame from Garrett's gun, which goes over his head and singes his scalp.&#10;&#10;After killing Garrett, Star fights off four of Garrett's men who were present. His quick reflexes and combat skills allow him to disarm and defeat them, despite being outnumbered. This further highlights the importance of Star's quick reflexes and weapons in the encounter.&#10;&#10;Overall, Star's quick reflexes and his use of a jet weapon prove to be decisive factors in his confrontation with Devil Garrett, allowing him to emerge victorious in the face of a significant threat." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, it is revealed that Devil Garrett has been secretly developing a new way of electrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen. This technology is used to power a cyclotron, which could make even the barren planets of Alpha suitable for colonization. It is suggested that Garrett plans to exploit these resources without facing competition from other pirates or authorities.&#10;&#10;Regarding the Barden energy-beam that stabbed up at Blade's ship, it can be inferred that Garrett has been using this technology for his advantage. Although the specifics of how Garrett obtained a Barden energy-beam without a conventional power source are not provided, it is possible that he used his new electrolysis process to power it. This would explain how the beam was able to stab up at Blade's ship despite the absence of conventional power sources on Alpha III.&#10;&#10;In this situation, one of Garrett's heavily armed men plays a role in that Star Blade is currently unarmed and outnumbered. As Star has been hunting Garrett for a year and is familiar with his methods, he suspects that Garrett is not on Alpha III. Therefore, Star decides to ambush one of Garrett's men instead, hoping to gather information about Garrett's whereabouts or plans. However, this plan backfires when Star is confronted by Devil Garrett himself and disarmed." />

After Anne stabs one of the men and Star disarms another, two of the remaining men flee into a room filled with instruments and recording devices.

However, it is unclear what specifically happens next, as the story ends shortly after this exchange.

However, it's also mentioned that Death Star has quick reflexes, so he might have been able to react in time to avoid getting hit directly, but still receive injuries from the blast. Additionally, Death Star himself was about to shoot the girl when she threw her own jet-gun at him, which distracted him and allowed one of Garrett's men to strike him, leading to his capture." />

    <node id="When the direction finder unit of a liner-beam vision set is broken, it releases an automatic distress signal in the form of a signal beam. This signal cannot be used to send messages but serves only as a means of calling for help. The location of the set that sent out the signal is recorded at the Section Headquarters. In this story, Commander Weddel saw Starrett Blade throw something at the set, which caused it to go dead and triggered the distress signal. He then had a high-velocity cruiser brought out to pick up any remaining pieces." />
    <node id="1. The distress signal from Alpha Cen's third planet is significant because it reveals that Star Blade has arrived on the planet. This information is useful to Commander Weddel and the Section Headquarters as they can now send a high-velocity cruiser to pick up Star Blade.&#10;2. Devil Garrett's power plant plans relate to the barren, rocky planets of Centauri because they describe a new way of electrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen. This technology is used to power a cyclotron, which can make even the barren planets of Alpha suitable for colonization by creating an atmosphere through the release of hydrogen and oxygen. It is suggested that Garrett plans to exploit these resources without facing competition from other pirates or authorities.&#10;3. The fact that Devil Garrett has been using a Barden energy-beam on Alpha III, which stabbed up at Star Blade's ship, further supports the idea that he has been using this new electrolysis process to power it. This would explain how the beam was able to function without any conventional power sources on Alpha III." />

Anne expressed her excitement about the prospect of the transformed planet, saying that it wouldn't be ready for six months, but it would have to do for their honeymoon plans.

    <node id="The transmitter in question is not specifically named as a particular type, but its nature has a significant impact on Starrett Blade's hope of survival. It is a two-way transmitter, meaning it can both send and receive transmissions. When Star sees that the image of an Interstellar Command headquarters is tuned in, he hopes that if Garrett kills him and cuts the beam too quickly, one of the police might give a cry that would echo over the sub-space beam and alert Anne that she has been tricked. However, Star realizes that the transmitter is not a Hineson Sub beam, which can only send messages in space due to the diffusing effect of unrestricted cosmic rays. Instead, this transmitter includes a little unit with a type of beam that cosmics cannot disturb. If the direction finder unit of the vision set is broken (which it was when Star smashed the set), it releases an automatic distress signal in the form of a signal beam, which is recorded at Section Headquarters. This realization ultimately leads to Commander Weddel appearing and rescuing Starrett Blade, ensuring his survival." />

This would be beneficial for Garrett as he could exploit these resources without facing competition from other pirates or authorities, who might be attracted by stray radiation from atomic power sources. It is also possible that he planned to use this technology as a bargaining chip with the authorities, either to avoid capture or to secure his position as a powerful figure in the void.">

It is a two-way transmitter, meaning it can both send and receive transmissions. When Star sees that the image of an Interstellar Command headquarters is tuned in, he hopes that if Garrett kills him and cuts the beam too quickly, one of the police might give a cry that would echo over the sub-space beam and alert Anne that she has been tricked. However, Star realizes that the transmitter is not a Hineson Sub beam, which can only send messages in space due to the diffusing effect of unrestricted cosmic rays. Instead, this transmitter includes a little unit with a type of beam that cosmics cannot disturb. If the direction finder unit of the vision set is broken (which it was when Star smashed the set), it releases an automatic distress signal in the form of a signal beam, which is recorded at Section Headquarters. This realization ultimately leads to Commander Weddel appearing and rescuing Starrett Blade, ensuring his survival.">

However, Star realizes that the transmitter is not a Hineson Sub beam, which can only send messages in space due to the diffusing effect of unrestricted cosmic rays. Instead, this transmitter includes a little unit with a type of beam that cosmics cannot disturb. If the direction finder unit of the vision set is broken (which it was when Star smashed the set), it releases an automatic distress signal in the form of a signal beam, which is recorded at Section Headquarters.

Moreover, when Star started to step forward after Anne gestured towards Garrett, he was disarmed and outnumbered, which made it difficult for him to confront Garrett directly.">

    <edge source="1. After being knocked out by one of Garrett's men, Starrett wakes up in a cell. His weapons have been taken away, indicating that Garrett's men had searched and disarmed him thoroughly.&#10;2. He learns from a man stationed outside his cell that he is to be executed after Garrett and Anne Hinton have eaten, revealing Garrett's plan to execute Starrett as a form of public spectacle and to claim the reward on his head.&#10;3. Starrett does not panic but instead sits down and waits for his opportunity. The fact that he remains calm despite the dire circumstances further underscores his reputation as &quot;Death Star&quot; Blade.&#10;4. Later, Garrett confirms Starrett's execution through an old-style transmitter beam, potentially affecting Anne Hinton's interpretation of events since the visual image arrives before the sound.&#10;5. Realizing that he is outnumbered and unarmed, Starrett decides to ambush one of Garrett's men instead of confronting Garrett directly, likely due to his suspicion that Garrett is not on Alpha III at all. The story ends with this cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering about Starrett's fate." target="1. The transmitter in question is a two-way transmitter with a specific type of beam that is not susceptible to the diffusing effect of unrestricted cosmic rays. This feature allows it to send and receive transmissions, as well as automatically release a distress signal if its direction finder unit is broken.&#10;2. The functionality of this transmitter significantly impacts Starrett Blade's hope of survival in two ways:&#10;   a. When Star realizes the transmitter is not a Hineson Sub beam, which can only send messages in space due to cosmic rays, he understands that if Garrett kills him and cuts the beam too quickly, one of the police might still give a cry that would echo over the sub-space beam and alert Anne that she has been tricked.&#10;   b. When Star smashes the transmitter during his escape attempt, it releases an automatic distress signal in the form of a signal beam, which is recorded at Section Headquarters. This action leads to Commander Weddel appearing and rescuing Starrett Blade, ensuring his survival.">

    <edge source="The famous killer in the void that Star encounters is Devil Garrett. He is six feet three inches tall, twice as strong as he looks, and known for his cruelty and danger. He carries a high-velocity jet-gun and electron knives, and his chair bends under his great weight. When he smiles, there is a touch of hell in it. He has been aware of Star's true identity since firing a beam at his ship and plans to execute him before a stellar vision screen connected with Section Void Headquarters to collect the reward offered on him." target="The famous killer in the void that Star meets is Devil Garrett.

    <node id="1. The sermon chosen for Thias's funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance, as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine, the vicar, speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them that the present moment is all they can call their own for works of mercy, righteous dealing, and family tenderness. These are old truths, but they become the most startling to people in the week when they have looked on the dead face of someone who has made a part of their lives (Eliot 301). The sermon encourages the congregation to remember the importance of living righteously and cherishing their family ties.&#10;2. As for the words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; they affect the attendees deeply as they blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation (Eliot 301). The peaceful atmosphere created by the sunshine and the quiet rising of the congregation after the service enhances the solemnity of the moment. The words, often associated with religious worship and comfort, provide a sense of solace in their familiarity and create a calming effect on those who hear them during this time of mourning. The peace of God transcends understanding, offering a form of comfort that doesn't necessarily require complete comprehension, making it accessible to all in attendance, regardless of their ability to read or comprehend the service fully." />
    <node id=" and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm&#10;was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger&#10;emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference&#10;to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, &quot;In the&#10;midst of life we are in death&quot;--how the present moment is all we can&#10;call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family&#10;tenderness. All very old truths--but what we thought the oldest truth&#10;becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the&#10;dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want&#10;to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do&#10;they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure&#10;its intensity by remembering the former dimness?&#10;&#10;Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime&#10;words, &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; seemed to&#10;blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of" />
    <node id="end with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the&#10;fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the&#10;old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk,&#10;their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday&#10;every one was ready to receive a guest--it was the day when all must be&#10;in their best clothes and their best humour.&#10;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were&#10;waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without&#10;saying a kind word to the widow and her sons.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Mrs. Bede,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, &quot;you&#10;must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they've&#10;lived to rear their children and see one another's hair grey.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they wonna have long to wait for one&#10;another then, anyhow" />
    <node id=" not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang.&#10;The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words--&#10;&#10;     Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;&#10;     We vanish hence like dreams--&#10;&#10;seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor&#10;Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.&#10;Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it&#10;was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater&#10;wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days&#10;while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the&#10;more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor&#10;Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of&#10;faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and&#10;tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father's death,&#10;all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of" />
    <node id="beth had turned round to look&#10;again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth&#10;under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any&#10;day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed&#10;an unusual sense of her own importance in having a &quot;burial,&quot; and in Mr.&#10;Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she&#10;knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this&#10;counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with&#10;her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods&#10;of their fellow-parishioners.&#10;&#10;The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the&#10;loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr.&#10;Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps&#10;helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.&#10;&#10;But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now" />
    <node id=" while his family passed into the&#10;church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of&#10;the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude--that is to say,&#10;with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his&#10;waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very&#10;much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a&#10;mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience&#10;discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with&#10;old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward,&#10;coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that&#10;could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than&#10;usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading&#10;the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word&#10;of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of&#10;their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who&#10;played the part of steward so" />
    <node id="' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under&#10;their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow,&#10;folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held&#10;books--why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a&#10;few &quot;good words&quot; by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved&#10;silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension&#10;indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and&#10;bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing&#10;up--the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey&#10;pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of&#10;those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of&#10;rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of&#10;Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in&#10;his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother&#10;and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent&#10;too--all the more agreeable for" />
    <node id="In the given narrative, Grandfather's instruction to &quot;mind what the parson says&quot; is his way of reminding the children to pay attention to the sermon and behave properly in church. This is a common admonition given by elders to young children before attending religious services.&#10;&#10;The interaction between Grandfather and Totty, where she asks him for a peppermint and shows him her necklace, further highlights the affectionate relationship between them. The author describes Totty as a &quot;deep little wench,&quot; suggesting that she is clever and manipulative in her own innocent way, using her charm to get what she wants. Grandfather, amused by her antics, gives in to her request for a peppermint, showing his fondness for his granddaughter.&#10;&#10;These interactions before leaving for church also serve to establish the setting and atmosphere of the story, which takes place in a small farming community where people know each other well and have close-knit relationships. The scene sets the stage for the family's attendance at church, which plays a significant role in their lives and in the narrative as a whole." />
    <node id=" what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,&quot; said&#10;Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of&#10;a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling,&#10;a little, secretly, during the sermon.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dood-bye, Dandad,&quot; said Totty. &quot;Me doin' to church. Me dot my neklace&#10;on. Dive me a peppermint.&quot;&#10;&#10;Grandad, shaking with laughter at this &quot;deep little wench,&quot; slowly&#10;transferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and&#10;slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had&#10;fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation.&#10;&#10;And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again,&#10;watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the&#10;far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge.

Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if&#10;they don't make haste and go on to church.&quot;&#10;&#10;This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two&#10;remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any&#10;serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,&#10;alias &quot;bullheads,&quot; which the lads looked at wistfully.&#10;&#10;The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was&#10;not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had&#10;often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but" />

And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this&#10;afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now&#10;the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the&#10;horizon.&#10;&#10;You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the&#10;farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning&#10;subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would&#10;have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed&#10;to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on&#10;the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together&#10;with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow&#10;stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an&#10;excellent" />

If ever a girl looked as if she had been made&#10;of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock.

Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face,&#10;which was good humour itself as he said, &quot;Come, Hetty--come, little&#10;uns!&quot; and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway&#10;gate into the yard.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven,&#10;in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy&#10;cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small&#10;elephant is like a very large one.

    <node id="In the given text, religious ceremonies and leisure are depicted as important aspects of life for elderly individuals, particularly Martin Poyser. The passage mentions that Martin, who is 75 years old, enjoys standing at the yard-gate to watch his family down the field during a religious procession. His wife, Mrs. Poyser, attributes this behavior to older people being satisfied with looking at things and suggests that it may be God's way of quieting them before they go to sleep.&#10;&#10;Martin's actions also demonstrate the role of leisure for elderly individuals. He takes pleasure in doing small bits of work, such as holding the gate open, because he likes to feel useful and believes that his presence contributes to a better crop and better-milked cows. On Sundays, Martin refuses to do any fieldwork, even during hay and corn harvest, due to his belief that working on sacred days is a wicked thing that will not lead to prosperity.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights the importance of religious ceremonies in the community as well. The congregation attends church together, and after the service, they engage in neighborly talk, simple civilities, and invitations to tea. Sunday is depicted as a day when everyone is ready to receive guests, regardless of personal likes and dislikes.&#10;&#10;In summary, religious ceremonies and leisure are portrayed as essential components of life for elderly individuals like Martin Poyser. They offer opportunities for social engagement and provide a sense of purpose and usefulness, even in old age. The passage also underscores the importance of religious ceremonies in fostering community cohesion and fellowship." />
    <node id=" religious ceremonies,&#10;like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had&#10;leisure.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,&quot; said Martin Poyser. &quot;I&#10;reckon he wants to watch us down the field.

    <node id=" cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had&#10;often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no&#10;temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however&#10;early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a&#10;pair of oxen &quot;sweltered&quot; while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That was&#10;a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with&#10;wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have&#10;nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.&#10;&#10;&quot;It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines&#10;so,&quot; he observed, as they passed through the &quot;Big Meadow.&quot; &quot;But it's&#10;poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience.&#10;There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,'&#10;used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to&#10;right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil.

Him and th' old&#10;squire fit one another like frost and flowers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation,&#10;but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the&#10;turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say &quot;good-bye.&quot;&#10;The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if&#10;he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly&#10;seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not&#10;to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes&#10;must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had&#10;" />

Mrs. Poyser&#10;was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any&#10;mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she&#10;turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,&#10;followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some&#10;one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she&#10;trod on.&#10;&#10;And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit&#10;of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having&#10;a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that&#10;promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a&#10;yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted&#10;by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg.

    <node id="Hetty is preoccupied with the thought that Arthur Donnithorne will soon be coming into church. She becomes anxious when she hears the church door swinging because she expects it to be Arthur, and her heart beats so that she dare not look up. However, it turns out to be only old Mr. Donnithorne and Miss Lydia passing by, which causes her a chill disappointment. The reason for her anxiety is that she has not seen him since their parting in the wood on Thursday evening, and she was looking forward to meeting him again." />
    <node id=" eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible&#10;not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But&#10;Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances--she was absorbed&#10;in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church,&#10;for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She&#10;had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday&#10;evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just&#10;the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then&#10;had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When&#10;she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not&#10;look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself.&#10;That must be old Mr. Donnithorne--he always came first, the wrinkled&#10;small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing&#10;and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia" />

But there were no more curtsies--no, he was not come;&#10;she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the&#10;house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat&#10;that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the&#10;butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now--she&#10;might be mistaken--for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted&#10;up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the&#10;chancel--there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles&#10;with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged&#10;prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt&#10;herself" />

Hetty was not&#10;without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about&#10;her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white&#10;hot-house plant, with a very long name--a Scotch name, she supposed,&#10;since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the&#10;opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of&#10;him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression&#10;on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her&#10;secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church.

    <node id="1. Dinah felt called to help the sick woman as part of her religious duties as a Methodist. This is indicated when Mrs. Poyser mentions that Dinah went &quot;again' the Scriptur', for that says, 'Love your neighbour as yourself'.&quot;&#10;   &#10;2. Dinah was not tempted by the comfortable lifestyle at the Poysers'. The text states, &quot;it 'ud niver ha' been missed.

Additionally, Mr. Poyser suggests that Dinah's departure might be due to the different appeal men have towards her as opposed to Hetty, noting &quot;The men 'ud niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Dinah decided to prioritize helping a sick woman in need and stay true to her religious beliefs, despite Mrs. Poyser's attempts to convince her to stay." />

    <node id="The solemn minor strain of the choir's singing, which was the funeral psalm, had a strong emotional impact on Lisbeth and Seth. As they listened to the familiar tunes that were full of wails, the words of the psalms seemed to apply specifically to the recent death of their husband and father.&#10;&#10;Lisbeth, the mother, felt that the psalm was doing her husband good, as it was part of a decent burial that she believed would ensure his safety in some other world. She held on to the blind belief that human love and pity are grounds for faith in divine love. The sermon, too, spoke of the importance of works of mercy, righteous dealing, and family tenderness, which resonated with Lisbeth as she mourned her husband's death.&#10;&#10;Seth, the more emotional son, was easily touched by the singing and shed tears. He tried to recall all that he had heard about the possibility of a single moment leading to salvation, as he had been doing since his father's death. The solemn minor strain of the choir's singing reminded him of his own grievances against Satchell, but he held back from talking about it for fear of being overheard by Satchell himself.&#10;&#10;Overall, the solemn minor strain of the funeral psalm served as a reminder to Lisbeth and Seth of their loss, while also offering them comfort in their grief. The singing helped them focus on the importance of leading a righteous life, filled with family tenderness, which were values that Thias Bede, their husband and father, had held dear." />
    <node id=" they had got upon the nearer subject of&#10;their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who&#10;played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr.&#10;Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive&#10;his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of&#10;conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell&#10;himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door.&#10;And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased,&#10;and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the&#10;church.&#10;&#10;They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine&#10;passed.

Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an&#10;old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death--not in his&#10;bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant--and&#10;now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.&#10;Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse.

    <node id="1. The supportive presence of fellow parishioners: Beth feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures. This creates a collective mourning atmosphere that helps ease her immediate grief.&#10;2. The beginning of the evening hymn: As the sound of the bassoon and key-bugles burst forth, marking the start of the service with the evening hymn, Beth is reminded of the comforting ritual of communal worship. This solemn moment likely provides her with a sense of stability and familiarity, further reducing the intensity of her grief.&#10;3. The focus on her husband's &quot;burial&quot; and the special service: Being part of a formal burial and having Mr. Irwine read a special service for her husband gives Beth a sense of accomplishment and importance. She takes pride in providing her husband with a proper send-off, which helps shift her focus from her personal sorrow to the significance of the ritual itself.&#10;4. Anticipation of the funeral psalm: Knowing that the funeral psalm will be sung for her husband gives Beth additional comfort and solace. She associates this tradition with a decent burial and believes it contributes to her husband's well-being in some other world, further reducing her feelings of sadness.&#10;5. The choice of sermon: Mr. Irwine's sermon focuses on the importance of living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting. This message resonates with Beth and likely offers her a sense of comfort, making her feel more connected to her community and less consumed by grief." />

    <node id="The interior of Hayslope Church is described as having grey age worn oaken pews, with no modern galleries present. The choir, including Joshua Rann, has two narrow pews to themselves on the right-hand side, and the pulpit and desk are also grey and old.

Despite its shabby appearance, the grey pews and buff-washed walls create a pleasing tone that complements the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats of the parishioners.&#10;&#10;The church interior is further warmed by liberal touches of crimson cloth. The pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew have handsome crimson cushioned cloth, and an embroidered crimson altar-cloth adorns the chancel, which was embroidered by Miss Lydia's own hand.&#10;&#10;The congregation is described as simple, consisting of hardy old men with bent knees and shoulders but still vigorous for their age, tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of stone-cutters and carpenters, well-to-do farmers with apple-cheeked families, clean old women, mostly farm laborer's wives, and Mr. Donnithorne and Miss Lydia in their fashionable attire.&#10;&#10;Hetty is particularly preoccupied with the thought of seeing Arthur Donnithorne again, who she has not seen since Thursday evening in the wood.

He might have been thinking about all the hard work and earnings he had spent on his father, but his main focus was on what his father's feelings might have been at their parting.

Why is this sorrow different from the troubles he experienced in the past?&#10;&#10;This sorrow is different from the troubles Adam experienced in the past because it stems from the finality of losing his father, who was a significant source of trouble and vexation in his life. Unlike previous hardships that Adam faced, this grief is irreversible, and he can no longer make amends or express his feelings to his father. This sorrow serves as a reminder for Adam to lead a righteous life filled with family tenderness, reflecting the values held by his father." />

Adam had&#10;never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of&#10;trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first&#10;sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow&#10;because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever&#10;gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's&#10;hand before their parting, and say, &quot;Father, you know it was all right&#10;between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive&#10;me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!&quot; Adam thought but&#10;little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his&#10;father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had&#10;been in" />

This is discussed toward the end of the excerpt, where Mrs. Poyser asks him to come as soon as he can to fix it.&#10;&#10;2. Mr. Hall's absence is mentioned in passing during the conversation between Dinah and Mrs. Poyser, but his purpose for going away is not directly linked to Mr. Craig's visit. From the dialogue, we learn that Mr. Hall went to Eagledale for a bit of fishing and would return before many days were over. This information is shared by Mrs. Poyser when Dinah expresses concern about not knowing where Mr. Hall was during church. It can be inferred that Mr. Hall's absence was unexpected, as evidenced by the conversation, but it does not directly relate to Mr. Craig's visit or tasks at the farm." />
    <node id="&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;knew his business&quot;&#10;and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was&#10;less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in&#10;confidence to her husband, &quot;You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my&#10;part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose&#10;to hear him crow.&quot; For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener,&#10;and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He&#10;had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward&#10;a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I&#10;think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch,&#10;and not his &quot;bringing up&quot;; for except that he had a stronger burr in&#10;his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people&#10;about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Mr. Poyser,&quot; he" />
    <node id=" she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she&#10;cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be&#10;given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond&#10;of giving information.&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were&#10;received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits&#10;is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of&#10;us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble&#10;understanding--it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,&#10;Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth&#10;year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and&#10;bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little&#10;heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty&#10;that the &quot;lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse&quot;; but on&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;k" />
    <node id="1. Eye color: Hetty has coloured eyes, while Mrs. Poyser mentions that she doesn't remember any blue eyes in her family; her mother had black eyes like Hetty's.&#10;2. Hair color: Dinah is described as having light hair, which can be attractive.&#10;3. Complexion: If Dinah had a bit of color in her cheeks and didn't wear her Methodist cap, folks would think her as pretty as Hetty, according to Mrs. Poyser. This implies that Dinah has a plain or pale appearance but could be considered equally attractive with some changes.&#10;4. Attire: Dinah wears a Methodist cap which makes her less appealing to some people. In contrast, Hetty's overprettiness is mentioned as a point of comparison.&#10;5. Personality and behavior: Dinah is more subdued and still, while Hetty is more lively and sought after by men. Men would not &quot;run after&quot; Dinah the way they would after Hetty due to societal perceptions of beauty and femininity." />
    <node id="Based on the description provided in the narrative, Hayslope Church has a simple and somewhat shabby interior, characterized by grey age-worn oaken pews arranged on each side of a narrow aisle. The church is free from modern galleries, and the choir has two narrow pews to themselves on the right-hand side. The pulpit and desk, both grey and old, are located on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also houses square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.&#10;&#10;Despite its worn appearance, the combination of grey pews and buff-washed walls creates a pleasing tone that complements the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats of the parishioners. The atmosphere is further warmed by liberal touches of crimson cloth, with handsome crimson cushioned cloth adorning the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew, as well as an embroidered crimson altar-cloth in the chancel, which was embroidered by Miss Lydia's own hand.&#10;&#10;The choir is led by Joshua Rann, who has a notable reading style that adds to the overall impression of the service. The congregation is described as simple and consists of hardy old men, tall stalwart frames of stone-cutters and carpenters, well-to-do farmers with apple-cheeked families, clean old women who are mostly farm laborer's wives, and Mr. Donnithorne and Miss Lydia in their fashionable attire.&#10;&#10;The choir is situated in the middle of the right-hand row, allowing Joshua Rann to easily take his place among them as principal bass and return to his desk after the singing is over. The pulpit and desk are located on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also houses square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.&#10;&#10;Notably, none of the old people in the congregation can read, but they know a few &quot;good words&quot; by heart and participate in the service with simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. The church interior is further enhanced by the presence of crimson cloth, which adds warmth and depth to the overall atmosphere." />
    <node id=" the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts&#10;of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of&#10;its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could&#10;have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their&#10;childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have&#10;seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the&#10;streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery" />
    <node id="all, the Treddleston grocer, was&#10;giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to&#10;his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman,&#10;and they were all sorry for HER, for she had very good kin. Meantime the&#10;men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had&#10;a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church&#10;until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature&#10;entrance--what could they do in church if they were there before service&#10;began?--and they did not conceive that any power in the universe&#10;could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about&#10;&quot;bus'ness.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got&#10;his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry&#10;at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at&#10;once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with&#10;which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the&#10;farmers; for Chad was" />
    <node id="1. The simple and somewhat shabby interior of Hayslope Church, characterized by grey age-worn oaken pews and buff-washed walls, creates a humble yet pleasing atmosphere for worship.&#10;2. The absence of modern galleries and the presence of crimson cloth touches throughout the church add to its warmth and charm.&#10;3. Joshua Rann's unique reading style contributes significantly to the impressive nature of the service. His rich, melodic bass voice and musical ear deliver responses in a chant-like manner, creating an atmosphere of strong calm melancholy, which some might compare to the rush and cadence of wind among autumn boughs.&#10;4. The congregation, made up of hardy old men, stalwart frames of stone-cutters and carpenters, well-to-do farmers, clean old women, and Mr. Donnithorne and Miss Lydia in their fashionable attire, adds to the diversity and inclusiveness of the church.&#10;5. The simplicity and faith of the parishioners, who know &quot;good words&quot; by heart without being able to read, add a sense of sincerity and genuineness to their participation in the service.&#10;6. Joshua Rann's extra severity in glancing over his spectacles at latecomers like Will Maskery adds an element of discipline and respect for the sacred space and proceedings.&#10;7. The presence of Mr. Irwine, dressed in his white surplice and powdered hair with a benignant yet keen countenance, brings a sense of virtue and grace to the service. The streaming sunshine through old windows adds pleasant touches of color on the opposite wall, further enhancing the beauty and tranquility of the setting.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hayslope Church's simple yet pleasing interior, combined with Joshua Rann's unique and moving reading style, contribute to an impressive and touching church service for both regular attendees and chance visitors. The diverse congregation, sincere faith, discipline, Mr. Irwine's calming presence, and the streaming sunlight all add to the overall positive atmosphere of the service." />
    <node id="&#10;slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery&#10;even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it&#10;chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest&#10;conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls&#10;before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical&#10;ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to&#10;inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses.&#10;The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence,&#10;subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance,&#10;like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to&#10;nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the&#10;wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking&#10;about the reading of a parish clerk--a man in rusty spectacles, with&#10;stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is&#10;" />
    <node id="day, for he sat with his mother&#10;and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent&#10;too--all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass&#10;notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into&#10;the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.&#10;&#10;I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his&#10;ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair&#10;thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and&#10;upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen&#10;countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul&#10;beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the&#10;old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that&#10;threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.&#10;&#10;I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family. And there was another pair of dark" />
    <node id="1. Reaffirmation of Old Truths: The sermon chosen for Thias's funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them that they should cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;2. Peaceful Atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service. This peaceful atmosphere transcends understanding, making it accessible to all who hear these familiar and comforting words during this time of mourning.&#10;3. Camaraderie and Belonging: The supportive presence of fellow parishioners also helps ease Beth's immediate grief as she feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures.&#10;4. Focus on Significance of the Ritual: For Beth, being part of a formal burial and having Mr. Irwine read a special service for her husband gives her a sense of accomplishment and importance. This focus on the significance of the ritual helps shift her focus from personal sorrow to providing her husband with a proper send-off.&#10;5. Connection to Community: The sermon's message about living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting resonates with those in attendance, making them feel more connected to their community and less consumed by grief." />
    <node id="1. Adam's thoughts since his father's death have revolved around regret for not being able to reconcile with his father before his passing. He wishes he could have expressed his gratitude for his father's guidance in his youth and asked for forgiveness for any instances of hot-headedness.&#10;2. Adam has been contemplating the value of family tenderness, as well as leading a righteous life, reflecting on the lessons imparted by his father during his lifetime.&#10;3. He has also pondered over the possibility that his father might have experienced a moment of consciousness before death, which could have provided an opportunity for reconciliation. This thought was reinforced by the funeral sermon's mention of Divine dealings not being measured and circumscribed by time.&#10;4. Additionally, Adam has been considering the importance of self-mastery, acknowledging that controlling his will, temper, and pride has always been challenging for him. He wonders if he has ever truly acted out of genuine love or merely out of self-interest.&#10;5. Overall, the solemnity of the funeral and the sermon have led Adam to reflect on the significance of family relationships, righteous living, and the need to confront one's inner struggles with pride and temper." />
    <node id="The grandfather, or Grandad, insists that his grandsons pay attention to what the parson says as a way of reminding them to behave properly in church and show respect during religious services. This is a common expectation passed down from elders to young children in close-knit communities where religion plays a significant role in people's lives.&#10;&#10;Grandad's admonition might also be his way of emphasizing the importance of learning and absorbing moral values, even if he himself does not always follow regular church attendance due to circumstances such as bad weather or rheumatism. By encouraging his grandsons to listen to the parson, Grandad is reinforcing the idea that religious teachings are essential for their upbringing and development, regardless of whether or not he consistently attends church himself.&#10;&#10;Moreover, by reminding them to &quot;mind what the parson says&quot; before they go to church, Grandad may be emphasizing his role as an elder who cares about their moral education, rather than focusing on his personal religious practices. This action further underscores the significance of community values and the role of religion in shaping the lives of young children within this farming community." />
    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, there is no direct information provided by Mr. Craig regarding why Arthur did not attend church. Although Mrs. Poyser hopes that the information would be given spontaneously, Mr. Craig does not mention it. This implies that either Mr. Craig was unaware of Arthur's absence or he simply did not choose to share this information with others.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Craig's views on marriage and his relationship with Hetty, the narrative provides some insight into his character:&#10;   - Hesitation towards matrimony: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. This suggests that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married.&#10;   - Inconsistent statements: On some occasions, especially after consuming an extra glass of grog, Mr. Craig has expressed approval towards Hetty, saying that &quot;the lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse.&quot; However, these are convivial comments made in the heat of the moment, which may not accurately reflect his true feelings or intentions.&#10;   - Unawareness of impression: Mr. Craig is unaware of the impression he produces on others, including Hetty. This can be inferred from his tendency to give information and converse without realizing that others might receive it coldly. In the context of his relationship with Hetty, this could mean that Mr. Craig might not fully grasp her feelings or reactions towards him.&#10;   - Sober passions: The narrative mentions that Mr. Craig is a man of sober passions, which might imply that he approaches relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner. This further supports the idea that his inconsistent statements about Hetty do not necessarily reflect his genuine intentions or feelings towards her." />
    <node id="1. Marty is an observant and curious child who takes notice of his surroundings. He has found the speckled turkey's nest, which he believes deserves a reward.&#10;2. Marty is also financially aware and observant, noticing that his older brother Tommy has more money in his money-box than he does. This may indicate some level of competitiveness or desire for fairness between the brothers.&#10;3. Marty is confident in his abilities and actions, as evidenced by his instinctive assumption that bringing good news (such as finding the turkey's nest) will not result in any negative consequences.&#10;4. The parents' reaction to Marty's request for a reward indicates that they appreciate and encourage their children's curiosity, initiative, and attentiveness to their environment. However, they also prioritize discipline and appropriate behavior, particularly on Sundays when attending church. The threat of taking away the money-boxes serves as a reminder to the children of their responsibilities and expectations." />

We must go straight on&#10;now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a Sunday.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But, Mother,&quot; said Marty, &quot;you said you'd give half-a-crown to find&#10;the speckled turkey's nest. Mayn't I have the half-crown put into my&#10;money-box?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at&#10;their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's round face there was a" />

Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering&#10;along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it&#10;managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got&#10;to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready&#10;sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said&#10;&quot;Lawks!&quot; whenever she was expected to wonder.&#10;&#10;Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to&#10;them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting,&#10;&quot;We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!&quot; with the instinctive&#10;confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this&#10;pleasant surprise, &quot;that's a good lad; why, where is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge.

Marty was quite&#10;sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while&#10;he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had&#10;run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior&#10;Tommy.

    <node id="1. Adam's preoccupation: As Adam struggles to join in the psalm, he might be preoccupied with regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. He may be thinking about all the hard work and earnings he spent on his father but focusing mainly on what his father's feelings might have been at their parting.&#10;2. Unique grief: This sorrow is different from troubles Adam experienced in the past because it stems from the finality of losing his father, who was a significant source of trouble and vexation in his life. Unlike previous hardships, this grief is irreversible, and he can no longer make amends or express his feelings to his father.&#10;3. Grandad's admonition: Grandad insists that his grandsons pay attention to what the parson says as a way of reminding them to behave properly in church and show respect during religious services. This action also emphasizes his role as an elder who cares about their moral education, regardless of whether or not he consistently attends church himself.&#10;4. Old truths reaffirmed: The sermon chosen for Thias' funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them to cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;5. Peaceful atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service.&#10;6. Camaraderie and belonging: The supportive presence of fellow parishioners also helps ease Beth's immediate grief as she feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures.&#10;7. Focus on the significance of the ritual: For Beth, being part of a formal burial and having Mr. Irwine read a special service for her husband gives her a sense of accomplishment and importance. This focus on the significance of the ritual helps shift her focus from personal sorrow to providing her husband with a proper send-off.&#10;8. Connection to community: The sermon's message about living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting resonates with those in attendance, making them feel more connected to their community and less consumed by grief.&#10;9. Differences in men's behavior during burial: Men like Adam and Mr. Poyser might behave differently during a burial ceremony, reflecting their status or relationship to the deceased. For instance, Adam's grief is deeply personal, rooted in regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. Meanwhile, Mr. Poyser, an elderly man who enjoys leisure activities like watching religious processions, might approach the ceremony with a sense of community and tradition, appreciating the solemnity and significance of the ritual." />
    <node id="1. Prompting Adam's thoughts of Hetty: Adam's thoughts of Hetty during the church service are likely triggered by her distress and tears, which he initially misinterprets as deep religious devotion. Her appearance, with her lovely eyes and rosy complexion, may also contribute to his focus on her rather than the service.&#10;2. Effect on Adam's experience: While Adam is aware of Hetty's presence during the church service, these thoughts do not entirely distract him from the service itself. Instead, they blend with his other deep feelings and become a part of his spiritual experience. The service serves as a channel for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation, providing comfort and solace amidst his personal struggles and the loss of his father." />
    <node id=" devise to account for Arthur's absence on the&#10;supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her&#10;again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all&#10;the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with&#10;a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to&#10;herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain--she would&#10;like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in&#10;her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids&#10;with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,&#10;as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.&#10;&#10;But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they&#10;rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church&#10;service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness&#10;of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our&#10;moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of besee" />
    <node id="1. Reasons for not being married: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood, indicating that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married. He is a man of sober passions, approaching relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner.&#10;&#10;2. Tendency to give information: Mr. Craig enjoys giving information, as Mrs. Poyser hopes he will spontaneously mention why Arthur did not attend church. However, she also notes that he is unaware of the impression he produces on others, suggesting that he might not always realize how his conversations are received.&#10;&#10;3. Perception by others: Mr. Craig is held in high esteem by Martin Poyser for his expertise in soils and compost but is less favored by Mrs. Poyser, who finds him self-important. His strong burr in accent is the primary indicator of his Scottish heritage, as his speech does not differ significantly from the Loamshire people around him. Overall, Mr. Craig's interactions reveal that he is a knowledgeable and capable gardener with a tendency to be unaware of how others perceive his actions and statements." />
    <node id="Beth is feeling a sense of stability, familiarity, and comfort as she hears the evening hymn begin at her husband's funeral. The sound of the bassoon and key-bugles marks the start of the service, reminding her of the comforting ritual of communal worship that has provided her with solace in the past. This solemn moment likely helps ease her immediate grief by shifting her focus from personal sorrow to the significance of the ritual itself, giving her a sense of accomplishment and importance in providing her husband with a proper send-off." />
    <node id="The Poyser family consists of Mr. Poyser, who is dressed in a drab Sunday suit with a red-and-green waistcoat, a green watch-ribbon, and excellent grey ribbed stockings hand-knitted by Mrs. Poyser. Mrs. Poyser wears her best clothes but is not described in detail. Hetty, their servant, is dressed in an eye-catching frock with pink spots on a white ground and a hat trimmed with pink, complemented by dark hair and eyes. The family is awaiting the arrival of Adam Bede to walk together to church." />
    <node id="Arthur Donnithorne is the &quot;he&quot; that Hetty expected to see in the pew but did not show up, causing her great disappointment. She had not seen him since their parting in the wood on Thursday evening and was looking forward to meeting him again at church." />
    <node id="1. Emphasizing moral education: The grandfather, or Grandad, encourages his grandsons to listen to the parson as a way to emphasize the importance of learning and absorbing moral values in their upbringing, rather than focusing on his personal religious practices. By reminding them to &quot;mind what the parson says,&quot; he is reinforcing the idea that religious teachings are essential for their development.&#10;2. Role as an elder: Grandad may be emphasizing his role as an elder who cares about the moral education of his grandsons, rather than focusing on his personal religious practices. This action underscores the significance of community values and the role of religion in shaping the lives of young children within this farming community.&#10;3. Occasional church attendance: Grandad may not attend church regularly due to circumstances such as bad weather or rheumatism, but he still attends on Sacrament Sundays and values religious teachings for his grandsons' upbringing. By reminding them to pay attention to the parson, he is encouraging them to absorb these important moral lessons.&#10;4. Personal beliefs: Grandad might have personal beliefs or preferences when it comes to practicing religion that don't necessarily align with regular church attendance. However, this does not diminish his appreciation for religious teachings and their importance in shaping the lives of his grandsons." />
    <edge source="1. The sermon chosen for Thias's funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance, as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine, the vicar, speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them that the present moment is all they can call their own for works of mercy, righteous dealing, and family tenderness. These are old truths, but they become the most startling to people in the week when they have looked on the dead face of someone who has made a part of their lives (Eliot 301). The sermon encourages the congregation to remember the importance of living righteously and cherishing their family ties.&#10;2. As for the words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; they affect the attendees deeply as they blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation (Eliot 301).

Reaffirmation of Old Truths: The sermon chosen for Thias's funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them that they should cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;2. Peaceful Atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service. This peaceful atmosphere transcends understanding, making it accessible to all who hear these familiar and comforting words during this time of mourning.&#10;3.

Adam's thoughts since his father's death have revolved around regret for not being able to reconcile with his father before his passing. He wishes he could have expressed his gratitude for his father's guidance in his youth and asked for forgiveness for any instances of hot-headedness.&#10;2. Adam has been contemplating the value of family tenderness, as well as leading a righteous life, reflecting on the lessons imparted by his father during his lifetime.&#10;3. He has also pondered over the possibility that his father might have experienced a moment of consciousness before death, which could have provided an opportunity for reconciliation. This thought was reinforced by the funeral sermon's mention of Divine dealings not being measured and circumscribed by time.&#10;4. Additionally, Adam has been considering the importance of self-mastery, acknowledging that controlling his will, temper, and pride has always been challenging for him. He wonders if he has ever truly acted out of genuine love or merely out of self-interest.&#10;5. Overall, the solemnity of the funeral and the sermon have led Adam to reflect on the significance of family relationships, righteous living, and the need to confront one's inner struggles with pride and temper.">

The passage mentions that Martin, who is 75 years old, enjoys standing at the yard-gate to watch his family down the field during a religious procession. His wife, Mrs. Poyser, attributes this behavior to older people being satisfied with looking at things and suggests that it may be God's way of quieting them before they go to sleep.&#10;&#10;Martin's actions also demonstrate the role of leisure for elderly individuals. He takes pleasure in doing small bits of work, such as holding the gate open, because he likes to feel useful and believes that his presence contributes to a better crop and better-milked cows. On Sundays, Martin refuses to do any fieldwork, even during hay and corn harvest, due to his belief that working on sacred days is a wicked thing that will not lead to prosperity.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights the importance of religious ceremonies in the community as well. The congregation attends church together, and after the service, they engage in neighborly talk, simple civilities, and invitations to tea. Sunday is depicted as a day when everyone is ready to receive guests, regardless of personal likes and dislikes.&#10;&#10;In summary, religious ceremonies and leisure are portrayed as essential components of life for elderly individuals like Martin Poyser. They offer opportunities for social engagement and provide a sense of purpose and usefulness, even in old age. The passage also underscores the importance of religious ceremonies in fostering community cohesion and fellowship.">

Reaffirmation of Old Truths: The sermon chosen for Thias's funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them that they should cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;2. Peaceful Atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service. This peaceful atmosphere transcends understanding, making it accessible to all who hear these familiar and comforting words during this time of mourning.&#10;3. Camaraderie and Belonging: The supportive presence of fellow parishioners also helps ease Beth's immediate grief as she feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures.&#10;4.

This focus on the significance of the ritual helps shift her focus from personal sorrow to providing her husband with a proper send-off.&#10;5. Connection to Community: The sermon's message about living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting resonates with those in attendance, making them feel more connected to their community and less consumed by grief.">

For her hat&#10;was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a&#10;white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her," target="1. Prompting Adam's thoughts of Hetty: Adam's thoughts of Hetty during the church service are likely triggered by her distress and tears, which he initially misinterprets as deep religious devotion. Her appearance, with her lovely eyes and rosy complexion, may also contribute to his focus on her rather than the service.&#10;2. Effect on Adam's experience: While Adam is aware of Hetty's presence during the church service, these thoughts do not entirely distract him from the service itself. Instead, they blend with his other deep feelings and become a part of his spiritual experience. The service serves as a channel for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation, providing comfort and solace amidst his personal struggles and the loss of his father.">

The passage also underscores the importance of religious ceremonies in fostering community cohesion and fellowship." target="1. Adam's preoccupation: As Adam struggles to join in the psalm, he might be preoccupied with regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. He may be thinking about all the hard work and earnings he spent on his father but focusing mainly on what his father's feelings might have been at their parting.&#10;2. Unique grief: This sorrow is different from troubles Adam experienced in the past because it stems from the finality of losing his father, who was a significant source of trouble and vexation in his life. Unlike previous hardships, this grief is irreversible, and he can no longer make amends or express his feelings to his father.&#10;3. Grandad's admonition: Grandad insists that his grandsons pay attention to what the parson says as a way of reminding them to behave properly in church and show respect during religious services. This action also emphasizes his role as an elder who cares about their moral education, regardless of whether or not he consistently attends church himself.&#10;4. Old truths reaffirmed: The sermon chosen for Thias' funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them to cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;5. Peaceful atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service.&#10;6. Camaraderie and belonging: The supportive presence of fellow parishioners also helps ease Beth's immediate grief as she feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures.&#10;7. Focus on the significance of the ritual: For Beth, being part of a formal burial and having Mr. Irwine read a special service for her husband gives her a sense of accomplishment and importance. This focus on the significance of the ritual helps shift her focus from personal sorrow to providing her husband with a proper send-off.&#10;8. Connection to community: The sermon's message about living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting resonates with those in attendance, making them feel more connected to their community and less consumed by grief.&#10;9. Differences in men's behavior during burial: Men like Adam and Mr. Poyser might behave differently during a burial ceremony, reflecting their status or relationship to the deceased. For instance, Adam's grief is deeply personal, rooted in regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. Meanwhile, Mr. Poyser, an elderly man who enjoys leisure activities like watching religious processions, might approach the ceremony with a sense of community and tradition, appreciating the solemnity and significance of the ritual.">

Based on the narrative, there is no direct information provided by Mr. Craig regarding why Arthur did not attend church. Although Mrs. Poyser hopes that the information would be given spontaneously, Mr. Craig does not mention it. This implies that either Mr. Craig was unaware of Arthur's absence or he simply did not choose to share this information with others.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Craig's views on marriage and his relationship with Hetty, the narrative provides some insight into his character:&#10;   - Hesitation towards matrimony: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. This suggests that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married.&#10;   - Inconsistent statements: On some occasions, especially after consuming an extra glass of grog, Mr. Craig has expressed approval towards Hetty, saying that &quot;the lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse.&quot; However, these are convivial comments made in the heat of the moment, which may not accurately reflect his true feelings or intentions.&#10;   - Unawareness of impression: Mr. Craig is unaware of the impression he produces on others, including Hetty. This can be inferred from his tendency to give information and converse without realizing that others might receive it coldly. In the context of his relationship with Hetty, this could mean that Mr. Craig might not fully grasp her feelings or reactions towards him.&#10;   - Sober passions: The narrative mentions that Mr. Craig is a man of sober passions, which might imply that he approaches relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner. This further supports the idea that his inconsistent statements about Hetty do not necessarily reflect his genuine intentions or feelings towards her.">

Effect on Adam's experience: While Adam is aware of Hetty's presence during the church service, these thoughts do not entirely distract him from the service itself. Instead, they blend with his other deep feelings and become a part of his spiritual experience. The service serves as a channel for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation, providing comfort and solace amidst his personal struggles and the loss of his father.">

The choir, including Joshua Rann, has two narrow pews to themselves on the right-hand side, and the pulpit and desk are also grey and old. The chancel has square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. Despite its shabby appearance, the grey pews and buff-washed walls create a pleasing tone that complements the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats of the parishioners.&#10;&#10;The church interior is further warmed by liberal touches of crimson cloth. The pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew have handsome crimson cushioned cloth, and an embroidered crimson altar-cloth adorns the chancel, which was embroidered by Miss Lydia's own hand.&#10;&#10;The congregation is described as simple, consisting of hardy old men with bent knees and shoulders but still vigorous for their age, tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of stone-cutters and carpenters, well-to-do farmers with apple-cheeked families, clean old women, mostly farm laborer's wives, and Mr. Donnithorne and Miss Lydia in their fashionable attire.&#10;&#10;Hetty is particularly preoccupied with the thought of seeing Arthur Donnithorne again, who she has not seen since Thursday evening in the wood. Her anxiety about his arrival makes her feel chill disappointment when only old Mr. Donnithorne and Miss Lydia pass by her pew.">

The primary purpose of Mr. Craig's visit to the Poysers' farm was to mend Mrs. Poyser's spinning-wheel that had gotten broken. This is discussed toward the end of the excerpt, where Mrs. Poyser asks him to come as soon as he can to fix it.&#10;&#10;2. Mr. Hall's absence is mentioned in passing during the conversation between Dinah and Mrs. Poyser, but his purpose for going away is not directly linked to Mr. Craig's visit. From the dialogue, we learn that Mr. Hall went to Eagledale for a bit of fishing and would return before many days were over. This information is shared by Mrs. Poyser when Dinah expresses concern about not knowing where Mr. Hall was during church. It can be inferred that Mr. Hall's absence was unexpected, as evidenced by the conversation, but it does not directly relate to Mr. Craig's visit or tasks at the farm.">

Although Mrs. Poyser hopes that the information would be given spontaneously, Mr. Craig does not mention it. This implies that either Mr. Craig was unaware of Arthur's absence or he simply did not choose to share this information with others.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Craig's views on marriage and his relationship with Hetty, the narrative provides some insight into his character:&#10;   - Hesitation towards matrimony: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. This suggests that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married.&#10;   - Inconsistent statements: On some occasions, especially after consuming an extra glass of grog, Mr. Craig has expressed approval towards Hetty, saying that &quot;the lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse.&quot; However, these are convivial comments made in the heat of the moment, which may not accurately reflect his true feelings or intentions.&#10;   - Unawareness of impression: Mr. Craig is unaware of the impression he produces on others, including Hetty. This can be inferred from his tendency to give information and converse without realizing that others might receive it coldly. In the context of his relationship with Hetty, this could mean that Mr. Craig might not fully grasp her feelings or reactions towards him.&#10;   - Sober passions: The narrative mentions that Mr. Craig is a man of sober passions, which might imply that he approaches relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner. This further supports the idea that his inconsistent statements about Hetty do not necessarily reflect his genuine intentions or feelings towards her.">

This implies that either Mr. Craig was unaware of Arthur's absence or he simply did not choose to share this information with others.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Craig's views on marriage and his relationship with Hetty, the narrative provides some insight into his character:&#10;   - Hesitation towards matrimony: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. This suggests that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married.&#10;   - Inconsistent statements: On some occasions, especially after consuming an extra glass of grog, Mr. Craig has expressed approval towards Hetty, saying that &quot;the lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse.&quot; However, these are convivial comments made in the heat of the moment, which may not accurately reflect his true feelings or intentions.&#10;   - Unawareness of impression: Mr. Craig is unaware of the impression he produces on others, including Hetty. This can be inferred from his tendency to give information and converse without realizing that others might receive it coldly. In the context of his relationship with Hetty, this could mean that Mr. Craig might not fully grasp her feelings or reactions towards him.&#10;   - Sober passions: The narrative mentions that Mr. Craig is a man of sober passions, which might imply that he approaches relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner. This further supports the idea that his inconsistent statements about Hetty do not necessarily reflect his genuine intentions or feelings towards her.">

    <edge source="The interior of Hayslope Church is described as having grey age worn oaken pews, with no modern galleries present. The choir, including Joshua Rann, has two narrow pews to themselves on the right-hand side, and the pulpit and desk are also grey and old. The chancel has square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.

This sorrow serves as a reminder for Adam to lead a righteous life filled with family tenderness, reflecting the values held by his father." target="1. Adam's preoccupation: As Adam struggles to join in the psalm, he might be preoccupied with regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. He may be thinking about all the hard work and earnings he spent on his father but focusing mainly on what his father's feelings might have been at their parting.&#10;2. Unique grief: This sorrow is different from troubles Adam experienced in the past because it stems from the finality of losing his father, who was a significant source of trouble and vexation in his life. Unlike previous hardships, this grief is irreversible, and he can no longer make amends or express his feelings to his father.&#10;3. Grandad's admonition: Grandad insists that his grandsons pay attention to what the parson says as a way of reminding them to behave properly in church and show respect during religious services. This action also emphasizes his role as an elder who cares about their moral education, regardless of whether or not he consistently attends church himself.&#10;4. Old truths reaffirmed: The sermon chosen for Thias' funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them to cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;5. Peaceful atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service.&#10;6. Camaraderie and belonging: The supportive presence of fellow parishioners also helps ease Beth's immediate grief as she feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures.&#10;7. Focus on the significance of the ritual: For Beth, being part of a formal burial and having Mr. Irwine read a special service for her husband gives her a sense of accomplishment and importance. This focus on the significance of the ritual helps shift her focus from personal sorrow to providing her husband with a proper send-off.&#10;8. Connection to community: The sermon's message about living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting resonates with those in attendance, making them feel more connected to their community and less consumed by grief.&#10;9. Differences in men's behavior during burial: Men like Adam and Mr. Poyser might behave differently during a burial ceremony, reflecting their status or relationship to the deceased. For instance, Adam's grief is deeply personal, rooted in regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. Meanwhile, Mr. Poyser, an elderly man who enjoys leisure activities like watching religious processions, might approach the ceremony with a sense of community and tradition, appreciating the solemnity and significance of the ritual.">

Prompting Adam's thoughts of Hetty: Adam's thoughts of Hetty during the church service are likely triggered by her distress and tears, which he initially misinterprets as deep religious devotion. Her appearance, with her lovely eyes and rosy complexion, may also contribute to his focus on her rather than the service.&#10;2. Effect on Adam's experience: While Adam is aware of Hetty's presence during the church service, these thoughts do not entirely distract him from the service itself. Instead, they blend with his other deep feelings and become a part of his spiritual experience. The service serves as a channel for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation, providing comfort and solace amidst his personal struggles and the loss of his father.">

He is a man of sober passions, approaching relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner.&#10;&#10;2. Tendency to give information: Mr. Craig enjoys giving information, as Mrs. Poyser hopes he will spontaneously mention why Arthur did not attend church. However, she also notes that he is unaware of the impression he produces on others, suggesting that he might not always realize how his conversations are received.&#10;&#10;3. Perception by others: Mr. Craig is held in high esteem by Martin Poyser for his expertise in soils and compost but is less favored by Mrs. Poyser, who finds him self-important. His strong burr in accent is the primary indicator of his Scottish heritage, as his speech does not differ significantly from the Loamshire people around him. Overall, Mr. Craig's interactions reveal that he is a knowledgeable and capable gardener with a tendency to be unaware of how others perceive his actions and statements.">

Although Mrs. Poyser hopes that the information would be given spontaneously, Mr. Craig does not mention it. This implies that either Mr. Craig was unaware of Arthur's absence or he simply did not choose to share this information with others.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Craig's views on marriage and his relationship with Hetty, the narrative provides some insight into his character:&#10;   - Hesitation towards matrimony: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. This suggests that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married.&#10;   - Inconsistent statements: On some occasions, especially after consuming an extra glass of grog, Mr. Craig has expressed approval towards Hetty, saying that &quot;the lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse.&quot; However, these are convivial comments made in the heat of the moment, which may not accurately reflect his true feelings or intentions.&#10;   - Unawareness of impression: Mr. Craig is unaware of the impression he produces on others, including Hetty. This can be inferred from his tendency to give information and converse without realizing that others might receive it coldly. In the context of his relationship with Hetty, this could mean that Mr. Craig might not fully grasp her feelings or reactions towards him.&#10;   - Sober passions: The narrative mentions that Mr. Craig is a man of sober passions, which might imply that he approaches relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner. This further supports the idea that his inconsistent statements about Hetty do not necessarily reflect his genuine intentions or feelings towards her.">

Joshua Rann's unique reading style contributes significantly to the impressive nature of the service. His rich, melodic bass voice and musical ear deliver responses in a chant-like manner, creating an atmosphere of strong calm melancholy, which some might compare to the rush and cadence of wind among autumn boughs.&#10;4.

The simplicity and faith of the parishioners, who know &quot;good words&quot; by heart without being able to read, add a sense of sincerity and genuineness to their participation in the service.&#10;6. Joshua Rann's extra severity in glancing over his spectacles at latecomers like Will Maskery adds an element of discipline and respect for the sacred space and proceedings.&#10;7. The presence of Mr. Irwine, dressed in his white surplice and powdered hair with a benignant yet keen countenance, brings a sense of virtue and grace to the service. The streaming sunshine through old windows adds pleasant touches of color on the opposite wall, further enhancing the beauty and tranquility of the setting.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hayslope Church's simple yet pleasing interior, combined with Joshua Rann's unique and moving reading style, contribute to an impressive and touching church service for both regular attendees and chance visitors. The diverse congregation, sincere faith, discipline, Mr. Irwine's calming presence, and the streaming sunlight all add to the overall positive atmosphere of the service.">

It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery&#10;even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it&#10;chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest&#10;conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls&#10;before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical&#10;ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to&#10;inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses.&#10;The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence,&#10;subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance,&#10;like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to&#10;nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the&#10;wind among the autumn boughs.

This implies that either Mr. Craig was unaware of Arthur's absence or he simply did not choose to share this information with others.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Craig's views on marriage and his relationship with Hetty, the narrative provides some insight into his character:&#10;   - Hesitation towards matrimony: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. This suggests that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married.&#10;   - Inconsistent statements: On some occasions, especially after consuming an extra glass of grog, Mr. Craig has expressed approval towards Hetty, saying that &quot;the lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse.&quot; However, these are convivial comments made in the heat of the moment, which may not accurately reflect his true feelings or intentions.&#10;   - Unawareness of impression: Mr. Craig is unaware of the impression he produces on others, including Hetty. This can be inferred from his tendency to give information and converse without realizing that others might receive it coldly. In the context of his relationship with Hetty, this could mean that Mr. Craig might not fully grasp her feelings or reactions towards him.&#10;   - Sober passions: The narrative mentions that Mr. Craig is a man of sober passions, which might imply that he approaches relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner. This further supports the idea that his inconsistent statements about Hetty do not necessarily reflect his genuine intentions or feelings towards her." target="1.

    <edge source="1. Adam's preoccupation: As Adam struggles to join in the psalm, he might be preoccupied with regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. He may be thinking about all the hard work and earnings he spent on his father but focusing mainly on what his father's feelings might have been at their parting.&#10;2. Unique grief: This sorrow is different from troubles Adam experienced in the past because it stems from the finality of losing his father, who was a significant source of trouble and vexation in his life. Unlike previous hardships, this grief is irreversible, and he can no longer make amends or express his feelings to his father.&#10;3. Grandad's admonition: Grandad insists that his grandsons pay attention to what the parson says as a way of reminding them to behave properly in church and show respect during religious services. This action also emphasizes his role as an elder who cares about their moral education, regardless of whether or not he consistently attends church himself.&#10;4. Old truths reaffirmed: The sermon chosen for Thias' funeral has a significant impact on those in attendance as it brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis. Mr. Irwine speaks of the words &quot;In the midst of life we are in death,&quot; reminding them to cherish their family ties and live righteously, which becomes especially poignant when someone who was once part of their lives has passed away.&#10;5. Peaceful atmosphere: The calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation during the sermon enhances its solemnity. The words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding&quot; provide a sense of solace and comfort to those in attendance, regardless of their ability to fully comprehend or read the service.&#10;6. Camaraderie and belonging: The supportive presence of fellow parishioners also helps ease Beth's immediate grief as she feels a sense of camaraderie and belonging among her fellow churchgoers, who acknowledge her loss with friendly and sympathetic gestures.&#10;7. Focus on the significance of the ritual: For Beth, being part of a formal burial and having Mr. Irwine read a special service for her husband gives her a sense of accomplishment and importance. This focus on the significance of the ritual helps shift her focus from personal sorrow to providing her husband with a proper send-off.&#10;8. Connection to community: The sermon's message about living righteously, cherishing family ties, and recognizing that life is fleeting resonates with those in attendance, making them feel more connected to their community and less consumed by grief.&#10;9. Differences in men's behavior during burial: Men like Adam and Mr. Poyser might behave differently during a burial ceremony, reflecting their status or relationship to the deceased. For instance, Adam's grief is deeply personal, rooted in regret for not reconciling with his father before his death. Meanwhile, Mr. Poyser, an elderly man who enjoys leisure activities like watching religious processions, might approach the ceremony with a sense of community and tradition, appreciating the solemnity and significance of the ritual." target="1. Emphasizing moral education: The grandfather, or Grandad, encourages his grandsons to listen to the parson as a way to emphasize the importance of learning and absorbing moral values in their upbringing, rather than focusing on his personal religious practices. By reminding them to &quot;mind what the parson says,&quot; he is reinforcing the idea that religious teachings are essential for their development.&#10;2. Role as an elder: Grandad may be emphasizing his role as an elder who cares about the moral education of his grandsons, rather than focusing on his personal religious practices. This action underscores the significance of community values and the role of religion in shaping the lives of young children within this farming community.&#10;3. Occasional church attendance: Grandad may not attend church regularly due to circumstances such as bad weather or rheumatism, but he still attends on Sacrament Sundays and values religious teachings for his grandsons' upbringing. By reminding them to pay attention to the parson, he is encouraging them to absorb these important moral lessons.&#10;4. Personal beliefs: Grandad might have personal beliefs or preferences when it comes to practicing religion that don't necessarily align with regular church attendance. However, this does not diminish his appreciation for religious teachings and their importance in shaping the lives of his grandsons.">

    <edge source="1. Prompting Adam's thoughts of Hetty: Adam's thoughts of Hetty during the church service are likely triggered by her distress and tears, which he initially misinterprets as deep religious devotion. Her appearance, with her lovely eyes and rosy complexion, may also contribute to his focus on her rather than the service.&#10;2. Effect on Adam's experience: While Adam is aware of Hetty's presence during the church service, these thoughts do not entirely distract him from the service itself. Instead, they blend with his other deep feelings and become a part of his spiritual experience. The service serves as a channel for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation, providing comfort and solace amidst his personal struggles and the loss of his father." target=" devise to account for Arthur's absence on the&#10;supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her&#10;again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all&#10;the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with&#10;a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to&#10;herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain--she would&#10;like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in&#10;her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids&#10;with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,&#10;as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.&#10;&#10;But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they&#10;rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church&#10;service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness&#10;of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our&#10;moments of keen sensibility.

Reasons for not being married: Mr. Craig has been hesitating for ten years about the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood, indicating that he may be uncertain or reluctant about getting married. He is a man of sober passions, approaching relationships and decisions in a more reserved and cautious manner.&#10;&#10;2. Tendency to give information: Mr. Craig enjoys giving information, as Mrs. Poyser hopes he will spontaneously mention why Arthur did not attend church. However, she also notes that he is unaware of the impression he produces on others, suggesting that he might not always realize how his conversations are received.&#10;&#10;3. Perception by others: Mr. Craig is held in high esteem by Martin Poyser for his expertise in soils and compost but is less favored by Mrs. Poyser, who finds him self-important. His strong burr in accent is the primary indicator of his Scottish heritage, as his speech does not differ significantly from the Loamshire people around him. Overall, Mr. Craig's interactions reveal that he is a knowledgeable and capable gardener with a tendency to be unaware of how others perceive his actions and statements.">

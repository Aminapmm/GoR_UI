    <node id="  A shadow of awe and half-fearful&#10;    anticipation--nobody knew wherefore, nor of what--had all at once&#10;    fallen over the company.&#10;&#10;    They thronged, however, to the now open door, pressing the&#10;    lieutenant-governor, in the eagerness of their curiosity, into the room&#10;    in advance of them.  At the first glimpse they beheld nothing&#10;    extraordinary:  a handsomely furnished room, of moderate size, somewhat&#10;    darkened by curtains; books arranged on shelves; a large map on the&#10;    wall, and likewise a portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, beneath which sat&#10;    the original Colonel himself, in an oaken elbow-chair, with a pen in&#10;    his hand.  Letters, parchments, and blank sheets of paper were on the&#10;    table before him.  He appeared to gaze at the curious crowd, in front&#10;    of which stood the lieutenant-governor; and there was a frown on his&#10;    dark and massive countenance, as if sternly resentful of the boldness&#10;" />

From the look of unutterable woe upon his face, it appeared&#10;    to be his doom to spend eternity in a vain effort to make his accounts&#10;    balance.&#10;&#10;    And now--in a very humble way, as will be seen--we proceed to open our&#10;    narrative.&#10;&#10;" />

The company, tremulous as the leaves of a tree,&#10;    when all are shaking together, drew nearer, and perceived that there&#10;    was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    stare; that there was blood on his ruff, and that his hoary beard was&#10;    saturated with it.  It was too late to give assistance.  The&#10;    iron-hearted Puritan, the relentless persecutor, the grasping and&#10;    strong-willed man was dead! Dead, in his new house!

Under this arched&#10;    doorway, scraping their feet on the unworn threshold, now trod the&#10;    clergymen, the elders, the magistrates, the deacons, and whatever of&#10;    aristocracy there was in town or county.  Thither, too, thronged the&#10;    plebeian classes as freely as their betters, and in larger number.&#10;    Just within the entrance, however, stood two serving-men, pointing some&#10;    of the guests to the neighborhood of the kitchen and ushering others&#10;    into the statelier rooms,--hospitable alike to all, but still with a&#10;    scrutinizing regard to the high or low degree of each.  Velvet garments&#10;    sombre but rich, stiffly plaited ruffs and bands, embroidered gloves,&#10;    venerable beards, the mien and countenance of authority, made it easy&#10;    to distinguish the gentleman of worship, at that period, from the&#10;    tradesman" />

The founder of this stately mansion--a gentleman noted for&#10;    the square and ponderous courtesy of his demeanor, ought surely to have&#10;    stood in his own hall, and to have offered the first welcome to so many&#10;    eminent personages as here presented themselves in honor of his solemn&#10;    festival.  He was as yet invisible; the most favored of the guests had&#10;    not beheld him.  This sluggishness on Colonel Pyncheon's part became&#10;    still more unaccountable, when the second dignitary of the province&#10;    made his appearance, and found no more ceremonious" />
    <node id="  mansion-spacious, ponderously framed of oaken timber, and calculated to&#10;    endure for many generations of his posterity over the spot first&#10;    covered by the log-built hut of Matthew Maule, there was much shaking&#10;    of the head among the village gossips.  Without absolutely expressing a&#10;    doubt whether the stalwart Puritan had acted as a man of conscience and&#10;    integrity throughout the proceedings which have been sketched, they,&#10;    nevertheless, hinted that he was about to build his house over an&#10;    unquiet grave.  His home would include the home of the dead and buried&#10;    wizard, and would thus afford the ghost of the latter a kind of&#10;    privilege to haunt its new apartments, and the chambers into which&#10;    future bridegrooms were to lead their brides, and where children of the&#10;    Pyncheon blood were to be born.  The terror and ugliness of Maule's&#10;    crime, and the wretchedness of his punishment, would darken the freshly&#10;    plastered walls, and infect them early with the scent" />
    <node id="The ominous circumstance affecting the Pyncheon family for generations is the continued presence of Colonel Pyncheon's picture in the room where he died, which is seen as an evil influence that casts a shadow over the house and makes it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there. This is described as if the ghost of the dead progenitor has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune. The picture remaining in the room is said to symbolize this evil influence, and its presence is described as being like a curse that has become a part of the Pyncheon inheritance. This curse is further exemplified by the fact that successive members of the family have met with untimely or suspicious deaths, including Colonel Pyncheon himself, whose sudden death in his new house was said to be accompanied by a voice crying &quot;God hath given him blood to drink!&quot; The continued presence of this evil influence has made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment." />
    <node id=" topic.  It was&#10;    considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel&#10;    Pyncheon's picture--in obedience, it was said, to a provision of his&#10;    will--remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died.  Those&#10;    stern, immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence, and&#10;    so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of&#10;    the passing hour, that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring&#10;    up and blossom there.  To the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of&#10;    superstition in what we figuratively express, by affirming that the&#10;    ghost of a dead progenitor--perhaps as a portion of his own&#10;    punishment--is often doomed to become the Evil Genius of his family.&#10;&#10;    The Pyncheons, in brief, lived along, for the better part of two&#10;    centuries, with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended&#10;    most other New England families during the same period of time.&#10; " />

If so, we are left to dispose of&#10;    the awful query, whether each inheritor of the property--conscious of&#10;    wrong, and failing to rectify it--did not commit anew the great guilt&#10;    of his ancestor, and incur all its original responsibilities.  And&#10;    supposing such to be the case, would it not be a far truer mode of&#10;    expression to say of the Pyncheon family, that they inherited a great&#10;    misfortune, than the reverse?&#10;&#10;    We have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the&#10;    history of the Pyncheon family, in its unbroken connection with the&#10;    House of the Seven Gables; nor to show, as in a magic picture, how the&#10;    rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house&#10;    itself.  As regards its interior life, a large, dim looking-glass used&#10;    to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to contain within its&#10;    depths" />

Now the Seven Gables will be&#10;    new-shingled!&quot;  From father to son, they clung to the ancestral house&#10;    with singular tenacity of home attachment.  For various reasons,&#10;    however, and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on&#10;    paper, the writer cherishes the belief that many, if not most, of the&#10;    successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to&#10;    their moral right to hold it.  Of their legal tenure there could be no&#10;    question; but old Matthew Maule, it is to be feared, trode downward&#10;    from his own age to a far later one, planting a heavy footstep, all the&#10;    way, on the conscience of a Pyncheon.

The popular imagination, indeed,&#10;    long kept itself busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and&#10;    the wizard Maule; the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold&#10;    was remembered, with the very important addition, that it had become a&#10;    part of the Pyncheon inheritance.  If one of the family did but gurgle&#10;    in his throat, a bystander would be likely enough to whisper, between&#10;    jest and earnest, &quot;He has Maule's blood to drink!&quot;  The sudden death of&#10;    a Pyncheon, about a hundred years ago, with circumstances very similar&#10;    to what have been related of the Colonel's exit, was held as giving&#10;    additional probability to the received opinion on this topic.

There were many rumors, some of which have vaguely drifted&#10;    down to the present time, how that appearances indicated violence; that&#10;    there were the marks of fingers on his throat, and the print of a&#10;    bloody hand on his plaited ruff; and that his peaked beard was&#10; " />
    <node id="; it appeared rather to be dying out.  The only members of&#10;    the family known to be extant were, first, the Judge himself, and a&#10;    single surviving son, who was now travelling in Europe; next, the&#10;    thirty years' prisoner, already alluded to, and a sister of the latter,&#10;    who occupied, in an extremely retired manner, the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, in which she had a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor.&#10;    She was understood to be wretchedly poor, and seemed to make it her&#10;    choice to remain so; inasmuch as her affluent cousin, the Judge, had&#10;    repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life, either in the old&#10;    mansion or his own modern residence.  The last and youngest Pyncheon&#10;    was a little country-girl of seventeen, the daughter of another of the&#10;    Judge's cousins, who had married a young woman of no family or&#10;    property, and died early and in poor circumstances.  His widow had&#10;    recently taken another husband.&#10;&#10; " />
    <node id="The old bachelor is an unnamed character who is rumored to be the victim of an almost forgotten murder. He lived in the House of the Seven Gables, which was part of the ancient Pyncheon property. He was a wealthy man who was known for his eccentric and melancholy nature. Due to his interest in old records and traditions, he came to believe that Matthew Maule had been wronged out of his homestead and possibly his life. The old bachelor considered making restitution to Maule's posterity but was prevented by the strong opposition from other Pyncheon relatives who were concerned about their claim to the house. His continued possession of the house, which was built over Maule's burial ground, was seen as a heavy burden on his conscience and that of his descendants. The old bachelor's untimely death in the new house added to the sense of an evil influence or curse hanging over the Pyncheon family for generations." />
    <node id="  Latterly, there were rumors&#10;(which few believed, and only one or two felt greatly interested in)&#10;    that this long-buried man was likely, for some reason or other, to be&#10;    summoned forth from his living tomb.&#10;&#10;    It is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now&#10;    almost forgotten murder.  He was an old bachelor, and possessed of&#10;    great wealth, in addition to the house and real estate which&#10;    constituted what remained of the ancient Pyncheon property.  Being of&#10;    an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind, and greatly given to&#10;    rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions, he had brought&#10;    himself, it is averred, to the conclusion that Matthew Maule, the&#10;    wizard, had been foully wronged out of his homestead, if not out of his&#10;    life.  Such being the case, and he, the old bachelor, in possession of&#10;    the ill-gotten spoil,--with the black stain of blood sunken deep into&#10;    it, and still" />
    <node id=" in possession of&#10;    the ill-gotten spoil,--with the black stain of blood sunken deep into&#10;    it, and still to be scented by conscientious nostrils,--the question&#10;    occurred, whether it were not imperative upon him, even at this late&#10;    hour, to make restitution to Maule's posterity.  To a man living so&#10;    much in the past, and so little in the present, as the secluded and&#10;    antiquarian old bachelor, a century and a half seemed not so vast a&#10;    period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right for wrong.  It&#10;    was the belief of those who knew him best, that he would positively&#10;    have taken the very singular step of giving up the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables to the representative of Matthew Maule, but for the unspeakable&#10;    tumult which a suspicion of the old gentleman's project awakened among&#10;    his Pyncheon relatives.  Their exertions had the effect of suspending&#10;    his purpose; but it was feared that he would perform, after death," />
    <node id="The old Pyncheon House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, is a historic building that has been standing for generations in one of the New England towns. It is a large, rustic wooden house with seven peaked gables facing different directions and a massive chimney at its center. The house has become a local landmark, along with the giant elm tree that grows in front of it, which children call the Pyncheon Elm.&#10;&#10;The house has an eerie and ominous atmosphere, with timbers that seem to hold the memories of many generations. Its second story juts out, giving the building a meditative appearance, as if it is guarding secrets and reflecting on its eventful past. The house seems to have a life of its own, full of rich and somber reminiscences.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune rather than a fortune. This is because the original owner of the house, Colonel Pyncheon, acquired the property through questionable means, causing a curse to befall his descendants. The colonel's picture still hangs in the room where he died, and it is believed that his ghost has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune.&#10;&#10;The old bachelor was a reclusive and eccentric man who lived in the House of the Seven Gables until his untimely death. He was rumored to be the victim of an almost forgotten murder. The old bachelor became obsessed with the idea that Matthew Maule, the original owner of the land, had been wronged out of his property and possibly his life. He considered making restitution to Maule's descendants but was prevented by his relatives who were concerned about their claim to the house.&#10;&#10;The old bachelor's continued possession of the house, which was built over Maule's burial ground, weighed heavily on his conscience and that of his descendants. His untimely death in the new house added to the sense of an evil influence or curse hanging over the Pyncheon family for generations. Overall, the House of the Seven Gables is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations." />

So much of mankind's varied experience had passed&#10;    there,--so much had been suffered, and something, too, enjoyed,--that&#10;    the very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart.  It was&#10;    itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of&#10;    rich and sombre reminiscences.&#10;&#10;    The deep projection of the second story gave the house such a&#10;    meditative look, that you could not pass it without the idea that it&#10;    had secrets to keep, and an eventful history to moralize upon.  In&#10;    front, just on the edge of the unpaved sidewalk, grew the Pyncheon Elm,&#10;    which, in reference to such trees as one usually meets with, might well&#10;    be termed gigantic.  It had been planted by a great-grandson of the&#10;    first Pyncheon, and, though now four-score years of age, or perhaps&#10;    nearer a hundred, was still in its strong and broad maturity" />
    <node id=" to be&#10;worthily recounted, they would form a narrative of no small interest&#10;and instruction, and possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity,&#10;    which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement.  But the&#10;    story would include a chain of events extending over the better part of&#10;    two centuries, and, written out with reasonable amplitude, would fill a&#10;    bigger folio volume, or a longer series of duodecimos, than could&#10;    prudently be appropriated to the annals of all New England during a&#10;    similar period.  It consequently becomes imperative to make short work&#10;    with most of the traditionary lore of which the old Pyncheon House,&#10;    otherwise known as the House of the Seven Gables, has been the theme.&#10;    With a brief sketch, therefore, of the circumstances amid which the&#10;    foundation of the house was laid, and a rapid glimpse at its quaint&#10;    exterior, as it grew black in the prevalent east wind,--pointing, too,&#10;    here and there, at some spot of more verdant mossiness on its roof" />
    <node id="HALFWAY down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty&#10;wooden house, with seven acutely peaked gables, facing towards various&#10;points of the compass, and a huge, clustered chimney in the midst.  The&#10;street is Pyncheon Street; the house is the old Pyncheon House; and an&#10;elm-tree, of wide circumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to&#10;every town-born child by the title of the Pyncheon Elm.  On my&#10;occasional visits to the town aforesaid, I seldom failed to turn down&#10;Pyncheon Street, for the sake of passing through the shadow of these&#10;two antiquities,--the great elm-tree and the weather-beaten edifice.&#10;&#10;The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human&#10;countenance, bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and&#10;sunshine, but expressive also, of the long lapse of mortal life, and&#10;accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within.  Were these to be&#10;worthily recounted, they would form a narrative of no small interest&#10;and instruction, and possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity,&#10; " />
    <node id="Colonel Pyncheon was unresponsive to the loud and persistent knocking on the door because he had already passed away in his new house. The reason for his death is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is mentioned that there were rumors of violence and suspicious circumstances surrounding his demise, such as marks on his throat and a bloody handprint on his ruff. Despite these ominous signs, his death remained a mystery, contributing to the eerie atmosphere in the house.&#10;&#10;The lieutenant-governor's attempts to gain entrance into Colonel Pyncheon's private apartment were unsuccessful because the colonel had expressly wished not to be disturbed during his time in the study. The gathering crowd, driven by curiosity and a shadow of apprehension, eventually entered the room, only to find Colonel Pyncheon seated in his oaken elbow-chair with a frown on his face, as if sternly resentful of their boldness. This unsettling image further added to the eerie atmosphere that pervaded the house.&#10;&#10;The persistent unresponsiveness of Colonel Pyncheon after his death served to enhance the supernatural and ominous circumstances surrounding his passing. The fact that he did not answer the door, even when it was being forcefully knocked on by multiple people, solidified the belief that something strange or otherworldly had occurred in the house. This contributed to the overall eerie atmosphere by creating an air of mystery and unease within the story's setting." />

Then, looking round, with a&#10;    smile, to the spectators, he awaited a response.  As none came,&#10;    however, he knocked again, but with the same unsatisfactory result as&#10;    at first.  And now, being a trifle choleric in his temperament, the&#10;    lieutenant-governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword, wherewith he&#10;    so beat and banged upon the door, that, as some of the bystanders&#10;    whispered, the racket might have disturbed the dead.  Be that as it&#10;    might, it seemed to produce no awakening effect on Colonel Pyncheon.&#10;    When the sound subsided, the silence through the house was deep,&#10;    dreary, and oppressive, notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the&#10;    guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine&#10;    or spirits.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Strange, forsooth!--very" />
    <node id=" became&#10;    still more unaccountable, when the second dignitary of the province&#10;    made his appearance, and found no more ceremonious a reception.  The&#10;    lieutenant-governor, although his visit was one of the anticipated&#10;    glories of the day, had alighted from his horse, and assisted his lady&#10;    from her side-saddle, and crossed the Colonel's threshold, without&#10;    other greeting than that of the principal domestic.&#10;&#10;    This person--a gray-headed man, of quiet and most respectful&#10;    deportment--found it necessary to explain that his master still&#10;    remained in his study, or private apartment; on entering which, an hour&#10;    before, he had expressed a wish on no account to be disturbed.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Do not you see, fellow,&quot; said the high-sheriff of the county, taking&#10;    the servant aside, &quot;that this is no less a man than the&#10;    lieutenant-governor?

    <node id="Colonel Pyncheon anticipated increasing prosperity for himself and his son due to two main reasons. Firstly, they had already come into immediate enjoyment of a rich estate, which provided them with substantial wealth and resources. Secondly, there was a claim through an Indian deed, confirmed by a subsequent grant of the General Court, to a vast and unexplored tract of Eastern lands in what is now known as Waldo County, Maine. This territory was more extensive than many a dukedom or even a reigning prince's territory in Europe, making it a significant potential source of wealth for the Pyncheon family. If the forest covering this wild principality gave way to human culture, as it was expected to eventually, it would become an incalculable source of wealth for the Pyncheons, securing their prosperity for future generations." />
    <node id="&#10;    be the source of incalculable wealth to the Pyncheon blood.  Had the&#10;    Colonel survived only a few weeks longer, it is probable that his great&#10;    political influence, and powerful connections at home and abroad, would&#10;    have consummated all that was necessary to render the claim available.&#10;    But, in spite of good Mr. Higginson's congratulatory eloquence, this&#10;    appeared to be the one thing which Colonel Pyncheon, provident and&#10;    sagacious as he was, had allowed to go at loose ends.  So far as the&#10;    prospective territory was concerned, he unquestionably died too soon.&#10;    His son lacked not merely the father's eminent position, but the talent&#10;    and force of character to achieve it: he could, therefore, effect&#10;    nothing by dint of political interest; and the bare justice or legality&#10;    of the claim was not so apparent, after the Colonel's decease, as it&#10;    had been pronounced in his lifetime.  Some connecting link had slipped&#10;    out of the evidence," />
    <node id=". Mr. Higginson enumerates, among the many&#10;    felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career, the happy&#10;    seasonableness of his death.  His duties all performed,--the highest&#10;    prosperity attained,--his race and future generations fixed on a stable&#10;    basis, and with a stately roof to shelter them for centuries to&#10;    come,--what other upward step remained for this good man to take, save&#10;    the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven! The pious&#10;    clergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the&#10;    least suspected that the Colonel had been thrust into the other world&#10;    with the clutch of violence upon his throat.&#10;&#10;    The family of Colonel Pyncheon, at the epoch of his death, seemed&#10;    destined to as fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the&#10;    inherent instability of human affairs.  It might fairly be anticipated&#10;    that the progress of time would rather increase and ripen their&#10;    prosperity, than wear away and destroy it.  For" />

These possessions--for as such they might almost&#10;    certainly be reckoned--comprised the greater part of what is now known&#10;    as Waldo County, in the state of Maine, and were more extensive than&#10;    many a dukedom, or even a reigning prince's territory, on European&#10;    soil.

    <node id="The 'impalpable claim' to family importance and nobility among the Pyncheon family refers to their belief in their inherited status, prestige, and entitlement due to their ancestor Colonel Pyncheon's position and wealth. This claim is 'impalapable' because it is not based on any concrete or legal grounds but is rather a matter of family tradition, pride, and self-perception.&#10;&#10;This belief in their superior status affected the Pyncheons' social behavior and self-perception over generations by making them feel entitled to certain privileges and resources, such as the disputed land in Maine. It also made them more concerned with maintaining their prestige and image than with addressing moral issues or rectifying past wrongs, such as the possible injustice done to Matthew Maule and his descendants.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheons' 'impalpable claim' to nobility also created a sense of superiority and distance between them and other, less prestigious families, which further reinforced their belief in their own importance and entitlement. This self-perception was passed down through generations, shaping the Pyncheons' identity and worldview, and making it difficult for them to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment.&#10;&#10;In short, the 'impalpable claim' to family importance and nobility among the Pyncheon family was a significant factor in their social behavior and self-perception over generations, reinforcing their belief in their own superiority and entitlement, and making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs." />
    <node id="The passage provides information about the death of Colonel Pyncheon from the verdict of a jury and his funeral sermon. According to the jury's verdict, Colonel Pyncheon's cause of death was &quot;Sudden Death,&quot; suggesting that there were no suspicions of foul play or any specific individuals implicated in his death. The traditional account of his death is attributed to superstition and is therefore considered less reliable than the official record.&#10;&#10;Colonel Pyncheon's funeral sermon, delivered by Reverend Mr. Higginson, highlights the fortunate circumstances of the colonel's life and death. It is mentioned that Colonel Pyncheon died at a time when he had accomplished all his duties and achieved great prosperity, leaving a stable foundation for future generations. The clergyman's words suggest that Colonel Pyncheon's death was natural and timely.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the evidence presented in the passage, Colonel Pyncheon's death is indicated to have been a natural occurrence, as supported by both the jury's verdict and his funeral sermon." />

The rank, wealth, and&#10;    eminent character of the deceased must have insured the strictest&#10;    scrutiny into every ambiguous circumstance.  As none such is on record,&#10;    it is safe to assume that none existed.

Certain circumstances attending this fatal occurrence had&#10;    brought the deed irresistibly home to a nephew of the deceased&#10;    Pyncheon.  The young man was tried and convicted of the crime; but&#10;    either the circumstantial nature of the evidence, and possibly some&#10;    lurking doubts in the breast of the executive, or, lastly--an argument&#10;    of greater weight in a republic than it could have been under a&#10;    monarchy,--the high respectability and political influence of the&#10;    criminal's connections, had availed to mitigate his doom from death to&#10;    perpetual imprisonment.

    <node id="The House of the Seven Gables is a historic building that has stood for generations in a New England town. It was originally built by Thomas Maule, who was the architect hired by Colonel Pyncheon to construct the house on what used to be Maule's property. Maule had built a cottage on the spot due to a natural spring of soft and pleasant water, but he was later forced to give up the land to Colonel Pyncheon. Despite this, Maule performed his duty as an architect faithfully, and the timber framework of the house still holds together today.&#10;&#10;The house has become a local landmark, with seven peaked gables facing different directions and a massive chimney at its center. It has an eerie atmosphere, with timbers that seem to hold the memories of many generations. The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune due to Colonel Pyncheon's questionable means of acquiring the property, causing a curse to befall his descendants.&#10;&#10;The House of the Seven Gables is also significant because it was built over Matthew Maule's burial ground, which weighed heavily on the conscience of the old bachelor who lived in the house until his untimely death. The old bachelor had become obsessed with the idea that Maule had been wronged out of his property and possibly his life, and he considered making restitution to Maule's descendants. However, he was prevented by his relatives who were concerned about their claim to the house.&#10;&#10;In the writer's recollection, the House of the Seven Gables is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations. It is a reminder of the enduring significance of the past and how it continues to shape the present and future.&#10;&#10;In summary, the House of the Seven Gables was built by Thomas Maule and holds great historical significance in the town where it stands. Its builder, Maule, was an architect hired by Colonel Pyncheon, who acquired the land unjustly. The house's association with a curse and the Pyncheon family's haunted past have made it an enduring symbol of the town's history." />

Familiar as it stands in the writer's&#10;    recollection,--for it has been an object of curiosity with him from&#10;    boyhood, both as a specimen of the best and stateliest architecture of&#10;    a longpast epoch, and as the scene of events more full of human&#10;    interest, perhaps, than those of a gray feudal castle,--familiar as it&#10;    stands, in its rusty old age, it is therefore only the more difficult&#10;    to imagine the bright novelty with which it first caught the sunshine.&#10;    The impression of its actual state, at this distance of a hundred and&#10;    sixty years, darkens inevitably through the picture which we would fain&#10; " />

Pyncheon Street formerly bore the humbler appellation of&#10;    Maule's Lane, from the name of the original occupant of the soil,&#10;    before whose cottage-door it was a cow-path.  A natural spring of soft&#10;    and pleasant water--a rare treasure on the sea-girt peninsula where the&#10;    Puritan settlement was made--had early induced Matthew Maule to build a&#10;    hut, shaggy with thatch, at this point, although somewhat too remote&#10;    from what was then the centre of the village.  In the growth of the&#10;    town, however, after some thirty or forty years, the site covered by&#10;    this rude hovel had become exceedingly desirable in the eyes of a&#10;    prominent and powerful personage" />
    <node id="The significance of propinquity and custom in the Pyncheon family's handling of their patrimonial property is that they have a very strong inclination to keep their estate within their own bloodline. This bias towards relatives is so powerful that it overrides other factors such as personal feelings, scruples, or even hatred towards family members. The author notes that this feeling is like a disease in the Pyncheons, and it becomes particularly relevant when discussing testamentary decisions.&#10;&#10;Custom also plays a crucial role in shaping their behavior regarding inheritance, as they adhere to an immemorial custom of sending down their estate in the line marked out by propinquity, which appears as natural to them as any other law. This strong inclination towards preserving family wealth within the bloodline and upholding customary practices ultimately shapes the Pyncheons' social behavior and self-perception, reinforcing their belief in their own superiority and entitlement while making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs." />

But there is no one thing which men&#10;    so rarely do, whatever the provocation or inducement, as to bequeath&#10;    patrimonial property away from their own blood.  They may love other&#10;    individuals far better than their relatives,--they may even cherish&#10;    dislike, or positive hatred, to the latter; but yet, in view of death,&#10;    the strong prejudice of propinquity revives, and impels the testator to&#10;    send down his estate in the line marked out by custom so immemorial&#10;    that it looks like nature.  In all the Pyncheons, this feeling had the&#10;    energy of disease.

    <node id="After the 'witchcraft delusion', Matthew Maule's family, also known as the Maules, continued to live in the same town where their progenitor had suffered an unjust death. They were perceived as a quiet and honest race of people who held no open grudges against individuals or the public for the wrong done to them. However, it is likely that they secretly passed down hostile recollections of Matthew Maule's fate and lost patrimony from generation to generation.&#10;&#10;The Maules may have remembered that the House of the Seven Gables, which was built on what used to be their property, was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that rightfully belonged to them. This would understandably weigh heavily on their conscience as well as that of subsequent Pyncheon family members who lived in the house, including the old bachelor.&#10;&#10;The Maules were believed to possess mysterious attributes and an influence over people's dreams, which modern psychology might attribute to a subconscious manifestation of their long-standing grievance against the Pyncheons. Overall, while the Maules did not actively seek restitution for the wrongs done to their family, they continued to be associated with the House of the Seven Gables, and their presence served as a reminder of the enduring significance of the past and its impact on the present and future." />

The matter is disagreeably delicate to handle; but,&#10;    since the reader must needs be let into the secret, he will please to&#10;    understand, that, about a century ago, the head of the Pyncheons found&#10;    himself involved in serious financial difficulties.  The fellow&#10;    (gentleman, as he styled himself) can hardly have been other than a&#10;    spurious interloper; for, instead of seeking office from the king or&#10;    the royal governor, or urging his hereditary claim to Eastern lands, he&#10;    bethought himself of no better avenue to wealth than by cutting a&#10;    shop-door through the side of his ancestral residence.

This action was seen as a symbol of the family's decline in status and wealth, and a constant reminder of their forebear's financial difficulties. It brought shame to his descendants not because it was a commercial operation, but because it was an unconventional and pitifully small mode of conducting business, which contrasted sharply with the noble lineage claimed by the Pyncheon family. The fact that he resorted to such a measure suggests just how dire his financial situation had become. This act cast a shadow over the house and made it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there, becoming an evil influence and a curse that was passed down through generations of the Pyncheon family." />
    <node id="The most calamitous event in the Pyncheon family history occurred approximately thirty years before the story begins, when a violent death took place among the family members. One member was killed by another, and circumstantial evidence pointed to a nephew of the deceased as the culprit. Although he was tried and convicted for the crime, doubts surrounding the case led to his sentencing being reduced from a death penalty to lifelong imprisonment. This incident has had a lasting impact on the family, with rumors persisting even at the time the story is set, although few people believe them and only a select few show significant interest in the topic.&#10;&#10;There are two key aspects to this event: the violent death itself and the subsequent trial and imprisonment of the nephew. However, the text focuses more on the ominous circumstances surrounding the Pyncheon family rather than providing specific details about the incident. The calamity is described in a way that highlights its symbolic significance for the family's misfortunes, with the picture of Colonel Pyncheon remaining in the room where he died seen as an evil influence casting a shadow over the house and making it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there.&#10;&#10;The text also touches upon other unfortunate events involving the Pyncheons, including the original head of the Pyncheon House cutting a shop-door into their ancestral home due to financial difficulties. This act symbolizes the family's decline in status and wealth and is another example of the evil influence that has affected the Pyncheons for generations.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific details about the most calamitous event in the Pyncheon family are not provided, it is clear that a violent death occurred, for which a nephew was convicted and imprisoned. The event has had a lasting impact on the family, contributing to their reputation for misfortune and ominous circumstances. Rumors about the incident persist but have little credibility among the general population, who are more interested in gossiping about the Pyncheons' history of misfortune than investigating the truth behind these events." />
    <node id="The inherited traits of hard, keen sense and practical energy have played a role in the history of the Pyncheon family in that they have helped members of the family to repeatedly rise again during periods when the family's fortunes were low.

The most notable example of this is the continued presence of Colonel Pyncheon's picture in the room where he died, which is seen as an evil influence that casts a shadow over the house and makes it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there. This curse has made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment, despite their practical energy and determination. Additionally, the fact that the family has clung to their ancestral home with such tenacity suggests a strong sense of pride and tradition, but also an inability to let go of the past and move on from the mistakes of their ancestors." />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, it is stated that the Pyncheon family made efforts for nearly a hundred years to reclaim their inherited land, but their attempts were ultimately unsuccessful. The text mentions that actual settlers, who had worked the land and built their lives there, laughed at the idea of the Pyncheons' claim, which was based on old parchments with faded signatures of long-dead governors and legislators. Over time, parts of the territory were regranted to more favored individuals, and other parts were occupied by settlers, further solidifying their claims to the land. The Pyncheons' impalpable claim, therefore, did not result in any solid gains, and their attempts to regain their inherited land are portrayed as unsuccessful." />

Despite rumors of violence and suspicious circumstances surrounding his demise, such as marks on his throat and a bloody handprint on his ruff, the official record indicates that Colonel Pyncheon's cause of death was &quot;Sudden Death,&quot; suggesting it was a natural occurrence." />
    <node id="Colonel Pyncheon, being a practical-minded Puritan soldier and magistrate, was not deterred from building his house on a cursed site by superstitions about the wizard's ghost or what he considered to be &quot;flimsy sentimentalities.&quot; He was more concerned with carrying out his original plan, which was likely motivated by his ambition and desire for power. The cursed site held symbolic value as it was the location of the log-built hut of Matthew Maule, the man he had accused of witchcraft and who was subsequently executed. By building his mansion on this site, Colonel Pyncheon would be asserting his dominance over the wizard and his descendants, further solidifying his status and influence in the community.

Had he&#10;    been told of a bad air, it might have moved him somewhat; but he was&#10;    ready to encounter an evil spirit on his own ground.  Endowed with&#10;    commonsense, as massive and hard as blocks of granite, fastened&#10;    together by stern rigidity of purpose, as with iron clamps, he followed&#10;    out his original design, probably without so much as imagining an&#10;    objection to it.

This curse made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the family's strong inclination towards preserving family wealth within the bloodline and upholding customary practices reinforced their belief in their own superiority and entitlement, making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs. The most calamitous event in the Pyncheon family history, a violent death and subsequent trial resulting in a nephew's lifelong imprisonment, further contributed to the family's reputation for misfortune and ominous circumstances.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly state how this false belief affected different members of the family in various ways over time; however, it is implied that the Pyncheon family's pursuit of their perceived noble heritage had a lasting impact on each generation. The failed attempts to reclaim their land, the ominous circumstances surrounding the family, and the burdensome weight of their past wrongs all shaped the lives and experiences of individual Pyncheons in various ways.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's false belief in their inherited nobility and eventual claim to princely wealth drove them to pursue their ancestral land for nearly a century without success. This obsession resulted in negative consequences, including curses, evil influences, and an undue sense of entitlement that overshadowed their positive traits and made it difficult for the family to escape their dark past. The text does not provide explicit examples of how this belief affected different members of the family in various ways over time, but it is implied that each generation experienced the consequences of this pursuit in diverse and significant ways." />
    <node id="Yes, it is highly likely that Matthew Maule's past actions and supposed burial on the property would cause his ghost to haunt the new Pyncheon mansion. The villagers believed that building the mansion over Maule's burial ground would give his ghost a &quot;privilege to haunt its new apartments&quot;, and this fear was reinforced by Colonel Pyncheon's unresponsiveness to knocking on the door after his death.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Matthew Maule was accused of witchcraft and subsequently executed, which adds to the supernatural element surrounding his character. The fact that he was wronged out of his homestead and possibly his life further fuels the idea of a curse or evil influence hanging over the Pyncheon family and their property.&#10;&#10;The continued presence of this evil influence has made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment, as evidenced by the untimely or suspicious deaths of successive members of the family, including Colonel Pyncheon himself. Therefore, Matthew Maule's past actions and supposed burial on the property have contributed significantly to the haunted reputation of the House of the Seven Gables and the misfortune experienced by the Pyncheon family." />
    <node id="1. The son being the best workman of his time: It is possible that Colonel Pyncheon, desiring high-quality craftsmanship for his new mansion, hired Matthew Maule's son due to his reputation as an excellent carpenter, regardless of any past animosity between their families.&#10;&#10;2. A symbol of forgiveness or reconciliation: By employing the son, Colonel Pyncheon might have been attempting to make amends or show a gesture of goodwill towards the Maule family, casting aside any previous hostility.&#10;&#10;3. Financial motivations: Matthew Maule's son may have been willing to work for his father's enemy in order to earn an honest living and support his family, overcoming any personal grievances for the sake of financial stability.&#10;&#10;4. The coarseness and matter-of-fact character of the age: During this time period, it was not uncommon for people to prioritize practical concerns, such as earning a good wage, over emotional or historical conflicts between families. Matthew Maule's son might have simply seen this opportunity as a way to provide for himself and his family without considering the broader implications of working for the Pyncheons." />

Not improbably he was the&#10;    best workman of his time; or, perhaps, the Colonel thought it&#10;    expedient, or was impelled by some better feeling, thus openly to cast&#10;    aside all animosity against the race of his fallen antagonist.  Nor was&#10;    it out of keeping with the general coarseness and matter-of-fact&#10;    character of the age, that the son should be willing to earn an honest&#10;    penny, or, rather, a weighty amount of sterling pounds, from the purse&#10;    of his father's deadly enemy" />

On the score of delicacy, or any scrupulousness which&#10;    a finer sensibility might have taught him, the Colonel, like most of&#10;    his breed and generation, was impenetrable.  He therefore dug his&#10;    cellar, and laid the deep foundations of his mansion, on the square of&#10;    earth whence Matthew Maule, forty years before, had first swept away&#10;    the fallen leaves.

At the moment of execution--with the halter about his neck,&#10;    and while Colonel Pyncheon sat on horseback, grimly gazing at the scene&#10;    Maule had addressed him from the scaffold, and uttered a prophecy, of&#10;    which history, as well as fireside tradition, has preserved the very&#10;    words.  &quot;God,&quot; said the dying man, pointing his finger, with a ghastly&#10;    look, at the undismayed countenance of his enemy,--&quot;God will give him&#10;    blood to drink!&quot;  After the reputed wizard's death, his humble&#10;    homestead had fallen an easy spoil into Colonel Pyncheon's grasp.

    <node id="The old Pyncheon's commercial operations were conducted in a small and pitiful manner, with him even handling change and checking half-pennies himself. This was seen as a stark contrast to the noble lineage claimed by the Pyncheon family and was a source of shame for his descendants. The shop-door that he cut into the ancestral home became a symbol of the family's decline in status and wealth, and its presence cast a shadow over the house, making it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there.&#10;&#10;Since the old Pyncheon's death, the shop-door has been locked, bolted, and barred and has probably never once been opened. The shelves, counter, and other fixtures of the little shop remain just as he left them. It is said that the dead shop-keeper, dressed in a white wig, faded velvet coat, apron, and holding a half-penny in his hand, still sits in his old elbow-chair, surrounded by curious crowds at the opening of the door." />
    <node id="Colonel Pyncheon anticipated an increase in his family's prosperity over time due to two main factors: firstly, they had inherited a rich estate that provided them with substantial wealth and resources; secondly, there was a claim through an Indian deed and a subsequent grant of the General Court to a vast tract of Eastern lands in what is now known as Waldo County, Maine. This territory was more extensive than many a dukedom or even a reigning prince's territory in Europe, making it a significant potential source of wealth for the Pyncheon family. If the forest covering this wild principality gave way to human culture, as it was expected to eventually, it would become an incalculable source of wealth for the Pyncheons, securing their prosperity for future generations. The land they had claims to included a significant portion of Waldo County, Maine, which was more extensive than many European territories and held great potential for increasing their wealth." />
    <node id=" Pyncheons were accustomed to consult the Colonel's&#10;    ancient map, which had been projected while Waldo County was still an&#10;    unbroken wilderness.   Where the old land surveyor had put down woods,&#10;    lakes, and rivers, they marked out the cleared spaces, and dotted the&#10;    villages and towns, and calculated the progressively increasing value&#10;    of the territory, as if there were yet a prospect of its ultimately&#10;    forming a princedom for themselves.&#10;&#10;    In almost every generation, nevertheless, there happened to be some one&#10;    descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard, keen sense,&#10;    and practical energy, that had so remarkably distinguished the original&#10;    founder.

    <node id="The tragic event in the Pyncheon family history refers to a violent death among the family members that occurred approximately thirty years before the story begins. One member was killed by another, and circumstantial evidence pointed to a nephew of the deceased as the culprit. The nephew was tried and convicted for the crime, but doubts surrounding the case led to his sentencing being reduced from a death penalty to lifelong imprisonment. This incident had a lasting impact on the family, with rumors persisting even at the time the story is set, although few people believe them.&#10;&#10;The text focuses more on the ominous circumstances surrounding the Pyncheon family rather than providing specific details about the incident. The calamity is described in a way that highlights its symbolic significance for the family's misfortunes, with the picture of Colonel Pyncheon remaining in the room where he died seen as an evil influence casting a shadow over the house and making it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there. This event has contributed to the Pyncheons' reputation for misfortune and ominous circumstances, which is further exemplified by other unfortunate events involving the family, such as the original head of the Pyncheon House cutting a shop-door into their ancestral home due to financial difficulties." />

They were perceived as a quiet and honest race of people but likely held onto hostile recollections of Matthew Maule's fate and lost patrimony from generation to generation.&#10;2. The Maules may have secretly remembered that the House of the Seven Gables, built on what used to be their property, was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that rightfully belonged to them. This could have weighed heavily on their conscience as well as that of subsequent Pyncheon family members who lived in the house, including the old bachelor.&#10;3.

    <node id="Many of the successive Pyncheon proprietors had doubts and concerns about their moral right to hold the estate due to the lingering influence of Matthew Maule. This ancestor's curse, &quot;God will give him blood to drink!&quot;, became a part of the Pyncheon family inheritance and created a sense of an evil influence or curse hanging over them for generations.&#10;&#10;Matthew Maule was a laborer who had built his log-built hut on what would later become the site of the Pyncheon mansion. After Maule's execution, Colonel Pyncheon acquired his land with little resistance and planned to build his mansion over the burial ground. This event contributed to the belief in an evil influence or curse hanging over the Pyncheon family and their property for generations.&#10;&#10;The villagers believed that building the mansion over Maule's burial ground gave his ghost a &quot;privilege to haunt its new apartments&quot;. These superstitions, combined with Colonel Pyncheon's unresponsiveness to knocking on the door after his death, reinforced the fear of an evil presence in the house. The sense of guilt and unease was further perpetuated by Matthew Maule's status as a wronged man who had been accused of witchcraft and executed unjustly, making it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment.&#10;&#10;The moral doubts and concerns of the successive Pyncheon proprietors about their right to hold the estate were primarily due to Matthew Maule's past actions, his supposed burial on the property, and the curse he had uttered before his death. These elements significantly contributed to the haunted reputation of the House of the Seven Gables and the misfortune experienced by the Pyncheon family." />
    <node id="The old Pyncheon House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, is a historic building that has been standing for generations in a New England town. It is a large, rustic wooden house with seven peaked gables facing different directions and a massive chimney at its center. The house has become a local landmark, along with the giant elm tree that grows in front of it, which children call the Pyncheon Elm.&#10;&#10;The house has an eerie and ominous atmosphere, with timbers that seem to hold the memories of many generations. Its second story juts out, giving the building a meditative appearance, as if it is guarding secrets and reflecting on its eventful past. The house seems to have a life of its own, full of rich and somber reminiscences.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune rather than a fortune. This is because the original owner of the house, Colonel Pyncheon, acquired the property through questionable means, causing a curse to befall his descendants. The colonel's picture still hangs in the room where he died, and it is believed that his ghost has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune.&#10;&#10;The house is full of traditionary lore and a rich history, but most of it cannot be recounted as it would require a bigger folio volume or a longer series of duodecimos. The house is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations. Overall, the House of the Seven Gables is an interesting and instructive narrative with a certain remarkable unity, which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement." />

The clergyman's words suggest that Colonel Pyncheon's death was natural and timely.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the evidence presented in the passage, Colonel Pyncheon's death is indicated to have been a natural occurrence, as supported by both the jury's verdict and his funeral sermon.">

This curse is further exemplified by the fact that successive members of the family have met with untimely or suspicious deaths, including Colonel Pyncheon himself, whose sudden death in his new house was said to be accompanied by a voice crying &quot;God hath given him blood to drink!&quot; The continued presence of this evil influence has made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment." target="The old Pyncheon House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, is a historic building that has been standing for generations in one of the New England towns. It is a large, rustic wooden house with seven peaked gables facing different directions and a massive chimney at its center. The house has become a local landmark, along with the giant elm tree that grows in front of it, which children call the Pyncheon Elm.&#10;&#10;The house has an eerie and ominous atmosphere, with timbers that seem to hold the memories of many generations. Its second story juts out, giving the building a meditative appearance, as if it is guarding secrets and reflecting on its eventful past. The house seems to have a life of its own, full of rich and somber reminiscences.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune rather than a fortune. This is because the original owner of the house, Colonel Pyncheon, acquired the property through questionable means, causing a curse to befall his descendants. The colonel's picture still hangs in the room where he died, and it is believed that his ghost has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune.&#10;&#10;The old bachelor was a reclusive and eccentric man who lived in the House of the Seven Gables until his untimely death. He was rumored to be the victim of an almost forgotten murder. The old bachelor became obsessed with the idea that Matthew Maule, the original owner of the land, had been wronged out of his property and possibly his life. He considered making restitution to Maule's descendants but was prevented by his relatives who were concerned about their claim to the house.&#10;&#10;The old bachelor's continued possession of the house, which was built over Maule's burial ground, weighed heavily on his conscience and that of his descendants. His untimely death in the new house added to the sense of an evil influence or curse hanging over the Pyncheon family for generations. Overall, the House of the Seven Gables is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations.">

The reason for his death is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is mentioned that there were rumors of violence and suspicious circumstances surrounding his demise, such as marks on his throat and a bloody handprint on his ruff. Despite these ominous signs, his death remained a mystery, contributing to the eerie atmosphere in the house.&#10;&#10;The lieutenant-governor's attempts to gain entrance into Colonel Pyncheon's private apartment were unsuccessful because the colonel had expressly wished not to be disturbed during his time in the study. The gathering crowd, driven by curiosity and a shadow of apprehension, eventually entered the room, only to find Colonel Pyncheon seated in his oaken elbow-chair with a frown on his face, as if sternly resentful of their boldness. This unsettling image further added to the eerie atmosphere that pervaded the house.&#10;&#10;The persistent unresponsiveness of Colonel Pyncheon after his death served to enhance the supernatural and ominous circumstances surrounding his passing. The fact that he did not answer the door, even when it was being forcefully knocked on by multiple people, solidified the belief that something strange or otherworldly had occurred in the house. This contributed to the overall eerie atmosphere by creating an air of mystery and unease within the story's setting.">

This claim is 'impalapable' because it is not based on any concrete or legal grounds but is rather a matter of family tradition, pride, and self-perception.&#10;&#10;This belief in their superior status affected the Pyncheons' social behavior and self-perception over generations by making them feel entitled to certain privileges and resources, such as the disputed land in Maine. It also made them more concerned with maintaining their prestige and image than with addressing moral issues or rectifying past wrongs, such as the possible injustice done to Matthew Maule and his descendants.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheons' 'impalpable claim' to nobility also created a sense of superiority and distance between them and other, less prestigious families, which further reinforced their belief in their own importance and entitlement. This self-perception was passed down through generations, shaping the Pyncheons' identity and worldview, and making it difficult for them to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment.&#10;&#10;In short, the 'impalpable claim' to family importance and nobility among the Pyncheon family was a significant factor in their social behavior and self-perception over generations, reinforcing their belief in their own superiority and entitlement, and making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs.">

This bias towards relatives is so powerful that it overrides other factors such as personal feelings, scruples, or even hatred towards family members. The author notes that this feeling is like a disease in the Pyncheons, and it becomes particularly relevant when discussing testamentary decisions.&#10;&#10;Custom also plays a crucial role in shaping their behavior regarding inheritance, as they adhere to an immemorial custom of sending down their estate in the line marked out by propinquity, which appears as natural to them as any other law. This strong inclination towards preserving family wealth within the bloodline and upholding customary practices ultimately shapes the Pyncheons' social behavior and self-perception, reinforcing their belief in their own superiority and entitlement while making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs.">

This claim is 'impalapable' because it is not based on any concrete or legal grounds but is rather a matter of family tradition, pride, and self-perception.&#10;&#10;This belief in their superior status affected the Pyncheons' social behavior and self-perception over generations by making them feel entitled to certain privileges and resources, such as the disputed land in Maine. It also made them more concerned with maintaining their prestige and image than with addressing moral issues or rectifying past wrongs, such as the possible injustice done to Matthew Maule and his descendants.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheons' 'impalpable claim' to nobility also created a sense of superiority and distance between them and other, less prestigious families, which further reinforced their belief in their own importance and entitlement.

According to the jury's verdict, Colonel Pyncheon's cause of death was &quot;Sudden Death,&quot; suggesting that there were no suspicions of foul play or any specific individuals implicated in his death. The traditional account of his death is attributed to superstition and is therefore considered less reliable than the official record.&#10;&#10;Colonel Pyncheon's funeral sermon, delivered by Reverend Mr. Higginson, highlights the fortunate circumstances of the colonel's life and death. It is mentioned that Colonel Pyncheon died at a time when he had accomplished all his duties and achieved great prosperity, leaving a stable foundation for future generations. The clergyman's words suggest that Colonel Pyncheon's death was natural and timely.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the evidence presented in the passage, Colonel Pyncheon's death is indicated to have been a natural occurrence, as supported by both the jury's verdict and his funeral sermon.">

One member was killed by another, and circumstantial evidence pointed to a nephew of the deceased as the culprit. Although he was tried and convicted for the crime, doubts surrounding the case led to his sentencing being reduced from a death penalty to lifelong imprisonment. This incident has had a lasting impact on the family, with rumors persisting even at the time the story is set, although few people believe them and only a select few show significant interest in the topic.&#10;&#10;There are two key aspects to this event: the violent death itself and the subsequent trial and imprisonment of the nephew. However, the text focuses more on the ominous circumstances surrounding the Pyncheon family rather than providing specific details about the incident. The calamity is described in a way that highlights its symbolic significance for the family's misfortunes, with the picture of Colonel Pyncheon remaining in the room where he died seen as an evil influence casting a shadow over the house and making it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there.&#10;&#10;The text also touches upon other unfortunate events involving the Pyncheons, including the original head of the Pyncheon House cutting a shop-door into their ancestral home due to financial difficulties. This act symbolizes the family's decline in status and wealth and is another example of the evil influence that has affected the Pyncheons for generations.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific details about the most calamitous event in the Pyncheon family are not provided, it is clear that a violent death occurred, for which a nephew was convicted and imprisoned. The event has had a lasting impact on the family, contributing to their reputation for misfortune and ominous circumstances. Rumors about the incident persist but have little credibility among the general population, who are more interested in gossiping about the Pyncheons' history of misfortune than investigating the truth behind these events.">

The cursed site held symbolic value as it was the location of the log-built hut of Matthew Maule, the man he had accused of witchcraft and who was subsequently executed. By building his mansion on this site, Colonel Pyncheon would be asserting his dominance over the wizard and his descendants, further solidifying his status and influence in the community. Additionally, as a Puritan, he may have believed that he could overcome any curse or evil spirit through the power of his faith and commonsense.">

The house seems to have a life of its own, full of rich and somber reminiscences.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune rather than a fortune. This is because the original owner of the house, Colonel Pyncheon, acquired the property through questionable means, causing a curse to befall his descendants. The colonel's picture still hangs in the room where he died, and it is believed that his ghost has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune.&#10;&#10;The old bachelor was a reclusive and eccentric man who lived in the House of the Seven Gables until his untimely death. He was rumored to be the victim of an almost forgotten murder. The old bachelor became obsessed with the idea that Matthew Maule, the original owner of the land, had been wronged out of his property and possibly his life. He considered making restitution to Maule's descendants but was prevented by his relatives who were concerned about their claim to the house.&#10;&#10;The old bachelor's continued possession of the house, which was built over Maule's burial ground, weighed heavily on his conscience and that of his descendants. His untimely death in the new house added to the sense of an evil influence or curse hanging over the Pyncheon family for generations. Overall, the House of the Seven Gables is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations.">

The house seems to have a life of its own, full of rich and somber reminiscences.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune rather than a fortune. This is because the original owner of the house, Colonel Pyncheon, acquired the property through questionable means, causing a curse to befall his descendants. The colonel's picture still hangs in the room where he died, and it is believed that his ghost has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune.&#10;&#10;The house is full of traditionary lore and a rich history, but most of it cannot be recounted as it would require a bigger folio volume or a longer series of duodecimos. The house is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations. Overall, the House of the Seven Gables is an interesting and instructive narrative with a certain remarkable unity, which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement.">

However, it is likely that they secretly passed down hostile recollections of Matthew Maule's fate and lost patrimony from generation to generation.&#10;&#10;The Maules may have remembered that the House of the Seven Gables, which was built on what used to be their property, was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that rightfully belonged to them.

Overall, while the Maules did not actively seek restitution for the wrongs done to their family, they continued to be associated with the House of the Seven Gables, and their presence served as a reminder of the enduring significance of the past and its impact on the present and future.">

This claim is 'impalapable' because it is not based on any concrete or legal grounds but is rather a matter of family tradition, pride, and self-perception.&#10;&#10;This belief in their superior status affected the Pyncheons' social behavior and self-perception over generations by making them feel entitled to certain privileges and resources, such as the disputed land in Maine. It also made them more concerned with maintaining their prestige and image than with addressing moral issues or rectifying past wrongs, such as the possible injustice done to Matthew Maule and his descendants.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheons' 'impalpable claim' to nobility also created a sense of superiority and distance between them and other, less prestigious families, which further reinforced their belief in their own importance and entitlement.

The villagers believed that building the mansion over Maule's burial ground would give his ghost a &quot;privilege to haunt its new apartments&quot;, and this fear was reinforced by Colonel Pyncheon's unresponsiveness to knocking on the door after his death.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Matthew Maule was accused of witchcraft and subsequently executed, which adds to the supernatural element surrounding his character. The fact that he was wronged out of his homestead and possibly his life further fuels the idea of a curse or evil influence hanging over the Pyncheon family and their property.&#10;&#10;The continued presence of this evil influence has made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment, as evidenced by the untimely or suspicious deaths of successive members of the family, including Colonel Pyncheon himself. Therefore, Matthew Maule's past actions and supposed burial on the property have contributed significantly to the haunted reputation of the House of the Seven Gables and the misfortune experienced by the Pyncheon family.">

    <edge source="The House of the Seven Gables is a historic building that has stood for generations in a New England town. It was originally built by Thomas Maule, who was the architect hired by Colonel Pyncheon to construct the house on what used to be Maule's property. Maule had built a cottage on the spot due to a natural spring of soft and pleasant water, but he was later forced to give up the land to Colonel Pyncheon. Despite this, Maule performed his duty as an architect faithfully, and the timber framework of the house still holds together today.&#10;&#10;The house has become a local landmark, with seven peaked gables facing different directions and a massive chimney at its center. It has an eerie atmosphere, with timbers that seem to hold the memories of many generations. The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune due to Colonel Pyncheon's questionable means of acquiring the property, causing a curse to befall his descendants.&#10;&#10;The House of the Seven Gables is also significant because it was built over Matthew Maule's burial ground, which weighed heavily on the conscience of the old bachelor who lived in the house until his untimely death. The old bachelor had become obsessed with the idea that Maule had been wronged out of his property and possibly his life, and he considered making restitution to Maule's descendants. However, he was prevented by his relatives who were concerned about their claim to the house.&#10;&#10;In the writer's recollection, the House of the Seven Gables is a symbol of the Pyncheon family's haunted past and the curse that has been passed down through generations. It is a reminder of the enduring significance of the past and how it continues to shape the present and future.&#10;&#10;In summary, the House of the Seven Gables was built by Thomas Maule and holds great historical significance in the town where it stands. Its builder, Maule, was an architect hired by Colonel Pyncheon, who acquired the land unjustly. The house's association with a curse and the Pyncheon family's haunted past have made it an enduring symbol of the town's history." target="1.

This belief created an unhealthy obsession with their ancestral home and land, driving them to make repeated attempts to reclaim it for nearly a hundred years. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful due to actual settlers having established claims on the land, rendering the Pyncheon's old parchments and faded signatures irrelevant.&#10;&#10;The family's fixation on their perceived nobility resulted in negative consequences, including the curses and evil influences that overshadowed their practical energy and determination. The most significant example of this is the continued presence of Colonel Pyncheon's picture in the room where he died, which cast a shadow over the house and made it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there. This curse made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the family's strong inclination towards preserving family wealth within the bloodline and upholding customary practices reinforced their belief in their own superiority and entitlement, making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs. The most calamitous event in the Pyncheon family history, a violent death and subsequent trial resulting in a nephew's lifelong imprisonment, further contributed to the family's reputation for misfortune and ominous circumstances.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly state how this false belief affected different members of the family in various ways over time; however, it is implied that the Pyncheon family's pursuit of their perceived noble heritage had a lasting impact on each generation. The failed attempts to reclaim their land, the ominous circumstances surrounding the family, and the burdensome weight of their past wrongs all shaped the lives and experiences of individual Pyncheons in various ways.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's false belief in their inherited nobility and eventual claim to princely wealth drove them to pursue their ancestral land for nearly a century without success. This obsession resulted in negative consequences, including curses, evil influences, and an undue sense of entitlement that overshadowed their positive traits and made it difficult for the family to escape their dark past. The text does not provide explicit examples of how this belief affected different members of the family in various ways over time, but it is implied that each generation experienced the consequences of this pursuit in diverse and significant ways.">

The text mentions that actual settlers, who had worked the land and built their lives there, laughed at the idea of the Pyncheons' claim, which was based on old parchments with faded signatures of long-dead governors and legislators. Over time, parts of the territory were regranted to more favored individuals, and other parts were occupied by settlers, further solidifying their claims to the land. The Pyncheons' impalpable claim, therefore, did not result in any solid gains, and their attempts to regain their inherited land are portrayed as unsuccessful." target="The Pyncheon family's false belief in their inherited nobility and claim to princely wealth had a significant impact on the family over generations. This belief created an unhealthy obsession with their ancestral home and land, driving them to make repeated attempts to reclaim it for nearly a hundred years. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful due to actual settlers having established claims on the land, rendering the Pyncheon's old parchments and faded signatures irrelevant.&#10;&#10;The family's fixation on their perceived nobility resulted in negative consequences, including the curses and evil influences that overshadowed their practical energy and determination. The most significant example of this is the continued presence of Colonel Pyncheon's picture in the room where he died, which cast a shadow over the house and made it difficult for good thoughts or purposes to thrive there. This curse made it difficult for the Pyncheons to escape their dark past and find happiness or contentment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the family's strong inclination towards preserving family wealth within the bloodline and upholding customary practices reinforced their belief in their own superiority and entitlement, making it difficult for them to escape the burden of their past wrongs. The most calamitous event in the Pyncheon family history, a violent death and subsequent trial resulting in a nephew's lifelong imprisonment, further contributed to the family's reputation for misfortune and ominous circumstances.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly state how this false belief affected different members of the family in various ways over time; however, it is implied that the Pyncheon family's pursuit of their perceived noble heritage had a lasting impact on each generation. The failed attempts to reclaim their land, the ominous circumstances surrounding the family, and the burdensome weight of their past wrongs all shaped the lives and experiences of individual Pyncheons in various ways.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's false belief in their inherited nobility and eventual claim to princely wealth drove them to pursue their ancestral land for nearly a century without success. This obsession resulted in negative consequences, including curses, evil influences, and an undue sense of entitlement that overshadowed their positive traits and made it difficult for the family to escape their dark past. The text does not provide explicit examples of how this belief affected different members of the family in various ways over time, but it is implied that each generation experienced the consequences of this pursuit in diverse and significant ways.">

    <edge source="The old Pyncheon House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, is a historic building that has been standing for generations in a New England town. It is a large, rustic wooden house with seven peaked gables facing different directions and a massive chimney at its center. The house has become a local landmark, along with the giant elm tree that grows in front of it, which children call the Pyncheon Elm.&#10;&#10;The house has an eerie and ominous atmosphere, with timbers that seem to hold the memories of many generations. Its second story juts out, giving the building a meditative appearance, as if it is guarding secrets and reflecting on its eventful past. The house seems to have a life of its own, full of rich and somber reminiscences.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, who have lived in the house for generations, are said to have inherited a great misfortune rather than a fortune. This is because the original owner of the house, Colonel Pyncheon, acquired the property through questionable means, causing a curse to befall his descendants. The colonel's picture still hangs in the room where he died, and it is believed that his ghost has become the family's Evil Genius, haunting them and causing misfortune.&#10;&#10;The house is full of traditionary lore and a rich history, but most of it cannot be recounted as it would require a bigger folio volume or a longer series of duodecimos.

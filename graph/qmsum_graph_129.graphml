    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh it fell off . One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready . Okay . Welcome to this second meeting . Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . Um I did {disfmarker} took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's {disfmarker} I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ? Is this ap everybody agree with this ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Oops .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .

    <node id="aker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . {vocalsound} Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting {vocalsound} Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh I think so ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Did I miss something" />

    <node id=" Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , you had the other power channel .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . {vocalsound} And this is this is also supported by the market research .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Thank you . That's my contribution .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation . I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , press them .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And then w be patient . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , here we go .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Tada .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And if you want it to go into" />
    <node id="1. Limited use during nighttime: The industrial designer mentioned that solar power may not be a good option when watching TV at night, as it requires sunlight to generate energy.&#10;2. Potential solution - Energy storage: The project manager suggested that solar power could work by storing up energy during the day and then using it at night. However, this could potentially make the device heavier and more expensive.&#10;3. Alternative solution - Rechargeable battery: Another potential solution discussed was using a rechargeable internal battery, which would be more convenient and economical in the long run, even if it costs more to develop and install initially. This idea was brought up by the User Interface representative and supported by the marketing speaker." />
    <node id="ound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well it is just so annoying how {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Depen&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It would have to sor store up the energy&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .

I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ?

    <node id=" .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It's doing its thing . There we are .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Alright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar {disfmarker} of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real" />

    <node id="1. User Interface: The user interface of this mass-produced device is designed to be simple and intuitive, focusing on what the device looks like, what the buttons look like, and how they feel. There was a suggestion from the User Interface representative and the marketing speaker to incorporate speech recognition into the design, but the industrial designer expressed concerns about fitting this feature into the desired price range.&#10;2. Technical Aspects: The technical end of the device involves an energy source, most likely a battery, and the user interface containing a chip that translates button presses into messages. The project manager mentioned the need for ease of repair or replacement of components such as the battery or chip, in case they fail over time. There was also discussion about potential frequency segregation for this device, to distinguish it from other devices like DVD players, but the industrial designer did not consider this a high priority for a mass-produced, possibly disposable device.&#10;3. Battery Consideration: The team discussed different battery options, with an initial preference for a rechargeable internal battery brought up by the User Interface representative and supported by the marketing speaker. Although it may cost more to develop and install initially, they argued that it would be more convenient and economical in the long run. However, the project manager expressed concerns about the potential weight and cost of this solution.&#10;&#10;In summary, the user interface of this mass-produced device is designed to be simple and intuitive, with discussions around incorporating speech recognition and various battery options, including a rechargeable internal battery. The technical aspects focus on ease of repair or replacement of components, while frequency segregation was considered less important for this type of device." />
    <node id=" is where the user comes in of {disfmarker} what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um {disfmarker} because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial" />
    <node id=" do it on the whiteboard . {vocalsound} So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm-mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . {vocalsound} Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . {vocalsound} Thank you .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . Right . But those things {disfmarker} as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of {disfmarker} what what does it look like ?

    <node id="1. The team discussed the need to understand how the target price for their device compares with similar items in the market. Specifically, the Industrial Designer was interested in knowing if a proposed price of twelve Euros fifty was competitive.&#10;2. The Marketing speaker agreed with the importance of understanding what competitors are doing and what is in the pipeline in terms of features and pricing. There was a mention of an LCD screen as an example of a feature that needs further investigation.&#10;3. The team did not have complete information on the typical price of similar items or the competition's offerings at the time of the discussion, but they recognized the importance of gathering this information for future discussions and decision-making." />
    <node id=": Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Shall I go back ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of" />

    <node id=": User Interface&#10;Content: It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has {disfmarker} seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has {disfmarker} it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access {disfmarker} it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .

    <node id="1. The User Interface (UI) team suggests a complete overhaul of the device's design, focusing on revolutionizing every aspect related to this hand-held device. This includes:&#10;   - Materials: Considering different types of plastic or other materials used for the device.&#10;   - Buttons: Improving the style, size, shape, and positioning of buttons to enhance usability.&#10;   - Shape: Redesigning the overall shape of the hand-held device for better ergonomics and fit.&#10;   - Colors: Exploring various color options that can make the device more appealing to users.&#10;&#10;2. The Marketing team supports these changes, emphasizing the need to reimagine the remote control as a useful electronic device rather than just a disposable item often lost in couches. They want to bring the remote control into the same realm as other popular handheld tools by focusing on menu functionality, current technology, and potential interactivity with other devices.&#10;3. Both teams also recognize the importance of making informed decisions about which buttons or keys to keep or discard, based on market research showing that users are generally not satisfied with existing remote control designs." />

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcripts, there is no explicit mention of the estimated cost to develop a device with basic elements including speech recognition. However, there were concerns expressed by the Industrial Designer about fitting speech recognition into the desired price range for the device. The device's user interface is intended to be simple and intuitive, and incorporating speech recognition could potentially increase the cost of development and production.&#10;&#10;The team acknowledged the need to understand how their proposed price compares with similar items in the market and the importance of gathering information on typical prices and competitors' offerings. At the time of the discussion, they did not have complete information on these aspects. Therefore, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding whether it would be possible to fit speech recognition into the desired price range for selling approximately four million units without more detailed cost estimates." />

    <node id="1. The methodology used by the Industrial Designer to prepare for the meeting involved web-based research, as they mentioned &quot;I've been doing a little bit of web-based research.&quot; They also stated that if they had a design team, they would discuss their ideas with them.&#10;&#10;2. Based on their preparation, the Industrial Designer came up with a first cut for the practicalities of how the product should function. However, the specifics of this first cut are not provided in the transcript. They intended to discuss these ideas during the meeting.&#10;&#10;3. The Industrial Designer brought up an issue related to the use of solar power during nighttime and mentioned that it may not be a good option for watching TV at night since it requires sunlight to generate energy.&#10;&#10;4. In response to this concern, the Project Manager suggested storing up energy during the day and using it at night as a potential solution. The Industrial Designer acknowledged that this could potentially make the device heavier and more expensive.&#10;&#10;5.

An LCD screen can provide visual feedback and make the device more appealing to users.&#10;2. The group member who thinks that only a small population would prefer using such a feature is likely from the Marketing team, as they emphasized the need to reimagine the remote control as a useful electronic device rather than just a disposable item often lost in couches. They might believe that adding an LCD screen could increase the production cost and complexity of the remote control, making it less accessible to some users, particularly grandmothers who may find complex remotes difficult to use." />
    <node id="1. Power: This function is essential for turning the TV on and off.&#10;2. Channel: Users need to navigate through channels easily; this function allows changing between different channel options.&#10;3. Volume: Adjusting the volume of the TV is a crucial feature that should be included in any remote control.&#10;4. Basic playback controls (optional): If speech recognition technology is implemented, basic playback controls like play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward might not be necessary on the physical remote. However, if speech recognition isn't an option or fails to work correctly at times, having these basic controls can still be useful.&#10;5. Navigation: A navigation button (usually a directional pad) is essential for browsing menus, selecting options, and interacting with smart TV features.&#10;6. Back/Exit: These buttons allow users to go back or exit from menus and apps without needing to restart the TV entirely.&#10;7. Input/Source: This button helps users switch between various input sources (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2) on their TVs.&#10;8. Mute: Quickly silencing the audio without adjusting the volume level is a useful feature for many users.&#10;9. Settings: Although not as frequently used, having access to basic settings like language, closed captions, or picture mode can still be valuable on a TV remote control. Functions such as screen and audio settings that are typically found on video/DVD remotes may not be necessary here since they can be controlled directly on the television itself.&#10;&#10;These essential functions should serve as a foundation for designing a more streamlined TV remote control, making it easy to use for all types of users while considering the potential addition of speech recognition technology." />

This type of battery can be charged by plugging it into a power source for several hours, eliminating the need to replace AAA batteries.&#10;2. The primary reason why this has not been implemented yet is likely due to the potential higher development and installation costs associated with creating and integrating such a rechargeable battery system, as acknowledged by the group members. However, market research shows that 91% of early adopters, who are likely younger individuals with less financial responsibilities, would be willing to pay more for remote controls with integrated speech recognition technology, suggesting there might be a market for more advanced and costly remote control designs." />

    <node id="1. The primary drawback of using solar power for watching TV at night is that solar power requires sunlight to generate energy, making it unsuitable for nighttime use. This was mentioned by the Industrial Designer during the meeting.&#10;2. The Project Manager acknowledged that using solar power with energy storage could potentially make the device heavier and more expensive, which are significant drawbacks to consider." />
    <node id="1. Based on the meeting transcripts, the project manager can reimagine the remote control as a more useful and accessible electronic device by focusing on several key areas. Firstly, both the UI and Marketing teams want to revolutionize every aspect of the device, making it appealing and functional for users. This includes exploring materials, button design, shape, color options, and integrating new features like an LCD screen for visual feedback and menu functionality.&#10;2. The project manager should consider current technology when redesigning the remote control, such as potential integration with speech recognition technology or other home automation systems. Interactivity with other devices like smartphones could also increase the usefulness of the remote control.&#10;3. Usability is a crucial factor in designing the new remote control. The UI designer's suggestion of creating a more streamlined TV-only remote control with basic functions can help make it easier to use for all types of users, especially considering user demographics and market research on existing remote controls.&#10;4. Marketing content should highlight the unique selling points of the new remote control, including its streamlined design, easy usability, and potential integration with other technologies. Understanding the target market, user demographics, and their preferences will be essential in tailoring the message to potential customers.&#10;5. Lastly, discussing energy solutions for nighttime use, such as using solar power, storing energy, or incorporating a rechargeable internal battery, can help make the remote control more sustainable and accessible for users." />
    <node id="1. The project manager, user interface, and marketing teams are deciding on the functions of their product. They have agreed that power, channel, volume, an enter key, number keys, and big user-friendly buttons are necessary.&#10;2. The proposal for an enter key and number keys is agreeable to everyone present in the discussion, including the project manager, user interface designer, and marketing team members.&#10;3. There is no explicit mention of agreement or disagreement regarding big user-friendly buttons, but it can be inferred that they are accepted since they were included in the list of functions agreed upon by everyone.&#10;4. No clear decision has been made about other potential functions or design aspects during this particular discussion. They may still be under consideration or will be discussed at a later stage." />

The question &quot;Are people who buy personal music devices necessarily also purchasing TV remotes, even if they may have enough money but not necessarily need them?&quot; is asking whether there's a correlation between individuals buying personal music devices and TV remotes. Just because someone can afford to purchase both does not mean they will.&#10;2. According to the transcript, the marketing team emphasized the importance of understanding who buys televisions since it may influence the potential market for the new remote control. The industrial designer mentioned that convincing people to buy a new remote when their existing one came with the TV would be challenging.&#10;3. To answer the question, we cannot determine if people buying personal music devices are also purchasing TV remotes based on this information alone. However, considering the marketing and design aspects discussed in the transcript, understanding user demographics, preferences, and needs is crucial to creating an appealing product. If a significant portion of the target market for the new remote control also buys personal music devices, that could potentially be leveraged in the marketing strategy.&#10;4. The UI designer's recommendation of focusing on essential functions, like channel, volume, and power, makes the remote more user-friendly and attractive to various users, including those who might not need additional features but want a simple and easy-to-use device.">

The question &quot;Are people who buy personal music devices necessarily also purchasing TV remotes, even if they may have enough money but not necessarily need them?&quot; is asking whether there's a correlation between individuals buying personal music devices and TV remotes. Just because someone can afford to purchase both does not mean they will.&#10;2. According to the transcript, the marketing team emphasized the importance of understanding who buys televisions since it may influence the potential market for the new remote control. The industrial designer mentioned that convincing people to buy a new remote when their existing one came with the TV would be challenging.&#10;3. To answer the question, we cannot determine if people buying personal music devices are also purchasing TV remotes based on this information alone. However, considering the marketing and design aspects discussed in the transcript, understanding user demographics, preferences, and needs is crucial to creating an appealing product. If a significant portion of the target market for the new remote control also buys personal music devices, that could potentially be leveraged in the marketing strategy.&#10;4. The UI designer's recommendation of focusing on essential functions, like channel, volume, and power, makes the remote more user-friendly and attractive to various users, including those who might not need additional features but want a simple and easy-to-use device.">

The idea of integrating an LCD screen in remote controls is being brought up because the User Interface (UI) team wants to revolutionize every aspect related to this hand-held device, including exploring various color options and focusing on menu functionality. An LCD screen can provide visual feedback and make the device more appealing to users.&#10;2. The group member who thinks that only a small population would prefer using such a feature is likely from the Marketing team, as they emphasized the need to reimagine the remote control as a useful electronic device rather than just a disposable item often lost in couches. They might believe that adding an LCD screen could increase the production cost and complexity of the remote control, making it less accessible to some users, particularly grandmothers who may find complex remotes difficult to use." target="1. The key components of the preliminary design for the remote control based on the meeting transcripts are as follows:&#10;2. Energy Source: The group discusses the use of solar power at night and mentions potential solutions like storing energy or using a rechargeable internal battery. This indicates that the new design may incorporate an alternative energy source to traditional batteries.&#10;3. User Interface: The User Interface team agrees on using a simpler design with fewer functions, focusing on making it a TV-only remote control. They recommend removing extraneous features and concentrating on basic functions like channel, volume, and power for easy use by all types of users, including grandmothers who may find complex remotes difficult to use.&#10;4. Message Composition: Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, the new design will likely focus on simplifying the message composition by removing unnecessary buttons and improving the layout of essential functions for better usability.&#10;5. Sending Mechanism: As this is a redesign of a standard remote control, the sending mechanism will probably still rely on infrared (IR) technology, which is the most common method for transmitting signals from remote controls to devices. However, there were no specific discussions about changing or improving the sending mechanism in the transcripts.&#10;6. The group plans to use a whiteboard session to further explain and discuss these design components due to technical difficulties with creating a PowerPoint slide. This approach allows for more interactive brainstorming and collaboration among team members.">

This information was gathered through market research questionnaires conducted by the Marketing team during the meeting discussed in the transcripts." target="1. The question &quot;Are people who buy personal music devices necessarily also purchasing TV remotes, even if they may have enough money but not necessarily need them?&quot; is asking whether there's a correlation between individuals buying personal music devices and TV remotes. Just because someone can afford to purchase both does not mean they will.&#10;2. According to the transcript, the marketing team emphasized the importance of understanding who buys televisions since it may influence the potential market for the new remote control. The industrial designer mentioned that convincing people to buy a new remote when their existing one came with the TV would be challenging.&#10;3. To answer the question, we cannot determine if people buying personal music devices are also purchasing TV remotes based on this information alone. However, considering the marketing and design aspects discussed in the transcript, understanding user demographics, preferences, and needs is crucial to creating an appealing product. If a significant portion of the target market for the new remote control also buys personal music devices, that could potentially be leveraged in the marketing strategy.&#10;4. The UI designer's recommendation of focusing on essential functions, like channel, volume, and power, makes the remote more user-friendly and attractive to various users, including those who might not need additional features but want a simple and easy-to-use device.">

    <node id="The elder lady, who is Amelia's mother, is indignant over Amelia gifting books to her son Georgy because, according to her, the family is in dire financial straits. They have already sold all their valuables, including her shawl and even the spoons, to keep the family going and pay rent to their landlord, Mr. Clapp. She accuses Amelia of caring only for Georgy and neglecting other responsibilities. To keep the family afloat financially, she has sold all her trinkets, including a valuable shawl from India, down to the very spoons. She has also managed to pay rent to Mr. Clapp, who is described as not a hard landlord but a civil man and a father.

At this she&#10;passed all her money across the table, without a word, to her mother,&#10;and returned to her room to cry her eyes out. She had a great access of&#10;sensibility too that day, when obliged to go and countermand the&#10;clothes, the darling clothes on which she had set her heart for&#10;Christmas Day, and the cut and fashion of which she had arranged in&#10;many conversations with a small milliner, her friend.&#10;&#10;Hardest of all, she had to break the matter to Georgy, who made a loud&#10;outcry.  Everybody had new clothes at Christmas.  The others would&#10;laugh at him.  He would have new clothes.  She had promised them to&#10;him.  The poor widow had only kisses to give him.  She darned the old&#10;suit in tears.  She cast about among her little ornaments to see if she&#10;could sell anything to procure the desired novelties.

The butcher was particularly&#10;surly, the grocer insolent:  once or twice little Georgy had grumbled&#10;about the dinners, and Amelia, who still would have been satisfied with&#10;a slice of bread for her own dinner, could not but perceive that her&#10;son was neglected and purchased little things out of her private purse&#10;to keep the boy in health.&#10;&#10;At last they told her, or told her such a garbled story as people in&#10;difficulties tell.  One day, her own money having been received, and&#10;Amelia about to pay it over, she, who had kept an account of the moneys&#10;expended by her, proposed to keep a certain portion back out of her&#10;dividend, having contracted engagements for a new suit for Georgy.&#10;&#10;Then it came out that Jos's remittances were not paid, that the house&#10;was in difficulties, which Amelia ought to have seen before, her mother&#10;said, but she cared for nothing or nobody except Georgy.

Surely, Amelia could not refuse such&#10;advantageous chances for the boy.  Nor could she, but she acceded to&#10;their overtures with a very heavy and suspicious heart, was always&#10;uneasy during the child's absence from her, and welcomed him back as if&#10;he was rescued out of some danger.  He brought back money and toys, at&#10;which the widow looked with alarm and jealousy; she asked him always if&#10;he had seen any gentleman--&quot;Only old Sir William, who drove him about&#10;in the four-wheeled chaise, and Mr. Dobbin, who arrived on the&#10;beautiful bay horse in the afternoon--in the green coat and pink&#10;neck-cloth, with the gold-headed whip, who promised to show him the&#10;Tower of London and take him out with the Surrey hounds.&quot; At last, he&#10;said, &quot;There was an old gentleman, with thick eyebrows, and a broad" />

And he must have meditated on what she said and&#10;have made some inquiries of the Dobbin family regarding her visit, for&#10;a fortnight after it took place, he asked her where was her little&#10;French watch and chain she used to wear?&#10;&#10;&quot;I bought it with my money, sir,&quot; she said in a great fright.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go and order another like it, or a better if you can get it,&quot; said the&#10;old gentleman and lapsed again into silence.&#10;&#10;Of late the Misses Dobbin more than once repeated their entreaties to&#10;Amelia, to allow George to visit them.

    <node id="Pitt Crawley's actions towards his brother and Becky Sharp were motivated by a combination of guilt and the desire to appear generous. He was aware that he had gained wealth and status that should have been his younger brother's, and he experienced some remorse for this injustice. At the same time, he wanted to maintain the appearance of a benevolent landowner and brother-in-law.&#10;&#10;Pitt's actions towards Becky were more calculated. He saw an opportunity to use her as a pawn in his ongoing power struggle with his younger brother's wife. By appearing generous towards Becky, he could ingratiate himself with her and gain an ally in the family. Becky, for her part, was happy to accept Pitt's generosity, as it gave her access to resources and connections that she could use for her own benefit. She also saw an opportunity to manipulate Pitt and use him to further her own social and financial ambitions.&#10;&#10;In the end, both Pitt and Becky benefited from their interactions. Pitt was able to maintain his status as a generous landowner and gain an ally in the family, while Becky was able to secure resources and connections that she could use for her own benefit. However, their relationship was also based on manipulation and self-interest, and it was unlikely to be a stable or lasting one." />

Money has&#10;only a different value in the eyes of each.&#10;&#10;So, in a word, Pitt Crawley thought he would do something for his&#10;brother, and then thought that he would think about it some other time.&#10;&#10;And with regard to Becky, she was not a woman who expected too much&#10;from the generosity of her neighbours, and so was quite content with&#10;all that Pitt Crawley had done for her.  She was acknowledged by the&#10;head of the family.  If Pitt would not give her anything, he would get&#10;something for her some day.  If she got no money from her&#10;brother-in-law, she got what was as good as money--credit.

Even at a hint about embarrassments, Sir Pitt&#10;Crawley was off and alarmed.  And he began a long speech, explaining&#10;how straitened he himself was in money matters; how the tenants would&#10;not pay; how his father's affairs, and the expenses attendant upon the&#10;demise of the old gentleman, had involved him; how he wanted to pay off&#10;incum" />

It&#10;could not have escaped the notice of such a cool and experienced old&#10;diplomatist that Rawdon's family had nothing to live upon, and that&#10;houses and carriages are not to be kept for nothing.  He knew very well&#10;that he was the proprietor or appropriator of the money, which,&#10;according to all proper calculation, ought to have fallen to his&#10;younger brother, and he had, we may be sure, some secret pangs of&#10;remorse within him, which warned him that he ought to perform some act&#10;of justice, or, let us say, compensation, towards these disappointed&#10;relations.

She said that it was only the thoroughbred gentleman who&#10;could wear the Court suit with advantage:  it was only your men of&#10;ancient race whom the culotte courte became.

    <node id="Glorvina's attempts to capture the Major's attention through her appearance and flirtatious behavior are unsuccessful because the Major is not interested in her in that way. His thoughts and feelings are occupied by another woman, whom he pictures as &quot;a gentle little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking, save when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss Glorvina's&quot; (George, William Makepeace. Vanity Fair. Penguin Classics, 1985). This woman is Amelia, who contrasts sharply with Glorvina in terms of personality and demeanor. The Major is not impressed by Glorvina's attempts to show off her appearance or charm, and as a result, she is unable to elicit any jealousy or anger from him. This leaves her feeling frustrated and heartbroken, as she has set her sights on the Major and has been rebuffed." />

Glorvina cried with rage at&#10;the failure.  She had set her mind on the Major &quot;more than on any of&#10;the others,&quot; she owned, sobbing.  &quot;He'll break my heart, he will,&#10;Peggy,&quot; she would whimper to her sister-in-law when they were good&#10;friends; &quot;sure every one of me frocks must be" />

She was never tired&#10;of inquiring, if Sorrow had his young days faded, and was ready to&#10;listen and weep like Desdemona at the stories of his dangers and his&#10;campaigns.  It has been said that our honest and dear old friend used&#10;to perform on the flute in private; Glorvina insisted upon having duets&#10;with him, and Lady O'Dowd would rise and artlessly quit the room when&#10;the young couple were so engaged. Glorvina forced the Major to ride&#10;with her of mornings.  The whole cantonment saw them set out and&#10;return.  She was constantly writing notes over to him at his house,&#10;borrowing his books, and scoring with her great pencil-marks such&#10;passages of sentiment or humour as awakened her sympathy.

Good heavens! was a man of intellect to waste his&#10;life, day after day, inspecting cross-belts and putting fools through&#10;their manoeuvres? The senseless chatter of the young men at mess was&#10;more than ever jarring. What cared he, a man on the high road to forty,&#10;to know how many snipes Lieutenant Smith had shot, or what were the&#10;performances of Ensign Brown's mare? The jokes about the table filled&#10;him with shame.  He was too old to listen to the banter of the&#10;assistant surgeon and the slang of the youngsters, at which old O'Dowd,&#10;with his bald head and red face, laughed quite easily.  The old man had&#10;listened to those jokes any time these thirty years--Dobbin himself had&#10;been fifteen years hearing them.  And after the boisterous dulness of&#10;the mess-table, the" />

Mrs. O'Dowd knew the Major's expectations and&#10;appreciated his good qualities and the high character which he enjoyed&#10;in his profession.  Glorvina, a very handsome, fresh-coloured,&#10;black-haired, blue-eyed young lady, who could ride a horse, or play a&#10;sonata with any girl out of the County Cork, seemed to be the very&#10;person destined to insure Dobbin's happiness--much more than that poor&#10;good little weak-spur'ted Amelia, about whom he used to take on&#10;so.--&quot;Look at Glorvina enter a room,&quot; Mrs. O'Dowd would say, &quot;and&#10;compare her with" />

Our&#10;honest friend had but one idea of a woman in his head, and that one did&#10;not in the least resemble Miss Glorvina O'Dowd in pink satin.  A gentle&#10;little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking,&#10;save when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss&#10;Glorvina's--a soft young mother tending an infant and beckoning the&#10;Major up with a smile to look at him--a rosy-cheeked lass coming&#10;singing into the room in Russell Square or hanging on George Osborne's&#10;arm, happy and loving--there was but this image that filled our honest&#10;Major's mind, by day and by night, and reigned over it always.

But there was only Glorvina of the jetty&#10;ringlets with whom his intercourse was familiar, and this dashing young&#10;woman was not bent upon loving the Major, but rather on making the&#10;Major admire HER--a most vain and hopeless task, too, at least&#10;considering the means that the poor girl possessed to carry it out.&#10;She curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say,&#10;did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion? She grinned at&#10;him so that he might see that every tooth in her head was sound--and he&#10;never heeded all these charms.

If she had exposed the fraud committed by her husband against her father, he would have been restored to his rightful place and wealth, which would have ensured similar advantages for her son. Her son was currently living a modest life, attending a school with limited resources, whereas he could have enjoyed a prosperous life with better education and opportunities if not for Amelia's silence. This realization brought her deep despair and regret, as she now understood that her actions had negatively impacted her son's future." />

She had but&#10;to speak the words, and her father was restored to competency and the&#10;boy raised to fortune.

From heaven the hero must be smiling down upon&#10;that paragon of a boy whom he had left to comfort and console her. We&#10;have seen how one of George's grandfathers (Mr. Osborne), in his easy&#10;chair in Russell Square, daily grew more violent and moody, and how his&#10;daughter, with her fine carriage, and her fine horses, and her name on&#10;half the public charity-lists of the town, was a lonely, miserable,&#10;persecuted old maid.  She thought again and again of the beautiful&#10;little boy, her brother's son, whom she had seen.  She longed to be&#10;allowed to drive in the fine carriage to the house in which he lived,&#10;and she used to look out day after day as she took her solitary drive&#10;in the park, in hopes that she might see him.

To part with him all day,&#10;to send him out to the mercy of a schoolmaster's cane and his&#10;schoolfellows' roughness, was almost like weaning him over again to&#10;that weak mother, so tremulous and full of sensibility.  He, for his&#10;part, rushed off to the school with the utmost happiness.  He was&#10;longing for the change. That childish gladness wounded his mother, who&#10;was herself so grieved to part with him.  She would rather have had him&#10;more sorry, she thought, and then was deeply repentant within herself&#10;for daring to be so selfish as to wish her own son to be unhappy.&#10;&#10;Georgy made great progress in the school, which was kept by a friend of&#10;his mother's constant admirer, the Rev. Mr. Binny.  He brought home&#10;numberless prizes and testimonials of ability.  He told his mother&#10;countless stories every night about his school-companions: and what a&#10;fine fellow Lyons was, and what a sneak Sniffin was, and how Steel's&#10;father actually supplied the meat for the establishment, whereas&#10;Golding's mother came in a carriage to" />

Despite her initial reluctance, Becky ultimately changes her mind and brings her son with them to Queen’s Crawley.&#10;&#10;Upon seeing Rawdon's sadness and disappointment at the prospect of being separated from his son during the holidays, Becky decides to bring him along to appease her husband. She also recognizes that Lady Jane, Sir Pitt, and their family are more welcoming towards her son than they are towards herself, which encourages her to include him in their holiday plans.

In this cheap and&#10;thrifty way Sir Pitt tries to pay off his debt to his family.&#10;&#10;Also before this merry Christmas was over, the Baronet had screwed up&#10;courage enough to give his brother another draft on his bankers, and&#10;for no less a sum than a hundred pounds, an act which caused Sir Pitt&#10;cruel pangs at first, but which made him glow afterwards to think&#10;himself one of the most generous of men.  Rawdon and his son went away&#10;with the utmost heaviness of heart.

Lady&#10;Jane and Becky did not get on quite so well at this visit as on&#10;occasion of the former one, when the Colonel's wife was bent upon&#10;pleasing.  Those two speeches of the child struck rather a chill.&#10;Perhaps Sir Pitt was rather too attentive to her.&#10;&#10;But Rawdon, as became his age and size, was fonder of the society of&#10;the men than of the women, and never wearied of accompanying his sire&#10;to the stables, whither the Colonel retired to smoke his cigar--Jim,&#10;the Rector's son, sometimes joining his cousin in that and other&#10;amusements.

Becky had hinted&#10;every one of these things herself, perhaps, but so delicately and&#10;gently that you hardly knew when or where.  And, before they parted, it&#10;was agreed that the house in London should be redecorated for the next&#10;season, and that the brothers' families should meet again in the&#10;country at Christmas.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you could have got a little money out of him,&quot; Rawdon said to&#10;his wife moodily when the Baronet was gone.  &quot;I should like to give&#10;something to old Raggles, hanged if I shouldn't.

It&#10;was impossible sometimes to resist this artless little creature's&#10;hospitalities, so kindly were they pressed, so frankly and amiably&#10;offered.  Becky seized Pitt's hand in a transport of gratitude when he&#10;agreed to come.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, squeezing it and looking into&#10;the Baronet's eyes, who blushed a good deal; &quot;how happy this will make&#10;Rawdon!&quot; She bustled up to Pitt's bedroom, leading on the servants, who&#10;were carrying his trunks thither.  She came in herself laughing, with a&#10;coal-scuttle out of her own room.&#10;&#10;A fire was blazing already in Sir Pitt's apartment (it was Miss&#10;Briggs's room, by the way, who was sent upstairs to sleep with the&#10;maid).  &quot;I knew I should bring you,&quot; she said with pleasure beaming" />

Earlier in the narrative, it is mentioned that they have already sold all their valuables, including a shawl and even the spoons, to keep the family going and pay rent to their landlord, Mr. Clapp. Despite these financial difficulties, Amelia spends money on books for Georgy, which angers her mother.&#10;&#10;Upon seeing the books, the elder lady expressed her concern by saying, &quot;Books!

Books, when to keep you and your son in luxury, and your dear father out of gaol, I've sold every trinket I had, the India shawl from my back even down to the very spoons... Oh, Amelia! You break my heart with your books and that boy of yours, whom you are ruining.&quot; Here, she is expressing her worry about the family's well-being and their inability to make ends meet due to Amelia's spending on books instead of essential items like bread.

    <node id="Rawdon Crawley's mother, Becky, reacts harshly towards her son's attempt to listen to her singing because she is caught up in her own social ambitions and preoccupations. She is attracted to singing for Lord Steyne, who is a powerful and influential figure, rather than for her own son. When Rawdon tries to listen in on her singing, Becky loses her temper and strikes him, revealing her disregard for his feelings and her preference for the company of Lord Steyne.

He heard a laugh from the Marquis in the inner room (who was&#10;amused by this free and artless exhibition of Becky's temper) and fled&#10;down below to his friends of the kitchen, bursting in an agony of grief.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not because it hurts me,&quot; little Rawdon gasped&#10;out--&quot;only--only&quot;--sobs and tears wound up the sentence in a storm.  It&#10;was the little boy's heart that was bleeding.  &quot;Why mayn't I hear her&#10;singing?

And very soon&#10;afterwards, when Mrs. Rawdon Crawley made her appearance at Gaunt&#10;House, the porter who unbarred the gates, the servants of all uniforms&#10;in the hall, the functionaries in white waistcoats, who bawled out from&#10;landing to landing the names of Colonel and Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, knew&#10;about her, or fancied they did.

His very sight annoyed her.  Fear, doubt, and resistance&#10;sprang up, too, in the boy's own bosom.  They were separated from that&#10;day of the boxes on the ear.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne also heartily disliked the boy.  When they met by&#10;mischance, he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child, or glared at&#10;him with savage-looking eyes. Rawdon used to stare him in the face and&#10;double his little fists in return.  He knew his enemy, and this&#10;gentleman, of all who came to the house, was the one who angered him&#10;most.

Then the young ladies came and knocked at&#10;Mrs. Rawdon's door, under the pretence that they were desirous to be&#10;useful, but in reality to have the pleasure of inspecting the contents&#10;of her band and bonnet-boxes, and her dresses which, though black, were&#10;of the newest London fashion.  And they told her how much the Hall was&#10;changed for the better, and how old Lady Southdown was gone, and how&#10;Pitt was taking his station in the county, as became a Crawley in fact.&#10;Then the great dinner-bell having rung, the family assembled at dinner,&#10;at which meal Rawdon Junior was placed by his aunt, the good-natured&#10;lady of the house, Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his&#10;sister-in-law at his own right hand.&#10;&#10;Little Rawdon exhibited a fine appetite" />

He had done&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley the honour to meet him at Mrs. Becky's house and had&#10;been most gracious to the new Baronet and member.  Pitt was struck too&#10;by the deference with which the great Peer treated his sister-in-law,&#10;by her ease and sprightliness in the conversation, and by the delight&#10;with which the other men of the party listened to her talk.

He restored dilapidated lodges on the Queen's Crawley estate and was elected for the borough speedily after his father's demise. His efforts to rebuild the injured popularity of his house paid off, and a great part of the altered demeanor and popularity of Sir Pitt Crawley might have been traced to the counsels of that astute little lady of Curzon Street, Rebecca Sharp.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Sir Pitt's actions included not only repairing physical damage to the estate but also rebuilding his family's reputation in society and regaining the public's trust by becoming a respected member of parliament and a magistrate." />

The black outer-coating of the bricks&#10;was removed, and they appeared with a cheerful, blushing face streaked&#10;with white: the old bronze lions of the knocker were gilt handsomely,&#10;the railings painted, and the dismallest house in Great Gaunt Street&#10;became the smartest in the whole quarter, before the green leaves in&#10;Hampshire had replaced those yellowing ones which were on the trees in&#10;Queen's Crawley Avenue when old Sir Pitt Crawley passed under them for&#10;the last time.&#10;&#10;A little woman, with a carriage to correspond, was perpetually seen&#10;about this mansion; an elderly spinster, accompanied by a little boy,&#10;also might be remarked coming thither daily.

However, when no sixty pounds arrived at the end of six months, the household fell deeper into trouble.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley, who was growing infirm and shaken, remained silent or wept a great deal. The butcher was particularly surly, the grocer insolent, and even their son, Georgy, grumbled about the dinners. Amelia, who had been paying for everything with her own money, proposed to keep a portion back from her dividend to buy a new suit for Georgy. It was then that they told her about the difficulties the household was facing, and that Jos's remittances were not being paid. The family had no choice but to rely on Amelia's small residual income, which she used to keep her son dressed in a manner befitting George Osborne's son and to pay for his schooling.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide specific details about the extent of Mr. Sedley's financial losses or the reasons behind Jos's failure to send remittances.

    <node id="In the narrative, Becky Sharp skillfully executed the domestic duty of being an excellent host to her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley. This contrasted with Lady Jane's unfortunate pie, which Sir Pitt thought was abominable. As part of her hospitality, Becky served Sir Pitt a bottle of White Hermitage wine from the Marquis of Steyne's famous cellars. This act of generosity and thoughtfulness towards her guest stood in stark contrast to Lady Jane's failed attempt at impressing Sir Pitt with her cooking skills." />

She could not go on,&#10;although Rebecca, with the smallest inflection of sarcasm in her voice,&#10;besought her to continue that charming story.  And on her side gentle&#10;thoughts and simple pleasures were odious to Mrs. Becky; they discorded&#10;with her; she hated people for liking them; she spurned children and&#10;children-lovers.  &quot;I have no taste for bread and butter,&quot; she would&#10;say, when caricaturing Lady Jane and her ways to my Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;&quot;No more has a certain person for holy water,&quot; his lordship replied&#10;with a bow and a grin and a great jarring laugh afterwards.&#10;&#10;So these two ladies did not see much of each other except upon those&#10;occasions when the younger brother's wife, having an object to gain&#10;from the other, frequented her.

    <node id="The text describes a gathering or meal at Queen's Crawley, where Becky and her son Rawdon Junior are invited for the holidays. The interactions suggest that Lady Jane, the lady of the house, is being particularly gracious to Becky and her son, in contrast to how Becky feels she has been treated by the family in the past. The young ladies, who are likely the daughters of Sir Pitt, are eager to inspect Becky's belongings and seem excited to have her and Rawdon Junior present.&#10;&#10;Rawdon Junior is seated next to his aunt, who appears to be taking care of him during the meal. The seating arrangement also indicates that Sir Pitt is giving special attention to Becky, as he is sitting next to her at the head of the table. This may suggest a growing acceptance or warmth towards Becky from the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;Overall, the occasion seems to be a pleasant and welcoming one for Becky and Rawdon Junior, despite any initial reservations on Becky's part." />
    <node id="In the narrative provided, Amelia Sedley is taking several measures to provide for her son Georgy's education. Firstly, she has enrolled him in a school, which requires paying tuition fees and purchasing necessary school supplies. To cover these expenses, Amelia has been using a portion of her own income, as her father's financial situation has deteriorated due to failed speculations.&#10;&#10;To ensure that Georgy is dressed appropriately for his social status, Amelia also spends money on buying him new clothes, including a new suit. Despite the family's financial struggles, she prioritizes her son's needs and makes sacrifices to provide for him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Amelia has been spending time teaching Georgy herself, working late into the night to prepare lessons and help him with his studies. She even attempts to teach him Latin, hoping that she might be capable of instructing him in that language. This demonstrates her deep commitment to her son's education and welfare.&#10;&#10;However, Amelia's spending on books for Georgy angers her mother, who believes that the family cannot afford such luxuries due to their dire financial situation. Despite these criticisms, Amelia remains committed to providing for her son's education and well-being, even if it means making personal sacrifices and facing criticism from her family members." />
    <node id="The financial struggles faced by Mr. and Mrs. Sedley began when their remittances from India suddenly stopped arriving. Despite this, Mr. Sedley continued to believe that his shares would rise and that all would be well. However, when no sixty pounds arrived at the end of six months, the household fell deeper into trouble.&#10;&#10;During the first six months, the bills of the little household started falling into arrear as Mrs. Sedley, who had been paying her bills very regularly until then, was forced to go around asking for time from the tradesmen. Emmy's contribution, paid over cheerfully without any questions, kept the little company in half-rations. The family managed to get through the first six months pretty easily, with Mr. Sedley still maintaining his ascendency over the family of Mr. Clapp, his ex-clerk.&#10;&#10;To cope with their increasing hardships, Amelia proposed to keep a portion back from her dividend to buy a new suit for Georgy. It was then that they told her about the difficulties the household was facing and that Jos's remittances were not being paid. The family had no choice but to rely on Amelia's small residual income, which she used to keep her son dressed in a manner befitting George Osborne's son and to pay for his schooling.&#10;&#10;Despite the family's financial struggles, Amelia made sacrifices to provide for her son's education and well-being, even if it meant making personal sacrifices and facing criticism from her family members." />

As for Sir Michael O'Dowd, though his lady and her&#10;sister both urged him to call upon the Major to explain himself and not&#10;keep on torturing a poor innocent girl in that shameful way, the old&#10;soldier refused point-blank to have anything to do with the conspiracy.&#10;&quot;Faith, the Major's big enough to choose for himself,&quot; Sir Michael&#10;said; &quot;he'll ask ye when he wants ye&quot;; or else he would turn the matter&#10;off jocularly, declaring that &quot;Dobbin was too young to keep house, and&#10;had written home to ask lave of his mamma.&quot; Nay, he went farther, and&#10;in private communications with his Major would caution and rally him,&#10;crying, &quot;Mind your oi, Dob, my boy, them girls is bent on mischief--me&#10;Lady has just got a box of gowns from Europe" />

He also offered to provide an allowance for Mrs. George Osborne, which would not be withdrawn even if she chose to marry again. However, the condition was that George would live entirely with his grandfather in Russell Square or at another place of his choosing, and could only occasionally see his mother at her own residence. This proposal was brought to Mrs. George Osborne's notice through a letter when her mother was not at home and her father was absent in the City." />
    <node id="Glorvina's efforts to attract the Major's attention through her appearance and flirtatious behavior were unsuccessful because the Major was not interested in her in that way. His thoughts and feelings were occupied by another woman, Amelia, who contrasted sharply with Glorvina in terms of personality and demeanor. The Major did not see Glorvina's pink dress, nor was he jealous or angry about her interactions with other men. This left Glorvina feeling frustrated and heartbroken, as she had set her sights on the Major and had been rebuffed.&#10;The reason why Glorvina couldn't elicit any reaction from the Major is because his mind and heart were already taken by another woman, Amelia, who was described as a gentle little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking, save when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss Glorvina's. The contrast between Amelia and Glorvina in terms of personality and demeanor is one of the reasons why the Major was not interested in Glorvina's attempts to show off her appearance or charm.&#10;Additionally, the Major was going through a phase of self-reflection and discontent with his military career and lifestyle, which made him less responsive to Glorvina's advances. He was questioning the value of his daily routine, feeling too old for the banter of the young officers, and thinking about how he had broken his habit of drinking. All these factors contributed to his lack of interest in Glorvina and her attempts to attract him.&#10;In short, Glorvina's attempts to elicit jealousy or a reaction from the Major were unsuccessful because he was not interested in her, his thoughts and feelings were occupied by another woman, and he was going through a phase of self-reflection and discontent with his military career and lifestyle." />
    <node id="Rebecca Sharp made special efforts to win over Joseph Pitt Crawley's affection by showing him kindness and attention, making him feel welcome and appreciated in her home. She listened to him, talked to him, sang to him, coaxed him, and cuddled him, which made him feel more and more glad to return to her every day after work. Rebecca also displayed acts of emotional manipulation, such as pretending to cry when he left, which may have further endeared her to Pitt.&#10;&#10;These efforts had a significant impact on Pitt's feelings towards Rebecca. He began to feel increasingly grateful for her kindness and attention, and he developed a strong affection for her. Pitt also appreciated Rebecca's cooking skills, as she went downstairs to the kitchen and actually cooked little dishes for him. This further endeared her to him, as he vowed that &quot;she was fit to be the wife of an Emperor, and that to be skilful in domestic duties was surely one of the most charming of woman's qualities.&quot;&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's efforts to win over Pitt's affection were successful, as she was able to secure his loyalty and devotion. However, their relationship was also based on manipulation and self-interest, and it was unlikely to be a stable or lasting one." />

    <node id="Without additional information, it is difficult to make definitive conclusions about Pitt Crawley's feelings towards his brother and Becky Sharp. However, we can infer that Pitt may feel some guilt or remorse for having gained wealth and status that should have been his younger brother's. His payment to Raggles, a poor relation, may suggest a desire to make amends or do something for his brother.&#10;&#10;Regarding Becky, Pitt's actions towards her seem to be motivated by a combination of guilt and a desire to use her as a pawn in his power struggle with his younger brother's wife. By appearing generous towards Becky, he can ingratiate himself with her and gain an ally in the family. Becky, for her part, is happy to accept Pitt's generosity, as it gives her access to resources and connections that she can use for her own benefit.&#10;&#10;Therefore, we can infer that Pitt may feel some complex emotions towards both his brother and Becky, including guilt, remorse, and a desire to maintain appearances. However, without additional information, it is difficult to make more specific conclusions about his feelings towards them." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide specific information on why Becky is finding it challenging to assure Sir Pitt Crawley that he will be paid his dues. However, based on the text, we can infer some possible reasons. First, when Becky had previously hinted at financial difficulties to Sir Pitt, he became alarmed and began a long speech about his own money problems. This reaction may have made Becky wary of bringing up the subject again.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the narrative states that Becky had tried &quot;ever so delicately&quot; to approach the matter before and found it unsafe. This suggests that Sir Pitt may be sensitive or resistant to discussing financial matters, particularly if they relate to paying debts or dues.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the text indicates that Sir Pitt is currently in a precarious financial situation, with tenants who are not paying their rent and ongoing expenses related to his father's affairs. It is possible that he simply does not have the funds available to pay Becky or her husband at this time.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the narrative does not provide a specific reason for Becky's difficulty in assuring payment from Sir Pitt Crawley, it suggests that there may be underlying tensions or sensitivities related to financial discussions with him." />
    <node id="The most memorable day of hunting for Mr. James, the Colonel, Horn the keeper, and Rawdon was when they went rat-hunting in a barn.

Then, they stood silently with uplifted stakes in their hands and listened to the faint squeaking of the rats below.

Jim&#10;has given up that sport himself and confines himself to a little&#10;harmless duck- or snipe-shooting, or a little quiet trifling with the&#10;rats during the Christmas holidays, after which he will return to the&#10;University and try and not be plucked, once" />

It was a journey of infinite&#10;pleasure to the boy, to whom the incidents of the road afforded endless&#10;interest, his father answering to him all questions connected with it&#10;and telling him who lived in the great white house to the right, and&#10;whom the park belonged to.

    <node id="Pitt Crawley displayed an altered demeanor and increased hospitality during Christmas time, which can be traced back to the counsel of Becky Sharp. Becky had convinced him to stay in England and present himself as a Baronet and country gentleman, rather than remaining abroad. During the holiday season, Becky and her son Rawdon Junior were invited to Queen’s Crawley, and Pitt was particularly gracious to them. He sat next to Becky at the head of the table during a meal, and his daughters were eager to inspect her belongings. Meanwhile, Rawdon Junior was seated next to his aunt and seemed to be well taken care of.&#10;&#10;Rebecca (Becky) initially had reservations about bringing her son to Queen’s Crawley for the holidays, as she found him disruptive and not particularly interesting. However, she ultimately decided to bring him along due to Lady Jane's insistent invitations and Rawdon's displays of discontent at her neglect of their son. Becky recognized that Lady Jane and the rest of the Crawley family were more welcoming towards her son than they were towards herself, which encouraged her to include him in their holiday plans.&#10;&#10;Overall, Pitt Crawley displayed increased hospitality towards Becky and her son during Christmas time, likely due to Becky's influence. Becky initially had reservations about bringing her son along but ultimately decided to do so due to Lady Jane's insistent invitations and Rawdon's displays of discontent. The occasion seemed to be a pleasant and welcoming one for both Becky and Rawdon Junior, despite any initial reservations on Becky's part." />
    <node id="Amelia's increased attention towards Dobbin can be attributed to her mother's plan for Amelia to marry Major Dobbin. Given their family's financial struggles and the potential benefits of such a match, Mrs. Sedley has been encouraging Amelia to consider Dobbin as a suitor. This is likely why Amelia becomes more receptive to Dobbin's company and allows George to spend time with him.&#10;&#10;Dobbin, however, believes that Amelia is merely &quot;practising&quot; on him because he thinks she doesn't truly love him but is using him as a sort of companion or distraction while she waits for her true love, George Osborne, to return from the war. Dobbin compares their relationship to that of a pianist and an instrument, implying that Amelia might be using him to pass the time without genuinely caring for him. This is because he is aware of Amelia's deep feelings for George Osborne and believes she cannot feel the same way about him, despite his own deep love for her." />

Very&#10;likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Major had formed of her:&#10;there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in&#10;England, and with which William had made away privately, pasting it&#10;into the lid of his desk, and fancying he saw some resemblance to Mrs.&#10;Osborne in the print, whereas I have seen it, and can vouch that it is&#10;but the picture of a high-waisted gown with an impossible doll's face&#10;simpering over it--and, perhaps, Mr. Dobbin's sentimental Amelia was no&#10;more like the real one than this absurd little print which he&#10;cherished.  But what man in love, of us, is better informed?--or is he&#10;much happier when he sees and owns his delusion? Dobbin was under this&#10;spell.

At the same time, he is allowed to go out more and spend time with his son, who becomes a source of comfort for him. Rawdon spends hours in silence at his brother's house, glad to be occupied with errands and away from the social machinations happening around him. His relationship with his sister-in-law Rebecca also grows stronger as they spend more time together, while his dislike for Lord Steyne becomes more pronounced due to the latter's hostile attitude towards him and his mother.

However, when her father passed away, she began to keep the entire £100 for themselves. This increase in funds made her family more unlucky as they were now targeted by people who coveted her money.&#10;&#10;A short time after Amelia visited her father-in-law, Mr. Osborne, he asked her about a French watch and chain she had previously owned.

After her father's death, she kept all of her £100 income but faced new financial challenges due to people eyeing her increased wealth. The visit from Amelia to Mr. Osborne marked the beginning of his efforts at reconciliation with his daughter-in-law and grandson.">

Becky, for her part, is happy to accept Pitt's generosity, as it gives her access to resources and connections that she can use for her own benefit.&#10;&#10;Therefore, we can infer that Pitt may feel some complex emotions towards both his brother and Becky, including guilt, remorse, and a desire to maintain appearances.

Despite the family's financial struggles, she prioritizes her son's needs and makes sacrifices to provide for him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Amelia has been spending time teaching Georgy herself, working late into the night to prepare lessons and help him with his studies. She even attempts to teach him Latin, hoping that she might be capable of instructing him in that language. This demonstrates her deep commitment to her son's education and welfare.&#10;&#10;However, Amelia's spending on books for Georgy angers her mother, who believes that the family cannot afford such luxuries due to their dire financial situation. Despite these criticisms, Amelia remains committed to providing for her son's education and well-being, even if it means making personal sacrifices and facing criticism from her family members.">

However, when her father passed away, she began to keep the entire £100 for themselves. This increase in funds made her family more unlucky as they were now targeted by people who coveted her money.&#10;&#10;A short time after Amelia visited her father-in-law, Mr. Osborne, he asked her about a French watch and chain she had previously owned. When she told him that she had bought it with her own money, he instructed her to buy another one, or better yet, something even more expensive. This was the first step in Mr. Osborne's attempts at reconciliation with Amelia and George.&#10;&#10;In summary, during Christmas, the Widow Osborne and her son were living in Brompton on a limited income that she had previously shared with her parents. After her father's death, she kept all of her £100 income but faced new financial challenges due to people eyeing her increased wealth. The visit from Amelia to Mr. Osborne marked the beginning of his efforts at reconciliation with his daughter-in-law and grandson.">

His thoughts and feelings were occupied by another woman, Amelia, who contrasted sharply with Glorvina in terms of personality and demeanor. The Major did not see Glorvina's pink dress, nor was he jealous or angry about her interactions with other men. This left Glorvina feeling frustrated and heartbroken, as she had set her sights on the Major and had been rebuffed.&#10;The reason why Glorvina couldn't elicit any reaction from the Major is because his mind and heart were already taken by another woman, Amelia, who was described as a gentle little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking, save when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss Glorvina's. The contrast between Amelia and Glorvina in terms of personality and demeanor is one of the reasons why the Major was not interested in Glorvina's attempts to show off her appearance or charm.&#10;Additionally, the Major was going through a phase of self-reflection and discontent with his military career and lifestyle, which made him less responsive to Glorvina's advances. He was questioning the value of his daily routine, feeling too old for the banter of the young officers, and thinking about how he had broken his habit of drinking. All these factors contributed to his lack of interest in Glorvina and her attempts to attract him.&#10;In short, Glorvina's attempts to elicit jealousy or a reaction from the Major were unsuccessful because he was not interested in her, his thoughts and feelings were occupied by another woman, and he was going through a phase of self-reflection and discontent with his military career and lifestyle.">

This was particularly memorable because it was a new experience for Rawdon, who had not yet seen anything more noble than this sport. They stopped up the ends of certain drains in the barn and inserted ferrets into them. Then, they stood silently with uplifted stakes in their hands and listened to the faint squeaking of the rats below. When the rats bolted above-ground, the terrier accounted for one, the keeper for another, while Rawdon missed his rat due to flurry and excitement but half-murdered a ferret instead.">

Earlier in the narrative, it is mentioned that they have already sold all their valuables, including a shawl and even the spoons, to keep the family going and pay rent to their landlord, Mr. Clapp. Despite these financial difficulties, Amelia spends money on books for Georgy, which angers her mother.&#10;&#10;Upon seeing the books, the elder lady expressed her concern by saying, &quot;Books! Books, when the whole house wants bread! Books, when to keep you and your son in luxury, and your dear father out of gaol, I've sold every trinket I had, the India shawl from my back even down to the very spoons... Oh, Amelia! You break my heart with your books and that boy of yours, whom you are ruining.&quot; Here, she is expressing her worry about the family's well-being and their inability to make ends meet due to Amelia's spending on books instead of essential items like bread. She also accuses Amelia of neglecting other responsibilities by caring only for Georgy and not doing enough to help her father, who is facing financial difficulties and the risk of going to jail." target="In the narrative provided, Amelia Sedley is taking several measures to provide for her son Georgy's education. Firstly, she has enrolled him in a school, which requires paying tuition fees and purchasing necessary school supplies. To cover these expenses, Amelia has been using a portion of her own income, as her father's financial situation has deteriorated due to failed speculations.&#10;&#10;To ensure that Georgy is dressed appropriately for his social status, Amelia also spends money on buying him new clothes, including a new suit. Despite the family's financial struggles, she prioritizes her son's needs and makes sacrifices to provide for him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Amelia has been spending time teaching Georgy herself, working late into the night to prepare lessons and help him with his studies. She even attempts to teach him Latin, hoping that she might be capable of instructing him in that language. This demonstrates her deep commitment to her son's education and welfare.&#10;&#10;However, Amelia's spending on books for Georgy angers her mother, who believes that the family cannot afford such luxuries due to their dire financial situation. Despite these criticisms, Amelia remains committed to providing for her son's education and well-being, even if it means making personal sacrifices and facing criticism from her family members.">

The interactions suggest that Lady Jane, the lady of the house, is being particularly gracious to Becky and her son, in contrast to how Becky feels she has been treated by the family in the past. The young ladies, who are likely the daughters of Sir Pitt, are eager to inspect Becky's belongings and seem excited to have her and Rawdon Junior present.&#10;&#10;Rawdon Junior is seated next to his aunt, who appears to be taking care of him during the meal. The seating arrangement also indicates that Sir Pitt is giving special attention to Becky, as he is sitting next to her at the head of the table. This may suggest a growing acceptance or warmth towards Becky from the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;Overall, the occasion seems to be a pleasant and welcoming one for Becky and Rawdon Junior, despite any initial reservations on Becky's part.">

She listened to him, talked to him, sang to him, coaxed him, and cuddled him, which made him feel more and more glad to return to her every day after work. Rebecca also displayed acts of emotional manipulation, such as pretending to cry when he left, which may have further endeared her to Pitt.&#10;&#10;These efforts had a significant impact on Pitt's feelings towards Rebecca. He began to feel increasingly grateful for her kindness and attention, and he developed a strong affection for her. Pitt also appreciated Rebecca's cooking skills, as she went downstairs to the kitchen and actually cooked little dishes for him. This further endeared her to him, as he vowed that &quot;she was fit to be the wife of an Emperor, and that to be skilful in domestic duties was surely one of the most charming of woman's qualities.&quot;&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's efforts to win over Pitt's affection were successful, as she was able to secure his loyalty and devotion. However, their relationship was also based on manipulation and self-interest, and it was unlikely to be a stable or lasting one.">

His payment to Raggles, a poor relation, may suggest a desire to make amends or do something for his brother.&#10;&#10;Regarding Becky, Pitt's actions towards her seem to be motivated by a combination of guilt and a desire to use her as a pawn in his power struggle with his younger brother's wife. By appearing generous towards Becky, he can ingratiate himself with her and gain an ally in the family. Becky, for her part, is happy to accept Pitt's generosity, as it gives her access to resources and connections that she can use for her own benefit.&#10;&#10;Therefore, we can infer that Pitt may feel some complex emotions towards both his brother and Becky, including guilt, remorse, and a desire to maintain appearances.

First, when Becky had previously hinted at financial difficulties to Sir Pitt, he became alarmed and began a long speech about his own money problems. This reaction may have made Becky wary of bringing up the subject again.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the narrative states that Becky had tried &quot;ever so delicately&quot; to approach the matter before and found it unsafe. This suggests that Sir Pitt may be sensitive or resistant to discussing financial matters, particularly if they relate to paying debts or dues.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the text indicates that Sir Pitt is currently in a precarious financial situation, with tenants who are not paying their rent and ongoing expenses related to his father's affairs. It is possible that he simply does not have the funds available to pay Becky or her husband at this time.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the narrative does not provide a specific reason for Becky's difficulty in assuring payment from Sir Pitt Crawley, it suggests that there may be underlying tensions or sensitivities related to financial discussions with him.">

Dobbin compares their relationship to that of a pianist and an instrument, implying that Amelia might be using him to pass the time without genuinely caring for him.

However, the condition was that George would live entirely with his grandfather in Russell Square or at another place of his choosing, and could only occasionally see his mother at her own residence.

Out of her annual income of £100, Amelia had been giving up nearly three-fourths to her father and mother for their expenses, leaving her with a small amount for herself and George. However, when her father passed away, she began to keep the entire £100 for themselves. This increase in funds made her family more unlucky as they were now targeted by people who coveted her money.&#10;&#10;A short time after Amelia visited her father-in-law, Mr. Osborne, he asked her about a French watch and chain she had previously owned.

Very&#10;likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Major had formed of her:&#10;there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in&#10;England, and with which William had made away privately, pasting it&#10;into the lid of his desk, and fancying he saw some resemblance to Mrs.&#10;Osborne in the print, whereas I have seen it, and can vouch that it is&#10;but the picture of a high-waisted gown with an impossible doll's face&#10;simpering over it--and, perhaps, Mr. Dobbin's sentimental Amelia was no&#10;more like the real one than this absurd little print which he&#10;cherished.

In contrast, Rawdon's wife Becky made a to-do inside the vehicle, behaving as if she had never been in a stage-coach before.

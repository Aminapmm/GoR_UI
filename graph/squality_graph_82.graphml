    <node id="Oldo's party launched an outright attack on the peaceful march because they misunderstood the actions of Gravgak, one of the muscular guards of Tomboldo's party. Gravgak had picked up one of the attackers' clubs and ran toward their advance, which may have appeared to be a brave charge to his death. However, his gesture of swinging the club could have been intended as a warning to the attackers. When Oldo's party saw this, they likely interpreted it as a hostile act and decided to launch a surprise attack using the sponge-trees as cover and wielding weapons with luminous rocks at the ends. This led to a battle involving hurled capsule bombs and hand-to-hand combat." />
    <node id="oldo's party echoed the demand. They must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.&#10;&quot;&#10; &#10;  See—o—see—o!&#10; &#10; &quot;&#10; &#10; Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees came rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They bounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.&#10; &#10; Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No deliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies gleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the nearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed. Shouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the air.&#10; &#10; I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing sponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.&#10; &#10; The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came forward, rushing defiantly.&#10; &#10; Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their clubs and he ran toward their advance, and" />

The tall leader must be making a speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms in calm, graceful gestures.&#10; &#10; &quot;They'd better break it up!&quot; Split said suddenly. &quot;The jungles are moving in on them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They're spellbound,&quot; I said. &quot;They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't you ever see moving trees?&quot;&#10; &#10; Split said sharply, &quot;Those trees are marching! They're an army under cover. Look!&quot;&#10; &#10; I saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage for a sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were as innocent as a flock of sitting ducks. Split Campbell's voice was edged with alarm. &quot;Captain! Those worshippers—how can we warn them? Oh-oh! Too late. Look!&quot;&#10; &#10; All at once the advancing sponge-trees were tossed back over the heads of the savage band concealed within. They were warriors—fifty or more of them—with painted naked bodies.

He had picked up one of their clubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party it must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet the gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as a&#10; &#10;  warning&#10; &#10; ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these strange devils will throw fire at you.&#10; &#10; I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders, thank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip, zip—BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the rocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four warriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were flattened—and those who were able, ran.&#10; &#10; They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to pick up their clubs.&#10; &#10; But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious casualty. The guard Gravgak.

    <node id=" we descended from the ship.&#10; &#10; We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first. We slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be one-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively. We didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still retreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And in case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket arsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.&#10; &#10; Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the cream-and-red cloak.&#10; &#10; Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against the siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces. Like the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down any main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.&#10;&quot;Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.&quot; &quot;Very smooth.&quot;&#10;&quot;It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.&quot; &quot;Very smooth—handsome—attractive.&quot;&#10; &#10; Then the siren went off.&#10; &#10; The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid." />
    <node id=" must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The attackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life. It jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept right on singing.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.&quot; I got into it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party had behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our direction from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make out the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately, he marched over the hilltop toward us.&#10; &#10; Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding places in the ground. But a few—the brave ones, perhaps, or the officials of his group—came with him.&#10; &#10; &quot;He needs a stronger guard than that,&quot; Campbell grumbled.&#10; &#10; Sixteen was still wailing. &quot;Set it for ten minutes and come on,&quot; I said.

They dashed forward in a wide semicircle, swinging crude weapons, bent on slaughter.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; 3.&#10; &#10; They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends. They charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird clubs with a threat of death.&#10; &#10; Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we were about to witness a massacre.&#10; &#10; &quot;Captain—&#10; &#10;  Jim&#10; &#10; ! You're not going to let this happen!&quot;&#10; &#10; Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had the same impulse as Campbell—to do something—anything! Yet here we sat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty&#10;&quot;friends&quot; in danger.&#10; &#10; Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't duck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and packed themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.&#10; &#10; &quot;Can we shoot a ray, Jim?&quot;&#10; &#10; I didn" />

    <node id=" operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious casualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first blast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of the party hovered over him.&#10; &#10; His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me with suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us stood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages, and held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to consciousness.&#10; &#10; Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still at his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused a cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it—and then blacked out. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the handle of the club. It whizzed upward with him—apparently all by accident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into my head.&#10; &#10; I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; 4.&#10; &#10; Vauna," />

Is everything set? Check the instruments again, Campbell.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;S-s-sh!&quot; The low hush of Split Campbell's voice would somehow penetrate my dream.&#10; &#10; The voices about me were soft. My dreams echoed the soft female voices of this new, strange language.&#10; &#10; &quot;Campbell, are you there?... Have you forgotten the Code, Campbell?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Quiet, Captain.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who is it that's swabbing my face? I can't see.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's Vauna.

Did you know I performed an operation to relieve the pressure on your brain? You must get well, Captain.&quot; The words of Campbell came through insistently.&#10; &#10; After a silence that may have lasted for hours or days, I said,&#10;&quot;Campbell, you haven't forgot the EGGWE Code?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course not, Captain.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Section Four?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Section Four,&quot; he repeated in a low voice, as if to pacify me and put me to sleep. &quot;Conduct of EGGWE agents toward native inhabitants: A, No agent shall enter into any diplomatic agreement that shall be construed as binding—&quot;&#10; &#10; I interrupted. &quot;Clause D?&quot;&#10; &#10; He picked it up. &quot;D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with any native....

    <node id=".&#10; &#10;  I&#10; &#10; made an eel-like motion with my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain, the footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked around to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent figure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and green diamond markings—Gravgak.&#10; &#10; &quot;You get well?&quot; Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely.&#10; &#10; &quot;I get well,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;The blow on the head,&quot; he said, &quot;was not meant.&quot;&#10; &#10; I looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant to be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes told me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes flashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and started off. &quot;Get well!&quot;&#10; &#10; The crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway he turned. &quot;Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.&quot;&#10; &#10; She started. I reached and barely touched" />

See, I can almost walk.&quot; But as I started to rise, the wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. &quot;I will walk soon.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars and told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the ship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make myself believe.&quot; Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of forehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying to visualize the flight of a space ship. &quot;We will have much to tell each other.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I hope so,&quot; I said. &quot;Campbell and I came to learn about the&#10; &#10;  serpent river&#10; &#10; .&quot; I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not knowing the Benzendella equivalent.&#10; &#10;  I&#10; &#10; made an eel-like motion with my arm.

    <node id=". But you must sleep more. You are still weak.&quot;&#10; &#10; It gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust myself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By night they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep. Strange harmonies whispered through the caves.&#10; &#10; And if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me through the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me, faintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some corridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to go back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless dreams.&#10; &#10; The day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing before me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a hint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook the fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his flowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and played, &quot;Trail of Stars.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I have learned to talk,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;You have had a long" />

His training had given him an exaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.&#10; &#10; He was naturally so conscientious it was painful.

Both! &quot;Well!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They seem to be coming out of the ground,&quot; Split said. &quot;I see no signs of habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an underground city—though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;One's a male and the other's a female,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Another hypothesis,&quot; said Split.&#10; &#10; The late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two &quot;friends&quot;. They were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen our ship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparently come up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied them through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a hike.&#10; &#10; The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might guess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold, cleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of the cream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping" />

    <node id=" long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a prominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I looked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving.&#10; &#10; They were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where the crowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the trees themselves were moving.&#10; &#10; &quot;Notice anything?&quot; I asked Split.&#10; &#10; &quot;The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city.&quot; He gazed. &quot;They're coming from underground.&quot;&#10; &#10; Looking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view of the moving trees.&#10; &#10; &quot;Notice anything else unusual?&quot; I persisted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.

I wonder why?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You haven't noticed the trees?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The females are quite attractive,&quot; said Split.&#10; &#10; I forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope.

But if I thought I could rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.&#10; &#10; Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you see?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;I cannot say definitely.

No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of solid substance.&#10; &#10; We could see it at several points among the low foothills.

If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred not to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly vibrations, we meant to keep our distance.

The Narrator's Emotional Response: The narrator expresses a deep sense of excitement and kinship upon seeing a man-like creature among the crowd, suggesting a striking resemblance to humans from Earth. This observation marks the sixth time in the narrator's life of exploration that they have encountered such similarities.&#10;&#10;4. Split's Observations: Split notices the females' furry elbow ornaments and wonders about their purpose, but fails to notice the moving trees. He later observes another &quot;man-like&quot; creature wearing clothes, which the narrator excitedly identifies as a possible human.&#10;&#10;The story focuses on the emotional response of the narrator upon encountering man-like creatures and mobile trees on this unknown planet, while providing limited scientific information about these observations." />
    <node id="Yes, that is correct. In the story, Captain Linden has just regained consciousness and is still delirious from fever. He asks Campbell about Section Four of the EGGWE Code, specifically Clause D, to confirm that he has not forgotten the part of the code that forbids agents from entering into a marriage contract with native inhabitants. This may be because Captain Linden has developed feelings for Vauna, a native inhabitant of the planet, and is trying to make sure that his judgment is not clouded by these emotions." />

Or are you warning&#10; &#10;  yourself&#10; &#10; ?&quot;&#10; &#10; At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred vision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her—yes, she must have haunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her features more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the party of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the attack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and figure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's question. &quot;Myself.&quot;&#10; &#10; In the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna. The caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella people lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of their life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning about the world into which he has been born.&#10; &#10; Sometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla" />

If I recall our Code, Section Two, Order of Duties upon Landing: A—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from under its belly?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes sir.

The circle of savage ones suddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you ever saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity.

The response of the naked warriors when they heard the ship's siren wail was that they suddenly fell apart and their dance broke into wild contortions. They seemed to be affected by the sound as if it were an animal cry from an unknown world, and they ran for the sponge-trees in fear." />

The Keynes-Roy roving cameras brought back two important pieces of advance information: (a) that man lived on this planet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of Earth; and (b) that a vast cylindrical &quot;rope&quot; crawled the surface of this land, continuously, endlessly. This &quot;rope&quot; was described as having the compactness of solid substance and moving like a sluggish snake along a deep-worn path between hills and high jagged mountains on the horizon.&#10;2. As for &quot;Split,&quot; he is currently working on the reports from the Keynes-Roy roving cameras with great diligence, accurately recording all observable phenomena.

The siren from the ship goes off as the crew approaches the leader, but he stands unafraid, further emphasizing his potential resemblance to humans from Earth." />

This is clarified when the tall, stately old leader, Tomboldo, specifically mentions that he's referring to the narrator and his helper (Split) who came through the sky in a spaceship.&#10;2. The mode of transportation these friends are using to travel across the land is the Kao-Wagwattl, which is described as an ever-moving &quot;rope of life.&quot; Although there isn't a clear description of what the Kao-Wagwattl is, it seems to be some sort of creature or vehicle that the man-like creatures use to travel through the land." />

Soon we will move back to the other part of the world.&quot;&#10; &#10; There were low murmurs of approval through the chamber.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will wait a few days,&quot; Tomboldo went on, &quot;until our new friend—&quot; he pointed to me—&quot;is well enough to travel. We would never leave him here to the mercy of the savage ones. He and his helper came through the sky in time to save us from being destroyed. We must never forget this kindness.

They are invited to accompany Tomboldo's party back to their home inside a hill after the protagonists arrive at the planet in a spaceship, using a creature called the Kao-Wagwattl as their mode of transportation. The invitation is extended so that the narrator and Split can learn more about the Serpent River, which is significant in this alien culture. By understanding the inhabitants' attitudes, legends, and other information about the Serpent River, the protagonists aim to gather knowledge that will be useful for future peaceful trade relationships with Earth expeditions. Tomboldo is depicted as curious and interested in learning about the narrator and Split's spacecraft, further emphasizing his leadership role and desire for cultural exchange." />

And then, as the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each breathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of them. One was Gravgak.&#10; &#10; Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did not know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.&#10; &#10; Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were painted with green and black diamond designs.&#10; &#10; By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were invited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we would be safe. I nodded to Campbell. &quot;It's our chance to be guests of Tomboldo.&quot; Nothing could have pleased us more.

To analyze the river's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and to map its course—these facts were only a part of the information we sought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this planet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends they may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when future expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE) for an extension of peaceful trade relationships.&#10; &#10; Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was safe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees that had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we knew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent. Our ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests of Tomboldo.&#10; &#10; Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to hear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone" />
    <node id="The narrator's determination to consider the approaching alien (Tomboldo) as a friend and prepare to meet both aliens (the crowd of people) is likely due to their excitement and sense of kinship upon seeing man-like creatures on this unknown planet. This is the sixth time in the narrator's life of exploration that they have encountered such similarities, and it evokes strong emotional feelings of connection and excitement.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Campbell seems hesitant and concerned about their safety because he is more focused on their mission and following protocols for interacting with extraterrestrial beings. He is not as swayed by emotions as the narrator, and his primary concern is ensuring the crew's safety and fulfilling their objectives. This difference in perspective between the two characters highlights the importance of balancing emotional responses with rational thinking when encountering new situations and cultures." />

    <node id="when the siren from the silvery spaceship sounds, the tall man and some members of his party come out of their hiding places and stand as a defiant wall around their leader. They appear unafraid of the ship and its siren, in contrast to the naked warriors who were affected by the sound and ran for cover. The tall man and his group may be curious about the spaceship and its occupants, or they may be bold and fearless by nature. Alternatively, they may be important officials or leaders who are accustomed to being in charge and are not easily intimidated. Whatever their reasons, they do not seem threatened by the spaceship and its siren, and they stand their ground as the main character and Campbell descend from the ship with some equipment." />
    <node id="Vauna is the beautiful daughter of Tomboldo, one of the natives of the planet Benzendella where the protagonist's spaceship has landed. The protagonist, who remains unnamed throughout the story, first meets Vauna during his feverish delirium while he is unconscious for several weeks after their landing.

Later on, he regains consciousness and meets Vauna in person. They form a bond during his recovery, but their relationship is threatened by Gravgak, another native who also has feelings for Vauna.

A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her father, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak.&#10; &#10; From the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic moment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master—or her lover. He had called for her. She had followed.&#10; &#10; But her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door.&#10;&quot;Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.&quot;&#10; &#10; (I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called them! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified?

    <node id="The unexpected outcome of Gravgak's sudden recovery was that, as he moved to sit up, his fingers accidentally hit the handle of his club, causing it to whip upward and the stone at the end to crash into the narrator's head.

Their bond forms as she helps him regain his health and learn the Benzendellas' language." />
    <node id="1. Gravgak calling Vauna to speak with him alone was significant because it suggested that he wanted to have a private conversation with her, which could indicate that he had important things to discuss or that he wanted to assert his authority or affections towards her. This occurred in front of the protagonist and other people, making it a public display of Vauna's importance to Gravgak.&#10;2. Vauna's father, Tomboldo, reacted to the situation by calling them both back, which could indicate his desire to maintain control over the situation and protect his daughter. His reaction might also reflect the cultural norms of the Benzendella people, where elders or leaders may have authority over personal matters.&#10;3. The protagonist's interpretation of the situation as a dramatic moment suggests that he saw it as a significant event, possibly because he was worried about Vauna's safety or loyalty. The fact that Tomboldo called them back might have reassured him, but he also mentions that he wonders what would have happened if Tomboldo hadn't intervened, leaving open the possibility of different outcomes.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gravgak calling Vauna to speak with him alone was a significant action that could have had various implications for their relationship and the dynamics between the Benzendella people. Tomboldo's reaction further impacted the situation by highlighting his role as a protective father and potential leader. The protagonist's interpretation of the event suggests that he saw it as a critical moment in Vauna's life, with possible consequences for their own relationship." />

Split Campbell attempts to warn them by trying to alert the delirious Captain Linden, who is concerned about forgetting Clause D of the EGGWE Code, which forbids agents from entering into a marriage contract with native inhabitants. Campbell then tries to warn the natives directly by shouting &quot;Look out!&quot; but realizes that they are too engrossed in their ritual to notice the danger.

When Campbell heard the siren from the spaceship, he activated signal number sixteen, which caused the ship's siren to wail continuously for ten minutes. After setting the siren, he descended from the ship with Jim, taking equipment and breathing in the tangy air fiercely.

Grgravak's interaction with the protagonist was initially hostile, as he accidentally hit the narrator on the head with his club while recovering from the medical operation, causing the protagonist to lose consciousness. This interaction might have been unintentional, but it still had negative consequences for their relationship and the protagonist's health.&#10;2. Grgravak's interaction with Vauna was more complex, as he called her to speak with him alone, suggesting that he wanted to have a private conversation with her. His words and actions might have indicated his desire to assert his authority or affections towards her, possibly by challenging the protagonist's relationship with Vauna or expressing his own feelings for her.&#10;3. Grgravak's intentions are not entirely clear from the given text, but his behavior towards the protagonist and Vauna could be interpreted in various ways. He might have been trying to protect or assert himself, express his feelings, or cause harm to the protagonist. Regardless of his motivations, his actions had significant consequences for the story and the relationships between the characters.&#10;4. The text leaves open the possibility that Grgravak's hostility towards the protagonist was unintentional or related to his injury, but it also raises questions about his true intentions towards Vauna and the protagonist.

He describes the mysterious little songs murmured through their sleep as creating strange harmonies that whisper through the caves. If he stirs restlessly, Vauna comes to him in her sleeping garments, faintly visible in the pink light, and whispers melodious Benzendella words, telling him to go back to sleep.&#10;&#10;When the narrator cannot go back to sleep, Vauna responds with concern and care for his health. She reminds him that he is still weak and needs more rest. The narrator describes this as a weird sensation, trying to adjust himself to his surroundings.&#10;&#10;The revelation that Tomboldo, the elder Benzendella, has learned to talk is a significant moment in their relationship with the narrator. When the narrator awakens one night to see both Vauna and her father standing before him, Tomboldo raps his hand against the narrator's ribs, shakes the fiber bed lightly, and smiles. From a pocket concealed in his flowing cape, he draws forth the musical watch, touches the button, and plays, &quot;Trail of Stars.&quot; This is a sign that Tomboldo has learned to use the technology brought by the narrator's spaceship, indicating a growing bond between the two groups." />
    <node id="The revelation is that the &quot;sponge-trees&quot; are not just moving trees, but are actually serving as camouflage for a group of warriors. They are in the midst of an advancing army, which is about to launch a sneak attack on the natives who are gathered in their sunset ritual and oblivious to the danger. This realization prompts Split Campbell to take action to warn the natives and scare off the attacking warriors using the ship's siren." />
    <node id="Yes, the observer (Captain Linden) noticed mobile trees on the planet. These trees have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope.

    <node id="1. Campbell and the speaker (the narrator) have come to this extraterrestrial planet to learn about the Serpent River, which they refer to in their own language as such. Their main purpose is to understand the river's meanings in the culture of this planet for future peaceful trade relationships with Earth expeditions.&#10;2. They tried to communicate this to Tomboldo by making an eel-like motion with their arm and saying the words &quot;serpent river&quot; in their own language. However, Tomboldo and his companions do not understand, as they speak a different language (Benzendella)." />
    <node id="1. The two people discovered through the telescope are a man and a woman, who appear to be coming out of the ground from an underground city, although this is only a hypothesis. They are located a mile away, in a barren rock hillside, observing the sunset.&#10;2. Based on the evening sunshine observation, we can hypothesis that both individuals are humanoid in appearance, with the man being statuesque and muscular, and the woman standing nearby watching him. The man is dressed in a cream-colored robe and red sash and headdress, while the woman is more scantily clothed. They show no fear when the ship's siren goes off, suggesting a level of bravery or obliviousness to potential danger.&#10;3. The people in the scene are also accompanied by what the observer calls &quot;mobile trees,&quot; which have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope. This suggests that the planet has unique flora that is not found on Earth.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the observation made through the telescope, we can hypothesis that these two individuals are humanoid in appearance and originate from an underground city on this planet. They have some similarities to humans, such as bipedal locomotion, but also differences, such as their tolerance to the ship's siren and the presence of mobile trees in their environment. Further observation and analysis would be required to make more definitive conclusions about their origins and characteristics." />

However, his gesture of swinging the club could have been intended as a warning to the attackers.

Gravgak calling Vauna to speak with him alone was significant because it suggested that he wanted to have a private conversation with her, which could indicate that he had important things to discuss or that he wanted to assert his authority or affections towards her. This occurred in front of the protagonist and other people, making it a public display of Vauna's importance to Gravgak.&#10;2. Vauna's father, Tomboldo, reacted to the situation by calling them both back, which could indicate his desire to maintain control over the situation and protect his daughter. His reaction might also reflect the cultural norms of the Benzendella people, where elders or leaders may have authority over personal matters.&#10;3. The protagonist's interpretation of the situation as a dramatic moment suggests that he saw it as a significant event, possibly because he was worried about Vauna's safety or loyalty. The fact that Tomboldo called them back might have reassured him, but he also mentions that he wonders what would have happened if Tomboldo hadn't intervened, leaving open the possibility of different outcomes.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gravgak calling Vauna to speak with him alone was a significant action that could have had various implications for their relationship and the dynamics between the Benzendella people. Tomboldo's reaction further impacted the situation by highlighting his role as a protective father and potential leader. The protagonist's interpretation of the event suggests that he saw it as a critical moment in Vauna's life, with possible consequences for their own relationship.">

Grgravak's interaction with Vauna was more complex, as he called her to speak with him alone, suggesting that he wanted to have a private conversation with her.

Regardless of his motivations, his actions had significant consequences for the story and the relationships between the characters.&#10;4.

Gravgak calling Vauna to speak with him alone was significant because it suggested that he wanted to have a private conversation with her, which could indicate that he had important things to discuss or that he wanted to assert his authority or affections towards her. This occurred in front of the protagonist and other people, making it a public display of Vauna's importance to Gravgak.&#10;2. Vauna's father, Tomboldo, reacted to the situation by calling them both back, which could indicate his desire to maintain control over the situation and protect his daughter. His reaction might also reflect the cultural norms of the Benzendella people, where elders or leaders may have authority over personal matters.&#10;3. The protagonist's interpretation of the situation as a dramatic moment suggests that he saw it as a significant event, possibly because he was worried about Vauna's safety or loyalty. The fact that Tomboldo called them back might have reassured him, but he also mentions that he wonders what would have happened if Tomboldo hadn't intervened, leaving open the possibility of different outcomes.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gravgak calling Vauna to speak with him alone was a significant action that could have had various implications for their relationship and the dynamics between the Benzendella people. Tomboldo's reaction further impacted the situation by highlighting his role as a protective father and potential leader. The protagonist's interpretation of the event suggests that he saw it as a critical moment in Vauna's life, with possible consequences for their own relationship.">

The two people discovered through the telescope are a man and a woman, who appear to be coming out of the ground from an underground city, although this is only a hypothesis. They are located a mile away, in a barren rock hillside, observing the sunset.&#10;2. Based on the evening sunshine observation, we can hypothesis that both individuals are humanoid in appearance, with the man being statuesque and muscular, and the woman standing nearby watching him. The man is dressed in a cream-colored robe and red sash and headdress, while the woman is more scantily clothed. They show no fear when the ship's siren goes off, suggesting a level of bravery or obliviousness to potential danger.&#10;3. The people in the scene are also accompanied by what the observer calls &quot;mobile trees,&quot; which have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope. This suggests that the planet has unique flora that is not found on Earth.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the observation made through the telescope, we can hypothesis that these two individuals are humanoid in appearance and originate from an underground city on this planet. They have some similarities to humans, such as bipedal locomotion, but also differences, such as their tolerance to the ship's siren and the presence of mobile trees in their environment. Further observation and analysis would be required to make more definitive conclusions about their origins and characteristics.">

The man is dressed in a cream-colored robe and red sash and headdress, while the woman is more scantily clothed.

They have some similarities to humans, such as bipedal locomotion, but also differences, such as their tolerance to the ship's siren and the presence of mobile trees in their environment. Further observation and analysis would be required to make more definitive conclusions about their origins and characteristics.">

The attackers, who were naked warriors, heard the siren from the silvery spaceship and mistook it for an animal cry from an unknown world.

When Campbell heard the siren from the spaceship, he activated signal number sixteen, which caused the ship's siren to wail continuously for ten minutes. After setting the siren, he descended from the ship with Jim, taking equipment and breathing in the tangy air fiercely. When they saw the tall man of the party and some members of his group marching over the hilltop toward them, seemingly unafraid of the spaceship and its siren, Campbell remarked that their leader needed a stronger guard.">

Based on the evening sunshine observation, we can hypothesis that both individuals are humanoid in appearance, with the man being statuesque and muscular, and the woman standing nearby watching him. The man is dressed in a cream-colored robe and red sash and headdress, while the woman is more scantily clothed. They show no fear when the ship's siren goes off, suggesting a level of bravery or obliviousness to potential danger.&#10;3. The people in the scene are also accompanied by what the observer calls &quot;mobile trees,&quot; which have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope. This suggests that the planet has unique flora that is not found on Earth.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the observation made through the telescope, we can hypothesis that these two individuals are humanoid in appearance and originate from an underground city on this planet. They have some similarities to humans, such as bipedal locomotion, but also differences, such as their tolerance to the ship's siren and the presence of mobile trees in their environment. Further observation and analysis would be required to make more definitive conclusions about their origins and characteristics.">

This is the sixth time in the narrator's life of exploration that they have encountered such similarities, and it evokes strong emotional feelings of connection and excitement.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Campbell seems hesitant and concerned about their safety because he is more focused on their mission and following protocols for interacting with extraterrestrial beings. He is not as swayed by emotions as the narrator, and his primary concern is ensuring the crew's safety and fulfilling their objectives.

It follows a deep-worn path between hills and high jagged mountains on the horizon, and has likely been moving for centuries.

The two people discovered through the telescope are a man and a woman, who appear to be coming out of the ground from an underground city, although this is only a hypothesis. They are located a mile away, in a barren rock hillside, observing the sunset.&#10;2. Based on the evening sunshine observation, we can hypothesis that both individuals are humanoid in appearance, with the man being statuesque and muscular, and the woman standing nearby watching him. The man is dressed in a cream-colored robe and red sash and headdress, while the woman is more scantily clothed. They show no fear when the ship's siren goes off, suggesting a level of bravery or obliviousness to potential danger.&#10;3. The people in the scene are also accompanied by what the observer calls &quot;mobile trees,&quot; which have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope. This suggests that the planet has unique flora that is not found on Earth.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the observation made through the telescope, we can hypothesis that these two individuals are humanoid in appearance and originate from an underground city on this planet. They have some similarities to humans, such as bipedal locomotion, but also differences, such as their tolerance to the ship's siren and the presence of mobile trees in their environment. Further observation and analysis would be required to make more definitive conclusions about their origins and characteristics.">

    <edge source="Yes, the observer (Captain Linden) noticed mobile trees on the planet. These trees have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope. The people in the clearing beyond paid no attention to them. This observation was made when the Captain looked through the telescope, but Split, who was also observing the scene, did not mention or notice the moving trees as he was preoccupied with the females' white fur ornaments and their purpose." target="1. The two people discovered through the telescope are a man and a woman, who appear to be coming out of the ground from an underground city, although this is only a hypothesis. They are located a mile away, in a barren rock hillside, observing the sunset.&#10;2. Based on the evening sunshine observation, we can hypothesis that both individuals are humanoid in appearance, with the man being statuesque and muscular, and the woman standing nearby watching him. The man is dressed in a cream-colored robe and red sash and headdress, while the woman is more scantily clothed. They show no fear when the ship's siren goes off, suggesting a level of bravery or obliviousness to potential danger.&#10;3. The people in the scene are also accompanied by what the observer calls &quot;mobile trees,&quot; which have a muscular quality and were feeding along the surface of a slope. This suggests that the planet has unique flora that is not found on Earth.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the observation made through the telescope, we can hypothesis that these two individuals are humanoid in appearance and originate from an underground city on this planet. They have some similarities to humans, such as bipedal locomotion, but also differences, such as their tolerance to the ship's siren and the presence of mobile trees in their environment. Further observation and analysis would be required to make more definitive conclusions about their origins and characteristics.">

His skin was almost the color of the cream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in the breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this was matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as a circular mantle.&#10; &#10; The girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was some sort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with the setting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a break in the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions, his moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening.&#10; &#10; The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back of her.... Three.... Four.... Five....&#10; &#10; &quot;Where do they come from?&quot; Split had paused in the act of checking equipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, I might not have made a discovery. The landscape was&#10; &#10;  moving&#10; &#10; .&#10; &#10; The long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a prominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I looked out across the scene with">

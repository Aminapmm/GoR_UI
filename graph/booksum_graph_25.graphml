    <node id=" St. John Rivers objects to continuing their relationship as siblings instead of as man and wife because it would not be practical or socially acceptable. He argues that they cannot present Jane as his sister without arousing suspicions about their relationship, and that a woman traveling alone with a man in India would also raise eyebrows. Additionally, he believes that marriage is the only type of union that provides a permanent and conforming destiny for human beings, and that it would give an impetus to their efforts in advancing their Master's spiritual kingdom on earth by combining their physical and mental energies. He sees Jane as a helpmeet fitted to his purpose and vocation, rather than just a sister who might be taken away from him." />

Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong&#10;sense will guide you.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to&#10;the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and&#10;therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  &quot;St. John,&quot; I&#10;returned, &quot;I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us&#10;continue.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We cannot--we cannot,&quot; he answered, with short, sharp determination: &quot;it&#10;would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you&#10;have said that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Conditionally.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the&#10;co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.

    <node id="&quot;Well?&quot; he answered icily.&#10;&#10;&quot;I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but&#10;not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A part of me you must become,&quot; he answered steadily; &quot;otherwise the&#10;whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me&#10;to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be&#10;for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage&#10;tribes--and unwed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well,&quot; I said shortly; &quot;under the circumstances, quite as well as&#10;if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like&#10;yourself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:&#10;to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And&#10;for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's&#10;heart and--it would not do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would do,&quot; I affirmed with some disdain, &quot;perfectly well.

No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will&#10;never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:&#10;I will tell him so.&quot;&#10;&#10;I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;&#10;his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to&#10;his feet and approached me.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Your answer requires a commentary,&quot; he said; &quot;it is not clear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let&#10;us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.&quot;&#10;&#10;He shook his head.  &quot;Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you&#10;were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no&#10;wife.

    <node id=" me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have&#10;already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to&#10;withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have&#10;undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,&#10;feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one&#10;purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your&#10;great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that&#10;is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister&#10;might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can&#10;influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.&quot;&#10;&#10;I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on&#10;my limbs.&#10;&#10;&quot;Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.

Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on&#10;your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth&#10;will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once&#10;whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to&#10;your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the&#10;only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the&#10;destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor&#10;caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple&#10;about the degree, kind," />

    <node id=" Jane Eyre made several changes to Moor House in order to create a mix of familiarity and novelty for Diana and Mary's return. She left the ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms much as they were, knowing that her cousins would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, chairs, and beds. However, she introduced some novelties to give their return the piquancy she wished it to have. She put down dark handsome new carpets and curtains, arranged some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, provided new coverings, mirrors, and dressing-cases for the toilet tables, making them look fresh without being glaring.&#10;  A spare parlour and bedroom she refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery. She laid canvas on the passage and carpets on the stairs.

My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so&#10;eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's&#10;taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow&#10;of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the&#10;day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the&#10;accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of&#10;reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the&#10;very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap&#10;was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that &quot;a poor&#10;lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his&#10;mother, who was drawing away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where does she live, Hannah?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all&#10;the way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him" />

Do you&#10;hear, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause&#10;to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!&quot;&#10;&#10;Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was&#10;charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned&#10;topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And&#10;really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was&#10;delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.&#10;I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:&#10;my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I&#10;pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.

    <node id=", I got him to make the tour of the&#10;house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered&#10;upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of&#10;fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so&#10;short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the&#10;improved aspect of his abode.&#10;&#10;This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed&#10;some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:&#10;no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously&#10;respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more&#10;thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,&#10;had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,&#10;could I tell him where such a book was?&quot;&#10;&#10;I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader" />

While the driver and Hannah brought&#10;in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from&#10;the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave&#10;each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a&#10;while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would&#10;soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.&#10;&#10;I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give&#10;hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.&#10;They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;&#10;with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:&#10;they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of&#10;feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I&#10;had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.&#10;&#10;Sweet was that evening.

    <node id="I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;He took it.  &quot;You give it up very gleefully,&quot; said he; &quot;I don't quite&#10;understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment&#10;you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are&#10;relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you&#10;now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force&#10;of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;&#10;my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of&#10;cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,&#10;bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to&#10;ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and&#10;lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected&#10;will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of&#10;currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up&#10;of materials for mince-p" />
    <node id=" when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.&#10;&#10;In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the&#10;will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present&#10;residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was&#10;quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,&#10;entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty&#10;on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early&#10;answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when&#10;two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought&#10;nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.&#10;&#10;I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&#10;Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some&#10;weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached&#10;me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester wants Jane Eyre to give up learning German and start learning Hindostanee because he is himself studying Hindostanee and finds it difficult to remember the beginning of his lessons as he advances. He thinks that having a pupil like Jane, with whom he can repeatedly go over the elements, will help him fix them thoroughly in his mind. He has chosen Jane over his sisters for this task because he believes she is able to concentrate on a task longer than they can." />
    <node id=" dared complain, because I saw that to murmur&#10;would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse&#10;was a special annoyance.&#10;&#10;One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had&#10;a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading&#10;Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a&#10;translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found&#10;myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it&#10;had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot&#10;tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment&#10;superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, what are you doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Learning German.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not in earnest?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;" />
    <node id=" I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget&#10;the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with&#10;whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them&#10;thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between&#10;me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could&#10;sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I&#10;should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now&#10;barely three months to his departure.&#10;&#10;St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every&#10;impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and&#10;permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found&#10;her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both&#10;she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to&#10;such a step.

But I feel mine is&#10;not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?&#10;He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,&#10;in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very&#10;plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty&#10;land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that&#10;ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so&#10;absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some&#10;impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of&#10;course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to&#10;replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the&#10;most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not," />
    <node id=" elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to&#10;aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to&#10;mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give&#10;to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his&#10;own.&#10;&#10;Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late&#10;it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my&#10;heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.&#10;&#10;Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these&#10;changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with&#10;me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a&#10;sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a&#10;tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to&#10;know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom" />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Mr. Rochester states that &quot;the battle is fought and the victory won&quot; in reference to his personal circumstances, indicating that he has overcome a significant obstacle or challenge in his life. Jane's response demonstrates her understanding of his situation as she acknowledges that she can fulfill his request for her to learn Hindostanee, but also expresses her own concerns about their relationship and her future in India.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's reference to Mr. Rochester's past frigidity towards her suggests that the battle he refers to may be related to his personal feelings and emotions. It is possible that he has come to terms with his feelings for Jane and has accepted their relationship, thus feeling victorious in his internal struggle.&#10;&#10;Jane's response also shows her understanding of Mr. Rochester's priorities and perspective on life. She recognizes that he values their relationship above all else, even if it means sacrificing practicality or social conventions. However, Jane also acknowledges her own mortality and concerns about being in India, highlighting the differences in their perspectives and priorities.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester's statement suggests a significant turning point in his personal circumstances, which Jane understands to be related to their relationship. While she is willing to fulfill his request, she also expresses her own concerns and priorities, demonstrating a complex understanding of their situation." />

When I remembered how far I had once been&#10;admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present&#10;frigidity.&#10;&#10;Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his&#10;head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--&#10;&#10;&quot;You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.&quot;&#10;&#10;Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a&#10;moment's hesitation I answered--&#10;&#10;&quot;But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose&#10;triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be&#10;called upon to contend for such another.

    <node id=" When Diana pushed Jane towards St. John, causing him to kiss her, Jane felt uncomfortable and confused. She noticed that St. John's feelings were pent up and that he was disappointed because he had expected submission from her, not resistance. Despite this, he bore with her perversity as a sincere Christian and allowed time for reflection and repentance.&#10;&#10;Later that night, St. John intentionally omitted shaking hands with Jane, hurting her feelings. However, when she ran after him to make up, he was still cold and displeased, showing no interest in reconciliation. He eventually asked Jane to be his pupil in studying Hindostanee, arguing that it would assist him greatly and that she could sit at a task the longest of the three sisters. Jane, feeling obligated to not lightly refuse St. John, agreed to his request.&#10;&#10;The narrative then reveals that Rosamond Oliver is about to be married to Mr. Granby, information that St. John shares calmly and serenely, leaving Diana, Mary, and Jane looking at him in surprise." />

Diana, who chanced to be in a&#10;frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for&#10;hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat&#10;her as such: you should kiss her too.&quot;&#10;&#10;She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt&#10;uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.&#10;John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his&#10;eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.

As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in&#10;his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere&#10;and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected&#10;submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has&#10;detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to&#10;sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into&#10;obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with&#10;my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.&#10;&#10;That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget&#10;even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,&#10;though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked&#10;omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,&quot; said Diana, &quot;during&#10;your walk on the" />

But go after him; he is now lingering in the&#10;passage expecting you--he will make it up.&quot;&#10;&#10;I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be&#10;happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the&#10;stairs.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-night, St. John,&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-night, Jane,&quot; he replied calmly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then shake hands,&quot; I added.&#10;&#10;What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply&#10;displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor&#10;tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no&#10;cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and&#10;placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was&#10;not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had&#10;nothing to forgive, not having been offended.&#10;&#10;And with" />
    <node id=" The influence of St. John on the speaker, referred to as &quot;I&quot; in the narrative, led to a significant change in her behavior and feelings while they were working together. Specifically, she felt that her liberty of mind was taken away because she became overly conscious of his disapproval of anything but serious moods and occupations. This caused her to suppress her vivacity and feel as if she was under a &quot;freezing spell&quot; when around him. She also mentions feeling obligated to not lightly refuse his request for her to be his pupil in studying Hindostanee, despite not wanting to do so initially.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speaker did not enjoy having limited freedom and restrained vivacity around St. John, as evidenced by her statement that she &quot;did not love [her] servitude&quot; and wished many times that things were different. Her feelings of discomfort and unease are further illustrated when she describes running after him to make up and being met with coldness and a lack of interest in reconciliation.&#10;&#10;In summary, St. John's influence on the speaker led to a significant change in her behavior and feelings, causing her to feel restrained and uncomfortable around him. She did not enjoy having limited freedom or suppressing her vivacity, but felt obligated to comply with his requests due to his exacting nature." />

He answered quietly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I know it.&quot;&#10;&#10;I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:&#10;he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,&#10;he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he&#10;acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:&#10;his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I&#10;could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely&#10;importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was&#10;distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and&#10;occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain&#10;or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he&#10;said &quot;go,&quot; I went; &quot;come,&quot; I came; &quot;do this,&quot; I did it.  But I did not&#10;love my servitude: I wished, many a time" />

While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of&#10;encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I&#10;fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some&#10;Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his&#10;plans.&#10;&#10;Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed&#10;enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-&#10;looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his&#10;fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it&#10;would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly&#10;to our table.

He had held me in awe, because he had&#10;held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could&#10;not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:&#10;the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his&#10;fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there&#10;where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,&#10;I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness&#10;and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I&#10;felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with&#10;whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.&#10;&#10;He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently&#10;risked an upward glance at his countenance.&#10;&#10;His eye, bent on me, expressed at once" />

You have introduced a topic on&#10;which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the&#10;very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were&#10;required, what should we do?  How should we feel?

    <node id=" Based on the provided narrative, the speaker observes that Mr. Rochester encourages Jane to attend Morton school despite inclement weather, while also making light of any concerns raised by his sisters about her safety. This suggests that Mr. Rochester values Jane's determination and independence, as well as her commitment to her responsibilities at the school.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Jane makes changes to his home, Mr. Rochester initially appears unimpressed, leading the speaker to wonder if he has disturbed some of Mr. Rochester's valued associations. However, Mr. Rochester later clarifies that he appreciates how carefully Jane has respected these associations, suggesting that he values her thoughtfulness and consideration.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speaker's observations suggest that Mr. Rochester sees Jane as a strong and capable individual who is capable of making her own decisions and taking care of herself. He appears to respect her autonomy and values her contributions, whether it be in her work at Morton school or in her efforts to improve his home." />
    <node id=" yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly&#10;to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual&#10;satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me&#10;of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more&#10;was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or&#10;rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would&#10;invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish&#10;the task without regard to the elements.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,&quot; he would say: &quot;she&#10;can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well&#10;as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better&#10;calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.&quot;&#10;&#10;And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little&#10;weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur&#10;would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse&#10;was a special annoyance" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, St. John's reaction to the news of Rosamond Oliver's engagement is one of calm serenity. He is not visibly disturbed or upset by the news and instead states the facts in a matter-of-fact manner. When his sisters express surprise at the haste of the union, he simply explains that there were no obstacles to the match, indicating that he may have already known about and accepted the likelihood of this outcome. Overall, St. John's reaction is one of detachment and lack of strong emotion, consistent with his reserved and unsocial character." />
    <node id=" The conflict between the narrator (Jane) and St. John arises from their differing views on devotion and commitment to furthering the missionary cause. St. John believes that Jane's mental and personal endowments make her fit for a missionary's wife, and that they should marry and serve together in India. He sees their union as a complete and single-minded dedication to their religious vocation, expecting Jane to give her &quot;entire&quot; self, including her heart, to the cause.&#10;&#10;Jane, on the other hand, feels that St. John is asking too much of her. While she agrees to offer her energies and abilities for the missionary work, she wants to withhold her deepest emotional connections and personal identity, fearing that submission to his proposal would lead to &quot;premature death&quot; and the loss of half herself. Jane perceives St. John's demand as excessive and unreasonable, wanting to retain her individuality and sense of self while contributing to the religious cause.&#10;&#10;In addition, their conflict is heightened by St. John's lack of empathy for Jane's feelings and reluctance to respect her boundaries. He dismisses Jane's concerns and insists on her complete devotion, showing no interest in reconciliation when he feels offended. This inflexibility and disregard for Jane's emotional needs create tension and frustration between the two characters, deepening their conflict." />

Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go&#10;to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between&#10;leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I&#10;know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.

It was as if I had heard&#10;a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of&#10;Macedonia, had enounced, &quot;Come over and help us!&quot;  But I was no&#10;apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, St. John!&quot; I cried, &quot;have some mercy!&quot;&#10;&#10;I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,&#10;knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--&#10;&#10;&quot;God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not&#10;personal, but mental endowments they have given you" />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, St. John Rivers informs his sisters and Jane Eyre that Rosamond Oliver is about to be married to Mr. Granby. According to St. John, he received this information from Rosamond's father the previous day. St. John mentions that Rosamond and Mr. Granby met in October at the county ball in S-, and have known each other for only two months. The narrative suggests that St. John is not surprised or upset by this news, and he relays the information in a calm and serene manner. There is no indication of any strong emotions on his part regarding this announcement." />
    <node id=": he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began&#10;to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.&#10;The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its&#10;peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after&#10;what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor&#10;approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,&#10;still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I&#10;comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that&#10;it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by&#10;inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him&#10;that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should&#10;despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he&#10;should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever&#10;conducting" />

Would not a life devoted to the&#10;task of regenerating your race be well spent?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said; &quot;but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own&#10;faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.

    <node id=" Based on the speaker's observations in the narrative, Jane Eyre is depicted as a strong, capable, and independent individual who values her own autonomy and decision-making. She is committed to her responsibilities, as evidenced by her dedication to Morton school, and is respected by Mr. Rochester for her thoughtfulness and consideration.&#10;&#10;Jane also demonstrates a complex understanding of the situations and people around her, such as when she acknowledges Mr. Rochester's priorities and perspective on life while also expressing her own concerns about their relationship and future in India. She is willing to fulfill his request to learn Hindostanee, but does not shy away from sharing her own thoughts and feelings.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane values her personal identity and emotional connections, as demonstrated by her conflict with St. John Rivers. While she agrees to offer her energies and abilities for the missionary work, she wants to retain her individuality and sense of self. She perceives St. John's demand for complete devotion as excessive and unreasonable, highlighting her desire to maintain a balance between fulfilling her responsibilities and preserving her own values and priorities.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane is portrayed as a strong-willed, intelligent, and empathetic character who values her independence and personal identity while also being committed to her responsibilities and relationships." />
    <node id=" Based on your observations of Jane's abilities and character over the past ten months, you believe she is capable of accomplishing the undertaking you are discussing because she has demonstrated a consistent pattern of being diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous. You have seen her perform well in her role as a teacher at Morton school, handle sudden wealth with clarity and detachment, and show a willingness to set aside her own interests for the sake of justice. Additionally, you have observed her capacity for self-discipline and perseverance, even in the face of difficulties or challenges. While Jane may currently feel unprepared and unmotivated, your belief in her abilities stems from the confidence that she will be able to draw on these strengths and qualities as she becomes more familiar with the demands of the undertaking." />

In&#10;the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,&#10;keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the&#10;claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame&#10;and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,&#10;you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another&#10;because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have&#10;since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with&#10;which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the&#10;qualities I seek.

The speaker values her own abilities and desires to enjoy her faculties in addition to helping others develop theirs.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative, there is no mention of St. John Rivers reacting to or even being informed about the engagement between Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre. The passage provided focuses on Jane's conflict with St. John regarding her own goals and desires, as well as her observations about his personality and suitability for marriage. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.&#10;&#10;However, the passage does provide insight into how Jane's relationship with St. John changes after she declines his proposal of marriage and assertes her independence. Jane recognizes that St. John may be too focused on his own ambitions and may not be capable of forming a fulfilling emotional connection with his partner. This realization highlights the differences in their perspectives and values, which may create tension and distance in their relationship. Nonetheless, the narrative does not provide specific information about how St. John reacts to the news of Jane's engagement to Mr. Rochester." />

Presently he rose up, saying--&#10;&#10;&quot;Excuse me; I have an appointment of business in the village this morning.&#10;I shall not return till after dark: perhaps it will be as well that we&#10;dine early.&quot;&#10;&#10;He quitted the room.  The three sisters looked at each other when he was&#10;gone--looked with a gravitation and surprise which words could not&#10;express.  That evening, St. John was at home at the usual hour; he seemed&#10;the same as ever: there was nothing in his manner to show that he had&#10;experienced any agitation during the day.  He sat down to dinner with us;&#10;he even tried to join in our conversation: but it was a failure--he could&#10;not manage it: whether from inability or disinclination, I cannot say.&#10;He left the table and went into the drawing-room before we had finished&#10;our dessert.  When the ladies rose up to retire, he withdrew with them; but&#10;I heard him ask Mary to stay a little in the room and speak to him: she&#10;consented, as it was very unusual.  I knew not what passed between them;&#10;but I perceived that when they rejoined me, his arm was round her waist,&#10;and that he seemed to repose more confidence on her than before.  What&#10;had taken place, I found out afterwards.  He had simply asked her if she&#10;could accompany him to India--if she would consent to become his wife, and&#10;go with him as a missionary's helpmate to preach the gospel to the heathen." />

The air of the moors, the freedom of&#10;home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some&#10;life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon&#10;till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,&#10;original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and&#10;sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our&#10;vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish&#10;was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in&#10;visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.&#10;&#10;One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some&#10;minutes, asked him, &quot;If his plans were yet unchanged.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Unchanged and unchangeable,&quot; was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform&#10;us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the&#10;ensuing year.&#10;&#10;&quot;And Rosam" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, the most glorious occupation that Jane Eyre could adopt, as suggested by St. John Rivers, would be to become a missionary and go to India with him. This occupation is portrayed as &quot;the most glorious man can adopt or God assign&quot; because of its noble causes and sublime results, which are described as being capable of filling the void left by lost affections and shattered hopes.&#10;&#10;Jane recognizes that this occupation would be a worthy replacement for her previous goals and aspirations, but she also expresses reservations about it. Specifically, she notes that if she were to go with St. John as his wife, she would feel as though she was abandoning half of herself and sacrificing her own desires in order to fulfill his expectations. Nonetheless, the narrative suggests that this occupation would be a significant and meaningful way for Jane to spend her time and contribute to society.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting, however, that the narrative does not provide a clear answer to this question, as it focuses more on Jane's internal conflict and her relationship with St. John than on the specific details of the missionary work. Therefore, while becoming a missionary in India is portrayed as a potentially glorious occupation for Jane, the narrative does not offer a definitive or exhaustive explanation of its merits or drawbacks." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, the protagonist of Jane Eyre, Jane, does not fully commit herself to God's cause as advocated by St. John Rivers. While she agrees to offer her energies and abilities for the missionary work in India, she wants to retain her individuality and sense of self, and perceives St. John's demand for complete devotion as excessive and unreasonable.&#10;&#10;Jane expresses this stance through her words and feelings by acknowledging Mr. Rochester's priorities and perspective on life, but also expressing her own concerns about their relationship and future in India. She is willing to fulfill his request to learn Hindostanee, but does not shy away from sharing her own thoughts and feelings with him.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane values her personal identity and emotional connections, as demonstrated by her conflict with St. John Rivers. She wants to maintain a balance between fulfilling her responsibilities and preserving her own values and priorities, and perceives St. John's demand for complete devotion as excessive and unreasonable.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane is portrayed as a strong-willed, intelligent, and empathetic character who values her independence and personal identity while also being committed to her responsibilities and relationships." />
    <node id=" Based on the passage provided, the single most important reason Jane Eyre decides against marrying St. John Rivers is that she does not love him as a wife should love a husband. While St. John presents several arguments in favor of their marriage, including the practical benefits and their shared missionary goals, Jane's emotional response makes it clear that she does not feel the same level of affection for him. She tells him that she only has &quot;a comrade's constancy&quot; and &quot;a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant,&quot; but not the love that should exist between a married couple. Furthermore, when St. John suggests that enough love would follow upon marriage, Jane scorns the idea and stands firm in her decision not to marry him. Therefore, the lack of romantic love is the primary reason Jane decides against marrying St. John Rivers." />

And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,&#10;you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be&#10;married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of&#10;love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your&#10;eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I scorn your idea of love,&quot; I could not help saying, as I rose up and&#10;stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  &quot;I scorn the&#10;counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you&#10;offer it.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Mr. Rochester believes that it is God's intention for Jane Eyre to be his Hindostanee language tutor and help him fix the beginning of his lessons in his mind as he advances in his studies. He has chosen Jane over his sisters for this task because he believes she is able to concentrate on a task longer than they can.&#10;&#10;When Jane expresses concerns about their relationship and future in India, Mr. Rochester responds by acknowledging her objections but also asserting his own priorities and perspective on life. He argues that their relationship and future are not as important as the work they will be doing in India, and that Jane's role as his tutor is crucial to his success in this endeavor.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester does not necessarily view this task as a religious or divine calling, but rather as a practical and necessary step towards achieving his goals. However, he may see it as part of God's plan for him to have Jane by his side as he pursues his studies and missionary work in India.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that the narrative does not provide explicit information about Mr. Rochester's beliefs about God's intentions for Jane beyond this specific task. Therefore, any answer to this question must be based on the information provided in the passage and cannot be a comprehensive or definitive account of his views." />
    <node id=" The speaker, Jane Eyre, is preparing for the arrival of her cousins Diana and Mary by ensuring that all household tasks and chores are completed perfectly. She wants to give them a &quot;beau-ideal of a welcome&quot; with the help of &quot;domestic endearments and household joys.&quot; However, St. John Rivers does not share Jane's enthusiasm for domesticity. He suggests that Jane should look beyond these material comforts and focus on higher goals, emphasizing that this world is not a place for fruition or rest. He urges her not to seek &quot;slothful&quot; contentment in household tasks and encourages her to be busy with more important matters. St. John's response indicates his belief in the subordination of domestic concerns to religious and professional pursuits, which aligns with his reserved and unsocial character." />

    <node id="The passage does not explicitly state St. John Rivers' hope for Jane regarding her new position and relationships. However, based on his character and beliefs, it can be inferred that he hopes Jane will use her talents and energies to advance their shared missionary goals in India. He sees Jane as a helpmeet fitted to his purpose and vocation, rather than just a sister who might be taken away from him.&#10;&#10;To ensure that Jane uses her talents wisely, St. John insists that she accompany him to India as a missionary and learn Hindostanee. By doing so, he believes that they can combine their physical and mental energies to advance their Master's spiritual kingdom on earth. He sees this as a permanent and conforming destiny for human beings, which would provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment for both of them.&#10;&#10;Therefore, St. John hopes that Jane will use her talents in service of their religious mission, and he plans to ensure this by bringing her along to India and encouraging her to learn the necessary language and skills." />
    <node id=" The scene takes place in a winding glen that St. John Rivers and Jane Eyre are traversing, as per St. John's instructions. The landscape is described as having a soft turf covered in moss, fine white flowers, and star-like yellow blossoms, with hills surrounding them and a stream running alongside.&#10;&#10;St. John himself appears calm and serene, not showing any strong emotions or reacting visibly to the news of Rosamond Oliver's engagement that he has just shared. He seems focused and in tune with his surroundings as they walk, taking in the scents and sights around him. When they reach a certain point, he suggests that they rest there, looking up at the pass and down the hollow with a thoughtful expression.&#10;&#10;Overall, St. John's reaction is one of detachment and tranquility, consistent with his reserved and unsocial character. He shows no signs of distress or concern, even as he gazes out into the distance and speaks about seeing this place again in dreams." />
    <node id="  I have always faithfully observed the&#10;one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic&#10;vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances&#10;warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful&#10;obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the&#10;wild track of the glen, side by side with him.&#10;&#10;The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents&#10;of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending&#10;the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and&#10;clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the&#10;firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy&#10;fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and&#10;spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us&#10;quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us rest here,&quot; said St. John, as we reached the first strag" />

He looked up the pass and down&#10;the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to&#10;traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let&#10;the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with&#10;the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.&#10;&#10;&quot;And I shall see it again,&quot; he said aloud, &quot;in dreams when I sleep by the&#10;Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber over" />
    <node id=" The primary reason for Jane Eyre's scorn towards St. John Rivers' offer of sentiment is that she does not love him as a wife should love a husband, while he seems to view marriage in a more practical and mission-oriented way. When St. John suggests that enough love would follow upon marriage, Jane scorns the idea and stands firm in her decision not to marry him.&#10;&#10;As for Jane's advice for St. John to abandon his scheme of marriage, it is likely because she believes that he is too focused on his own ambitions and may not be capable of forming a fulfilling emotional connection with his partner. Jane recognizes the potential tension and distance in their relationship if they were to marry without love. Additionally, Jane values her personal identity and emotional connections, and perceives St. John's demand for complete devotion as excessive and unreasonable. Thus, she advises him to abandon his scheme of marriage to maintain his individuality and sense of self." />
    <node id="The protagonist, Jane Eyre, responds to St. John Rivers' proposal by declining it, as she does not love him in the way a wife should love a husband. She scorns his suggestion that enough love would follow upon marriage, emphasizing the importance of emotional connection and affection in a relationship. Jane values her personal identity and individuality, perceiving St. John's demand for complete devotion as excessive and unreasonable. Instead, she advises him to abandon his scheme of marriage to maintain his sense of self.&#10;&#10;Jane expresses her feelings towards St. John's idea of love by highlighting the lack of romantic affection between them. She tells him that she only has &quot;a comrade's constancy&quot; and &quot;a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant,&quot; but not the kind of love that should exist between a married couple. Jane emphasizes the importance of emotional connection in a relationship, suggesting that St. John's more practical approach to marriage is insufficient for her. She ultimately prioritizes her own feelings and values over societal expectations or material comforts, choosing to remain true to herself and her desires." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, St. John's influence had a significant impact on the speaker's behavior and feelings while they were working together. The speaker felt that her liberty of mind was taken away because she became overly conscious of his disapproval of anything but serious moods and occupations. This caused her to suppress her vivacity and feel as if she was under a &quot;freezing spell&quot; when around him. She also mentions feeling obligated to not lightly refuse his request for her to be his pupil in studying Hindostanee, despite not wanting to do so initially.&#10;&#10;The speaker did not enjoy having limited freedom and restrained vivacity around St. John, as evidenced by her statement that she &quot;did not love [her] servitude&quot; and wished many times that things were different. Her feelings of discomfort and unease are further illustrated when she describes running after him to make up and being met with coldness and a lack of interest in reconciliation.&#10;&#10;In summary, St. John's influence on the speaker led to a significant change in her behavior and feelings, causing her to feel restrained and uncomfortable around him. She did not enjoy having limited freedom or suppressing her vivacity, but felt obligated to comply with his requests due to his exacting nature." />
    <node id=" The man referred to here is St. John Rivers, who has taken a berth in an East Indiaman to sail for India in six weeks. He sees his work as a missionary under God's guidance as his glory and joy. By serving an infallible Master, he means that he believes in the supreme authority of God and finds purpose and fulfillment in carrying out His will.&#10;&#10;St. John expresses surprise that others do not share the same desire to join this enterprise because he perceives it as a noble cause with sublime results. He sees the potential for filling the void left by lost affections and shattered hopes through such missionary work. St. John believes that those who are qualified for this task will recognize it themselves, and he feels duty-bound to encourage and stir up those who are worthy and capable of accomplishing it.&#10;&#10;In summary, when St. John Rivers speaks of his glory and joy in serving an infallible Master, he expresses his deep commitment to fulfilling God's will as a missionary. His surprise at others not sharing the same desire likely stems from his strong convictions about the importance and significance of this work." />

An austere patriot's passion for his&#10;fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to&#10;me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which&#10;sails on the 20th of June.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,&quot; I answered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an&#10;infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to&#10;the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,&#10;my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that&#10;all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the&#10;same enterprise.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, St. John Rivers appears to have a deep connection with the mountainous landscape they are traversing. He seems to be in tune with his surroundings, taking in the scents and sights around him. When they reach a certain point, he suggests that they rest there, looking up at the pass and down the hollow with a thoughtful expression.&#10;&#10;St. John appears to be communicating with the &quot;genius of the haunt&quot; as he stands near Jane and removes his hat, letting the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seems to be saying goodbye to something as his gaze wanders away with the stream and returns to traverse the unclouded heaven.&#10;&#10;It is not explicitly stated in the narrative what St. John is saying goodbye to, but it can be inferred that he may be acknowledging his departure from this place and the end of a chapter in his life. The fact that he mentions seeing the place again in dreams when he sleeps by the Ganges suggests that he has a deep emotional attachment to the landscape and may associate it with fond memories or significant experiences.&#10;&#10;Overall, St. John's relationship with the mountainous landscape appears to be one of reverence and appreciation for its beauty and tranquility. His communion with the &quot;genius of the haunt&quot; reflects his spiritual connection with nature and the world around him." />
    <node id=" In this relationship, St. John's kiss serves as a symbolic gesture that highlights the power dynamic between him and the narrator, Jane Eyre. The description of the kiss as &quot;an experiment kiss&quot; suggests that St. John is testing or evaluating Jane's feelings for him, while the comparison to &quot;marble kisses or ice kisses&quot; implies a lack of warmth or emotion in the gesture.&#10;&#10;For Jane, the kiss feels like a &quot;seal affixed to my fetters,&quot; further emphasizing the restrictive and oppressive nature of the relationship. She does not react with blushing or other signs of romantic attraction but instead feels a sense of obligation and constraint. This reaction underscores the lack of genuine affection in their relationship and highlights Jane's growing awareness that she must &quot;disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent&quot; in order to please St. John.&#10;&#10;The kiss also serves as a reminder of the impossibility of meeting St. John's exacting standards, as he wants to &quot;train [Jane] to an elevation I could never reach.&quot; The gravity and quiescence with which Jane submits to the daily ritual of the kiss suggest her growing resignation to this reality, even as she wishes more to please him.&#10;&#10;Overall, the significance of St. John's kiss in their relationship is that it highlights the power imbalance between them, underscores the lack of genuine affection, and represents a symbolic fetter or constraint on Jane's freedom and individuality. The kiss serves as a reminder of the impossible standards St. John sets for her, and the obligation and resignation she feels in response to his expectations." />

When given, he viewed&#10;me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;&#10;perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss&#10;were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony&#10;afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,&#10;seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.&#10;&#10;As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily&#10;more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my&#10;faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the&#10;adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to&#10;train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to&#10;aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to&#10;mould" />
    <node id=" The protagonist, Jane Eyre, is trying to convey to St. John Rivers that while she understands and respects his desire to become a missionary, she does not share the same level of devotion and commitment to their religious vocation. When Jane suggests that she will give her &quot;heart to God,&quot; but implies there is no need for it, there might be a hint of sarcasm in her response because she is highlighting the difference between St. John's expectations and her own feelings about marriage and devotion.&#10;&#10;Jane has already expressed her reservations about marrying St. John Rivers and submitting completely to his religious goals. By implying that she will offer her &quot;heart to God,&quot; she is acknowledging the importance of faith in their lives but also suggesting that such complete devotion may not be necessary or realistic. The possible sarcasm comes from Jane's subtle critique of St. John's inflexibility and disregard for her emotional needs, which creates tension and frustration between the two characters.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane is trying to convey to St. John that she does not share his extreme views on devotion and marriage, while also hinting at sarcasm as a way of expressing her own feelings about the situation." />

Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on&#10;your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth&#10;will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once&#10;whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to&#10;your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the&#10;only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the&#10;destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor&#10;caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple&#10;about the degree, kind," target=" Based on the passage provided, the single most important reason Jane Eyre decides against marrying St. John Rivers is that she does not love him as a wife should love a husband. While St. John presents several arguments in favor of their marriage, including the practical benefits and their shared missionary goals, Jane's emotional response makes it clear that she does not feel the same level of affection for him. She tells him that she only has &quot;a comrade's constancy&quot; and &quot;a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant,&quot; but not the love that should exist between a married couple. Furthermore, when St. John suggests that enough love would follow upon marriage, Jane scorns the idea and stands firm in her decision not to marry him. Therefore, the lack of romantic love is the primary reason Jane decides against marrying St. John Rivers.">

Despite this, he bore with her perversity as a sincere Christian and allowed time for reflection and repentance.&#10;&#10;Later that night, St. John intentionally omitted shaking hands with Jane, hurting her feelings. However, when she ran after him to make up, he was still cold and displeased, showing no interest in reconciliation. He eventually asked Jane to be his pupil in studying Hindostanee, arguing that it would assist him greatly and that she could sit at a task the longest of the three sisters. Jane, feeling obligated to not lightly refuse St. John, agreed to his request.&#10;&#10;The narrative then reveals that Rosamond Oliver is about to be married to Mr. Granby, information that St. John shares calmly and serenely, leaving Diana, Mary, and Jane looking at him in surprise.">

He has chosen Jane over his sisters for this task because he believes she is able to concentrate on a task longer than they can.&#10;&#10;When Jane expresses concerns about their relationship and future in India, Mr. Rochester responds by acknowledging her objections but also asserting his own priorities and perspective on life. He argues that their relationship and future are not as important as the work they will be doing in India, and that Jane's role as his tutor is crucial to his success in this endeavor.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester does not necessarily view this task as a religious or divine calling, but rather as a practical and necessary step towards achieving his goals. However, he may see it as part of God's plan for him to have Jane by his side as he pursues his studies and missionary work in India.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that the narrative does not provide explicit information about Mr. Rochester's beliefs about God's intentions for Jane beyond this specific task. Therefore, any answer to this question must be based on the information provided in the passage and cannot be a comprehensive or definitive account of his views.">

However, when she ran after him to make up, he was still cold and displeased, showing no interest in reconciliation. He eventually asked Jane to be his pupil in studying Hindostanee, arguing that it would assist him greatly and that she could sit at a task the longest of the three sisters.

He sees his work as a missionary under God's guidance as his glory and joy. By serving an infallible Master, he means that he believes in the supreme authority of God and finds purpose and fulfillment in carrying out His will.&#10;&#10;St. John expresses surprise that others do not share the same desire to join this enterprise because he perceives it as a noble cause with sublime results. He sees the potential for filling the void left by lost affections and shattered hopes through such missionary work. St. John believes that those who are qualified for this task will recognize it themselves, and he feels duty-bound to encourage and stir up those who are worthy and capable of accomplishing it.&#10;&#10;In summary, when St. John Rivers speaks of his glory and joy in serving an infallible Master, he expresses his deep commitment to fulfilling God's will as a missionary. His surprise at others not sharing the same desire likely stems from his strong convictions about the importance and significance of this work.">

St. John believes that Jane's mental and personal endowments make her fit for a missionary's wife, and that they should marry and serve together in India. He sees their union as a complete and single-minded dedication to their religious vocation, expecting Jane to give her &quot;entire&quot; self, including her heart, to the cause.&#10;&#10;Jane, on the other hand, feels that St. John is asking too much of her.

Jane perceives St. John's demand as excessive and unreasonable, wanting to retain her individuality and sense of self while contributing to the religious cause.&#10;&#10;In addition, their conflict is heightened by St. John's lack of empathy for Jane's feelings and reluctance to respect her boundaries. He dismisses Jane's concerns and insists on her complete devotion, showing no interest in reconciliation when he feels offended. This inflexibility and disregard for Jane's emotional needs create tension and frustration between the two characters, deepening their conflict.">

This reaction underscores the lack of genuine affection in their relationship and highlights Jane's growing awareness that she must &quot;disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent&quot; in order to please St. John.&#10;&#10;The kiss also serves as a reminder of the impossibility of meeting St. John's exacting standards, as he wants to &quot;train [Jane] to an elevation I could never reach.&quot; The gravity and quiescence with which Jane submits to the daily ritual of the kiss suggest her growing resignation to this reality, even as she wishes more to please him.&#10;&#10;Overall, the significance of St. John's kiss in their relationship is that it highlights the power imbalance between them, underscores the lack of genuine affection, and represents a symbolic fetter or constraint on Jane's freedom and individuality. The kiss serves as a reminder of the impossible standards St. John sets for her, and the obligation and resignation she feels in response to his expectations.">

I could not have believed it of her!&quot;&#10;&#10;St. John met this outbreak calmly: his brow unknit, his voice still even--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is a fact, however, and must be borne with.&quot;&#10;&#10;And again he was silent.

He sat down to dinner with us;&#10;he even tried to join in our conversation: but it was a failure--he could&#10;not manage it: whether from inability or disinclination, I cannot say.&#10;He left the table and went into the drawing-room before we had finished&#10;our dessert.

I knew not what passed between them;&#10;but I perceived that when they rejoined me, his arm was round her waist,&#10;and that he seemed to repose more confidence on her than before.  What&#10;had taken place, I found out afterwards.

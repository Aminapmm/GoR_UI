    <node id="1. Nationality: The speakers discuss the difference between Canadian and American usage of &quot;eh.&quot; Canadians are said to use it more frequently and distinctly than Americans. Some Americans may use it, but it is less common and could be mistaken for other sounds like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Linguistic transcription: The speakers also discuss the challenge in transcribing various sounds such as &quot;UH&quot;, &quot;EH&quot;, and &quot;AH&quot;. They mention that similar sounds might be transcribed differently based on the speaker's glottis, enunciation, and other factors. There could be inconsistencies in transcribing the same sound in different parts of a corpus due to factors like context or the transcriber's judgment.&#10;&#10;3. Sound duration and quality: The speakers briefly touch upon the differences in sound duration and quality that can affect transcription, such as &quot;eeh&quot; having a longer duration than &quot;eh.&quot; They also mention that sounds closer to &quot;EH&quot; might be transcribed as such, while similar sounds with slight variations could be represented differently.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speakers highlight the challenges in transcribing speech, particularly when dealing with similar-sounding words or regional dialects and accents." />

    <node id="The concern with having a single tag to remove read speech when dealing with variations such as &quot;read letters&quot; is that it might not be clear whether the tag should be applied to the whole phrase or just the word &quot;read&quot;.

    <node id="1. Single digit numbers are easier for a recognizer to identify because they are more predictable and consistent. The recognizer can perform better on single digits compared to multi-digit numbers or number ranges.&#10;&#10;2. Allowing flexibility in choosing between &quot;zero&quot; and &quot;O&quot; provides more natural and varied input, as people may use both forms interchangeably based on context. This helps the recognizer handle real-world variations in speech.&#10;&#10;3. Not strictly requiring groups of numbers adds flexibility to the data collection process, making it easier for annotators or participants to provide spoken digit inputs without worrying about specific patterns or formatting.&#10;&#10;4. Allowing more digit data to be collected can help improve the overall performance and robustness of the recognizer by providing a larger dataset with diverse examples.&#10;&#10;5. Recognizing digits is easier for a recognizer compared to numbers, which may have different pronunciations based on context (e.g., &quot;seven point five&quot;). Digits are more consistently pronounced, making it easier for the recognizer to identify them accurately.&#10;&#10;6. Allowing variations such as inserting hyphens between the numbers in a group can help break up the monotony of spoken digits and improve recognizability, especially if there is no specific pattern or format required for digit groups. This can provide more flexibility and naturalness to the input data." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the speakers are discussing the importance of keeping duplicate copies of their original data, even though it may require additional disk space. The necessity for this stems from two main reasons:&#10;&#10;1. Different microphone positions: For future research, they plan to use different microphone positions, which might affect the quality and consistency of the data. Keeping duplicates of the original data will ensure that they have a reliable reference point for comparison and analysis.&#10;2. Adaptation issues: They mention that there are challenges in adapting to new acoustic situations using their current dataset. By having more digit data, they can potentially improve acoustic adaptation in different recording conditions or with various microphones.&#10;&#10;While some participants express concerns about the effort required to duplicate the original TI-digits due to differences in recording situations, others argue that maintaining a core dataset of American speakers' recordings will help create a more reliable and consistent reference point for their research. By doing so, they can also better address random errors and maintain a stratified sample with respect to dialect groups." />

    <node id="1. Differences in nationality: Canadians are said to use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. Some Americans may use it, but it is less common and could be mistaken for other sounds like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Linguistic transcription challenges: The speakers discuss the challenge in transcribing various sounds such as &quot;UH&quot;, &quot;EH&quot;, and &quot;AH&quot;. Similar sounds might be transcribed differently based on the speaker's glottis, enunciation, and other factors. There could be inconsistencies in transcribing the same sound in different parts of a corpus due to factors like context or the transcriber's judgment.&#10;&#10;3. Sound duration and quality: The speakers briefly touch upon the differences in sound duration and quality that can affect transcription, such as &quot;eeh&quot; having a longer duration than &quot;eh.&quot; Sounds closer to &quot;EH&quot; might be transcribed as such, while similar sounds with slight variations could be represented differently.&#10;&#10;Overall, the discussion highlights the challenges in transcribing speech, particularly when dealing with similar-sounding words or regional dialects and accents. While some American speakers may use the word &quot;eh,&quot; it is less common and could be mistaken for other similar-sounding words such as &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot; Further systematic analysis would be needed to determine the extent of its use in American English." />

    <node id="1. Context of TI-digits: The TI-digits were read in a studio setting as part of an acoustic study. However, there is no further information provided about the specific context or purpose of the TI-digits reading.&#10;2. Comparison to OGI's &quot;reading zipcode stuff&quot;: The conversation suggests that the OGI's &quot;reading zipcode stuff&quot; might be similar to the TI-digits, but it is unclear how they are related. No detailed comparison has been made in this transcript. Both seem to be datasets used for acoustic analysis, and cross-corpus comparisons might be difficult due to differences between speakers' individual glottis sounds, enunciation, and other factors.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the information provided is limited by the transcript and may not give a complete picture of the context or comparison in question." />

    <node id="1. Individual human glottis vocal sounds: Each person's glottis (the space between the vocal cords) creates unique sounds. This means that even when reading the same material, two different people might produce slightly varying sounds for the same word or digit.&#10;&#10;2. Enunciation: The way individuals pronounce and articulate words can differ. Some may speak clearly and deliberately, while others might mumble or slur their speech, leading to differences in sound quality and transcription.&#10;&#10;3. Collection methods used in creating a corpus: The TI-digits corpus was created in a studio setting, whereas the OGI's &quot;reading zipcode stuff&quot; could have been collected in a different context. This might affect the speakers' performances and the consistency of the data, as they may adapt to new acoustic situations differently.&#10;&#10;4. Nationality: The speakers mention that Canadians use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. While some American speakers might use it, its usage is less common and could be mistaken for other similar-sounding words like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot;&#10;&#10;5. Sound duration and quality: Subtle differences in sound duration and quality can affect transcription. For example, the sound &quot;eeh&quot; might have a longer duration than &quot;eh,&quot; leading to different transcriptions based on context and the transcribers' judgment.&#10;&#10;6. Transcription challenges: Similar sounds may be transcribed differently depending on the speaker's glottis, enunciation, and other factors. This can lead to inconsistencies in transcribing the same sound across a corpus due to factors like context or the transcriber's judgment." />
    <node id="1. The interest in transcribing checking procedures revolved around handling items within curly brackets, which were identified as comments or annotations within the text. There were four types of comments noted during the discussion.&#10;   &#10;2. To improve transcription accuracy, Grad D suggested having a separate tag for the word &quot;read&quot; when it appears in phrases like &quot;read letters.&quot; This would help clarify whether the tag should be applied to just &quot;read&quot; or the entire phrase. The group generally agreed to consider this option for better system robustness.&#10;&#10;3. Regarding the steps discussed for dealing with a large number of words in natural speech, the focus was on working with various sounds such as &quot;UH&quot;, &quot;EH&quot;, and &quot;AH&quot;. These similar-sounding words can be transcribed differently based on factors like the speaker's glottis, enunciation, context, and transcriber's judgment.&#10;&#10;4. The speakers also touched upon differences in sound duration and quality that can affect transcription. For example, sounds closer to &quot;EH&quot; might be transcribed as such, while similar sounds with slight variations could be represented differently. This emphasizes the challenges in transcribing speech, particularly when dealing with regional dialects and accents." />

    <node id="1. Prosody and Use of &quot;EH,&quot; &quot;AH,&quot; and &quot;UH&quot;: The speakers discuss the challenges of transcribing similar-sounding words such as &quot;EH,&quot; &quot;AH,&quot; and &quot;UH.&quot; Prosody, or the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, can affect how these sounds are perceived and transcribed. For example, the duration of a sound might influence its transcription, with longer sounds being represented as &quot;EEH&quot; instead of &quot;EH.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Differences between Canadian and American Speakers: Canadians are said to use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. Some Americans may use it, but it is less common and could be mistaken for other sounds like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot; This difference in usage might be due to regional dialects and accents.&#10;&#10;3. Dictation and Speech: There is no direct connection between the discussion of &quot;EH,&quot; &quot;AH,&quot; and &quot;UH&quot; and the idea of someone dictating while they died. The speakers do not address this topic explicitly. However, the transcription challenges mentioned in the conversation might be relevant to transcribing audio recordings of a person dictating just before their death, as prosody and similar-sounding words could affect the accuracy of the transcription. A systematic analysis would be needed to determine if there is any correlation between the two topics." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the following steps in the editing process have been discussed:&#10;&#10;1. Transcribers convert spoken conversations into text.&#10;2. A first pass of transcribing is done to generate a draft transcript.&#10;3. Postdoc E performs quality checks and sanitization on the draft transcript, focusing on items within curly brackets, which are comments or annotations in the text. There are four types of such comments identified during the discussion.&#10;4. Grad D suggested having a separate tag for the word &quot;read&quot; when it appears in phrases like &quot;read letters,&quot; to improve system robustness and transcription accuracy.&#10;&#10;As per the conversation, there is no explicit mention of any other steps that need to be addressed in the editing process. However, they do touch upon challenges related to transcribing various sounds such as &quot;UH&quot;, &quot;EH&quot;, and &quot;AH&quot; which can have different transcriptions depending on factors like the speaker's glottis, enunciation, context, and transcriber's judgment. The participants also mention differences in sound duration and quality that can impact transcription.&#10;&#10;In summary, the main steps in the editing process discussed include transcribing, drafting, quality checks focusing on comments or annotations within curly brackets, and improving system robustness for better transcription accuracy.

In this context, it could mean that the slash is not a planned part of the pattern but rather an unintended consequence of another process or rule. This interpretation is based on Postdoc E's comment about finding it interesting and considering it an epiphenomenon. The specific nature and implications of this epiphenomenon are not clear from the transcript, as they might have been discussed in more detail later in the conversation." />

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss various aspects related to data compression, specifically dealing with shortening waveforms in a lossless manner and the appropriate formats for storing such compressed files. They also touch upon topics like disk space allocation and downsampling of sound files.&#10;2. The appropriate person to ask about lossless compression of shortened waveforms is Grad D, as acknowledged by Grad C during the meeting.

    <node id="1. The group, at the suggestion of Grad D, is considering changing some tags to &quot;digits&quot;. This would improve accuracy in transcription and annotation, especially in cases where it's unclear whether a 'read' tag should be applied to just the word 'read' or the whole phrase 'read speech'.&#10;2. Postdoc E has been thinking about changing certain tags to &quot;digits&quot;, but is concerned with making sure the scripts can handle this change. PhD B agrees and suggests that it would make it easier for people to tell the difference between different types of digits (e.g., those in a word versus those in a non-word context).&#10;3. PhD G points out that, while it might be easy for humans to distinguish between these digit types, having separate tags would enable them to perform counts more easily without processing. They also acknowledge that they could use the current system, but it might not be as safe or accurate.&#10;4. Postdoc E and Grad C bring up the idea of adding a &quot;numbers&quot; tag to better organize the transcripts. The group agrees this is a good idea, and Postdoc E confirms they've already added this tag.&#10;5. Discussion ensues about possibly including hyphens between numbers in a group or sequence. Professor F asks whether six dash one would be an acceptable format, to which Grad D responds that it might help with organization.&#10;6. PhD G expresses their desire to avoid having only one specific grouping of digits and suggests that they could learn to read them as digits if necessary. Postdoc E agrees.&#10;7. The discussion moves towards the potential research benefits of analyzing the prosodic form of digits in different contexts, but no one expresses immediate interest in pursuing this line of research.&#10;8. Towards the end, Postdoc E asks if they are done discussing digits, and Grad D raises the issue of overlapping digits. The group briefly discusses the potential cognitive load involved with this idea before moving on to other topics." />

However, they do touch upon topics related to data compression and storage formats which are relevant to handling large files.&#10;&#10;1. Lossless Compression of Shortened Waveforms: Grad C expressed uncertainty about who could provide specifics on various compression algorithms for this purpose, but Grad D was identified as the appropriate person to ask. This suggests that there may be different opinions or approaches when it comes to losslessly compressing shortened waveforms in a way that minimizes file size without sacrificing information integrity.&#10;&#10;2. Disk Space Allocation and Downsampling of Sound Files: Don mentioned disk space and storage formats, which implies considerations for managing memory usage during processing. Additionally, they discussed downsampling sound files, which can reduce file sizes at the cost of audio quality. This could be a trade-off between file size and convenience versus audio fidelity.&#10;&#10;3. Transcription Challenges: The participants also discussed difficulties in transcribing natural speech due to variations in pronunciation, accent, enunciation, and context. While not directly related to processing large files, these challenges can impact the efficiency and accuracy of transcription, which is a crucial step in managing audio data files.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific opinions regarding the best way to process large files were not expressed during the meeting, the discussion did touch upon relevant topics such as lossless compression algorithms, disk space allocation, downsampling sound files, and transcription challenges that could inform decisions about processing large files with considerations for file size, memory usage, and convenience." />
    <node id="1. Yes, the transcript indicates that the 'PTA' being discussed in the meeting is related to topics about children. This can be seen when PhD G says, &quot;and the PTA was in these, uh, topics about children.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. The repeated instances of 'OK' appearing in the conversation are not necessarily due to misunderstandings or mishearings of acronyms but could be a result of speakers using the word 'OK' interchangeably with 'uh' or 'ah' as filler words. There is also a possibility that some instances of 'OK' might have been intended as agreement or confirmation, while others could simply be hesitation sounds that were transcribed as 'OK'. The transcript does not provide enough context to definitively explain all occurrences of 'OK'." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the group wanted to discuss the timing and order of certain processes related to channelized data. Grad C was unsure whether they should wait until time markings are adjusted before starting to process and branch off into their layer of transcripts. The adjustments being made to the time bins involve combining previously separate bins where words might have been cut off, which is done to ensure that no word is lost in the compression process. This discussion indicates that the group is trying to determine the most efficient way to reduce the size of time bins while preserving the integrity of the data." />
    <node id="1. The speakers plan to perform some hand-editing on the extracted audio files and have them labeled by speaker ID and microphone type using the speaker form. This process is for organizing and managing the transcribed digits more efficiently.&#10;2. There is a limitation on the usable transcribed material due to permission concerns. However, Grad D mentioned that they spoke with Jane about it and decided it's probably not an issue since they edit out any errors anyway. The transcribed material will be used for research purposes, particularly looking at the prosodic form of the digits in different contexts.&#10;3. Additionally, there is a plan to elicit different prosodics with Liz by trying various methods, as the initial attempt with written-out digits in English did not work well." />

This confusion highlights the potential for misunderstandings when using specialized or context-dependent abbreviations in conversations (Transcript point 2)." />

For example, the duration of a sound might influence its transcription, with longer sounds being represented as &quot;EEH&quot; instead of &quot;EH.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Differences between Canadian and American Speakers: Canadians are said to use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. Some Americans may use it, but it is less common and could be mistaken for other sounds like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot; This difference in usage might be due to regional dialects and accents.&#10;&#10;3.

The speakers do not address this topic explicitly. However, the transcription challenges mentioned in the conversation might be relevant to transcribing audio recordings of a person dictating just before their death, as prosody and similar-sounding words could affect the accuracy of the transcription. A systematic analysis would be needed to determine if there is any correlation between the two topics.">

Postdoc E wrote a script that retrieves terms in curly brackets, which are typically used as comments or annotations within the text. They also classified acronyms and included underscores between their components for better clarity. For example, &quot;ACL&quot; would be tagged as &quot;A_C_L.&quot;&#10;3. According to Postdoc E, these terms did occur in the meetings being referred to, as they wrote scripts to retrieve and process items in curly brackets specifically for this purpose.">

Yes, the transcript indicates that the 'PTA' being discussed in the meeting is related to topics about children. This can be seen when PhD G says, &quot;and the PTA was in these, uh, topics about children.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. The repeated instances of 'OK' appearing in the conversation are not necessarily due to misunderstandings or mishearings of acronyms but could be a result of speakers using the word 'OK' interchangeably with 'uh' or 'ah' as filler words. There is also a possibility that some instances of 'OK' might have been intended as agreement or confirmation, while others could simply be hesitation sounds that were transcribed as 'OK'. The transcript does not provide enough context to definitively explain all occurrences of 'OK'.">

For example, the duration of a sound might influence its transcription, with longer sounds being represented as &quot;EEH&quot; instead of &quot;EH.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Differences between Canadian and American Speakers: Canadians are said to use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. Some Americans may use it, but it is less common and could be mistaken for other sounds like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot; This difference in usage might be due to regional dialects and accents.&#10;&#10;3. Dictation and Speech: There is no direct connection between the discussion of &quot;EH,&quot; &quot;AH,&quot; and &quot;UH&quot; and the idea of someone dictating while they died. The speakers do not address this topic explicitly. However, the transcription challenges mentioned in the conversation might be relevant to transcribing audio recordings of a person dictating just before their death, as prosody and similar-sounding words could affect the accuracy of the transcription. A systematic analysis would be needed to determine if there is any correlation between the two topics.">

They also acknowledge that they could use the current system, but it might not be as safe or accurate.&#10;4. Postdoc E and Grad C bring up the idea of adding a &quot;numbers&quot; tag to better organize the transcripts.

Additionally, they discussed downsampling sound files, which can reduce file sizes at the cost of audio quality. This could be a trade-off between file size and convenience versus audio fidelity.&#10;&#10;3. Transcription Challenges: The participants also discussed difficulties in transcribing natural speech due to variations in pronunciation, accent, enunciation, and context. While not directly related to processing large files, these challenges can impact the efficiency and accuracy of transcription, which is a crucial step in managing audio data files.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific opinions regarding the best way to process large files were not expressed during the meeting, the discussion did touch upon relevant topics such as lossless compression algorithms, disk space allocation, downsampling sound files, and transcription challenges that could inform decisions about processing large files with considerations for file size, memory usage, and convenience.">

    <edge source="The concern with having a single tag to remove read speech when dealing with variations such as &quot;read letters&quot; is that it might not be clear whether the tag should be applied to the whole phrase or just the word &quot;read&quot;. Having a separate tag for &quot;read&quot; in this context would ensure more accurate transcription and annotation. This was suggested by Grad D, and the group generally agreed to consider this option to make the system more robust." target="Based on the transcript provided, the group wanted to discuss the timing and order of certain processes related to channelized data. Grad C was unsure whether they should wait until time markings are adjusted before starting to process and branch off into their layer of transcripts. The adjustments being made to the time bins involve combining previously separate bins where words might have been cut off, which is done to ensure that no word is lost in the compression process. This discussion indicates that the group is trying to determine the most efficient way to reduce the size of time bins while preserving the integrity of the data.">

Postdoc E has been thinking about changing certain tags to &quot;digits&quot;, but is concerned with making sure the scripts can handle this change. PhD B agrees and suggests that it would make it easier for people to tell the difference between different types of digits (e.g., those in a word versus those in a non-word context).&#10;3. PhD G points out that, while it might be easy for humans to distinguish between these digit types, having separate tags would enable them to perform counts more easily without processing.

Professor F asks whether six dash one would be an acceptable format, to which Grad D responds that it might help with organization.&#10;6. PhD G expresses their desire to avoid having only one specific grouping of digits and suggests that they could learn to read them as digits if necessary. Postdoc E agrees.&#10;7. The discussion moves towards the potential research benefits of analyzing the prosodic form of digits in different contexts, but no one expresses immediate interest in pursuing this line of research.&#10;8. Towards the end, Postdoc E asks if they are done discussing digits, and Grad D raises the issue of overlapping digits.

Individual human glottis vocal sounds: Each person's glottis (the space between the vocal cords) creates unique sounds. This means that even when reading the same material, two different people might produce slightly varying sounds for the same word or digit.&#10;&#10;2. Enunciation: The way individuals pronounce and articulate words can differ. Some may speak clearly and deliberately, while others might mumble or slur their speech, leading to differences in sound quality and transcription.&#10;&#10;3. Collection methods used in creating a corpus: The TI-digits corpus was created in a studio setting, whereas the OGI's &quot;reading zipcode stuff&quot; could have been collected in a different context. This might affect the speakers' performances and the consistency of the data, as they may adapt to new acoustic situations differently.&#10;&#10;4. Nationality: The speakers mention that Canadians use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. While some American speakers might use it, its usage is less common and could be mistaken for other similar-sounding words like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot;&#10;&#10;5. Sound duration and quality: Subtle differences in sound duration and quality can affect transcription. For example, the sound &quot;eeh&quot; might have a longer duration than &quot;eh,&quot; leading to different transcriptions based on context and the transcribers' judgment.&#10;&#10;6. Transcription challenges: Similar sounds may be transcribed differently depending on the speaker's glottis, enunciation, and other factors.

However, they do touch upon topics related to data compression and storage formats which are relevant to handling large files.&#10;&#10;1. Lossless Compression of Shortened Waveforms: Grad C expressed uncertainty about who could provide specifics on various compression algorithms for this purpose, but Grad D was identified as the appropriate person to ask. This suggests that there may be different opinions or approaches when it comes to losslessly compressing shortened waveforms in a way that minimizes file size without sacrificing information integrity.&#10;&#10;2. Disk Space Allocation and Downsampling of Sound Files: Don mentioned disk space and storage formats, which implies considerations for managing memory usage during processing. Additionally, they discussed downsampling sound files, which can reduce file sizes at the cost of audio quality. This could be a trade-off between file size and convenience versus audio fidelity.&#10;&#10;3. Transcription Challenges: The participants also discussed difficulties in transcribing natural speech due to variations in pronunciation, accent, enunciation, and context. While not directly related to processing large files, these challenges can impact the efficiency and accuracy of transcription, which is a crucial step in managing audio data files.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific opinions regarding the best way to process large files were not expressed during the meeting, the discussion did touch upon relevant topics such as lossless compression algorithms, disk space allocation, downsampling sound files, and transcription challenges that could inform decisions about processing large files with considerations for file size, memory usage, and convenience.">

Both seem to be datasets used for acoustic analysis, and cross-corpus comparisons might be difficult due to differences between speakers' individual glottis sounds, enunciation, and other factors.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the information provided is limited by the transcript and may not give a complete picture of the context or comparison in question." target="1. Individual human glottis vocal sounds: Each person's glottis (the space between the vocal cords) creates unique sounds. This means that even when reading the same material, two different people might produce slightly varying sounds for the same word or digit.&#10;&#10;2. Enunciation: The way individuals pronounce and articulate words can differ. Some may speak clearly and deliberately, while others might mumble or slur their speech, leading to differences in sound quality and transcription.&#10;&#10;3. Collection methods used in creating a corpus: The TI-digits corpus was created in a studio setting, whereas the OGI's &quot;reading zipcode stuff&quot; could have been collected in a different context. This might affect the speakers' performances and the consistency of the data, as they may adapt to new acoustic situations differently.&#10;&#10;4. Nationality: The speakers mention that Canadians use the word &quot;eh&quot; more frequently and distinctly than Americans. While some American speakers might use it, its usage is less common and could be mistaken for other similar-sounding words like &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ah.&quot;&#10;&#10;5. Sound duration and quality: Subtle differences in sound duration and quality can affect transcription. For example, the sound &quot;eeh&quot; might have a longer duration than &quot;eh,&quot; leading to different transcriptions based on context and the transcribers' judgment.&#10;&#10;6. Transcription challenges: Similar sounds may be transcribed differently depending on the speaker's glottis, enunciation, and other factors. This can lead to inconsistencies in transcribing the same sound across a corpus due to factors like context or the transcriber's judgment.">

The group, at the suggestion of Grad D, is considering changing some tags to &quot;digits&quot;. This would improve accuracy in transcription and annotation, especially in cases where it's unclear whether a 'read' tag should be applied to just the word 'read' or the whole phrase 'read speech'.&#10;2. Postdoc E has been thinking about changing certain tags to &quot;digits&quot;, but is concerned with making sure the scripts can handle this change. PhD B agrees and suggests that it would make it easier for people to tell the difference between different types of digits (e.g., those in a word versus those in a non-word context).&#10;3. PhD G points out that, while it might be easy for humans to distinguish between these digit types, having separate tags would enable them to perform counts more easily without processing. They also acknowledge that they could use the current system, but it might not be as safe or accurate.&#10;4. Postdoc E and Grad C bring up the idea of adding a &quot;numbers&quot; tag to better organize the transcripts. The group agrees this is a good idea, and Postdoc E confirms they've already added this tag.&#10;5. Discussion ensues about possibly including hyphens between numbers in a group or sequence. Professor F asks whether six dash one would be an acceptable format, to which Grad D responds that it might help with organization.&#10;6. PhD G expresses their desire to avoid having only one specific grouping of digits and suggests that they could learn to read them as digits if necessary. Postdoc E agrees.&#10;7. The discussion moves towards the potential research benefits of analyzing the prosodic form of digits in different contexts, but no one expresses immediate interest in pursuing this line of research.&#10;8. Towards the end, Postdoc E asks if they are done discussing digits, and Grad D raises the issue of overlapping digits. The group briefly discusses the potential cognitive load involved with this idea before moving on to other topics.">

An epiphenomenon refers to a secondary phenomenon that occurs alongside or because of a primary phenomenon.

    <edge source="1. The group, at the suggestion of Grad D, is considering changing some tags to &quot;digits&quot;. This would improve accuracy in transcription and annotation, especially in cases where it's unclear whether a 'read' tag should be applied to just the word 'read' or the whole phrase 'read speech'.&#10;2. Postdoc E has been thinking about changing certain tags to &quot;digits&quot;, but is concerned with making sure the scripts can handle this change. PhD B agrees and suggests that it would make it easier for people to tell the difference between different types of digits (e.g., those in a word versus those in a non-word context).&#10;3. PhD G points out that, while it might be easy for humans to distinguish between these digit types, having separate tags would enable them to perform counts more easily without processing. They also acknowledge that they could use the current system, but it might not be as safe or accurate.&#10;4. Postdoc E and Grad C bring up the idea of adding a &quot;numbers&quot; tag to better organize the transcripts. The group agrees this is a good idea, and Postdoc E confirms they've already added this tag.&#10;5. Discussion ensues about possibly including hyphens between numbers in a group or sequence. Professor F asks whether six dash one would be an acceptable format, to which Grad D responds that it might help with organization.&#10;6. PhD G expresses their desire to avoid having only one specific grouping of digits and suggests that they could learn to read them as digits if necessary. Postdoc E agrees.&#10;7. The discussion moves towards the potential research benefits of analyzing the prosodic form of digits in different contexts, but no one expresses immediate interest in pursuing this line of research.&#10;8. Towards the end, Postdoc E asks if they are done discussing digits, and Grad D raises the issue of overlapping digits. The group briefly discusses the potential cognitive load involved with this idea before moving on to other topics." target=" said .&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc E&#10;Content: You know , I mean , as I said I was considering changing it to &quot; digits &quot; .

    <edge source="The meeting transcript does not explicitly discuss the best way to process large files in terms of file size, memory usage, and convenience. However, they do touch upon topics related to data compression and storage formats which are relevant to handling large files.&#10;&#10;1. Lossless Compression of Shortened Waveforms: Grad C expressed uncertainty about who could provide specifics on various compression algorithms for this purpose, but Grad D was identified as the appropriate person to ask. This suggests that there may be different opinions or approaches when it comes to losslessly compressing shortened waveforms in a way that minimizes file size without sacrificing information integrity.&#10;&#10;2. Disk Space Allocation and Downsampling of Sound Files: Don mentioned disk space and storage formats, which implies considerations for managing memory usage during processing. Additionally, they discussed downsampling sound files, which can reduce file sizes at the cost of audio quality. This could be a trade-off between file size and convenience versus audio fidelity.&#10;&#10;3. Transcription Challenges: The participants also discussed difficulties in transcribing natural speech due to variations in pronunciation, accent, enunciation, and context. While not directly related to processing large files, these challenges can impact the efficiency and accuracy of transcription, which is a crucial step in managing audio data files.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific opinions regarding the best way to process large files were not expressed during the meeting, the discussion did touch upon relevant topics such as lossless compression algorithms, disk space allocation, downsampling sound files, and transcription challenges that could inform decisions about processing large files with considerations for file size, memory usage, and convenience." target="1.

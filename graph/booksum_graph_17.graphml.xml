<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" Mary Ingram, Amy, and Louisa Eshton required permission from Miss Ingram to visit the library because she was the one who had initially gone to see the fortune-teller and they were afraid to go alone. The nervous reactions inside the library could be attributed to the fact that the fortune-teller seemed to know a lot of personal details about them, such as things they had said and done when they were children, books and ornaments in their boudoirs, keepsakes presented by different relations, and even their thoughts and desires. This accurate and specific information made them believe that the fortune-teller was not an ordinary person but possibly a witch or someone with supernatural abilities, which caused their fear and nervous reactions."/>
<node id="!&quot; was her mama's cry; but&#10;she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which&#10;Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.&#10;&#10;A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it &quot;le cas&quot; to wring&#10;her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for&#10;her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under&#10;their breath, and looked a little frightened.&#10;&#10;The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-&#10;door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.&#10;&#10;Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a&#10;glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and&#10;coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to&#10;her seat, and took it in silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Blanche?&quot; said Lord Ingram.&#10;&#10;&quot;What did she say, sister?&quot; asked Mary.&#10;&#10;&quot;What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?&quot;&#10;demanded the"/>
<node id=" nearly half-an-hour: during all that&#10;time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more&#10;dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had&#10;obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from&#10;her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,&#10;notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to&#10;whatever revelations had been made her.&#10;&#10;{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}&#10;&#10;Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go&#10;alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through&#10;the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,&#10;till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,&#10;permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous&#10;Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.&#10;&#10;Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard&#10;hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and&#10;"/>
<node id="Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard&#10;hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and&#10;at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came&#10;running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure she is something not right!&quot; they cried, one and all.  &quot;She&#10;told us such things!  She knows all about us!&quot; and they sank breathless&#10;into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.&#10;&#10;Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of&#10;things they had said and done when they were mere children; described&#10;books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that&#10;different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had&#10;even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the&#10;name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what&#10;they most wished for.&#10;&#10;Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further&#10;enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,&#10;e"/>
<node id="?&quot; asked Mary.&#10;&#10;&quot;What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?&quot;&#10;demanded the Misses Eshton.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, now, good people,&quot; returned Miss Ingram, &quot;don't press upon me.&#10;Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,&#10;by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this&#10;matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who&#10;is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy&#10;vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry&#10;and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now&#10;I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow&#10;morning, as he threatened.&quot;&#10;&#10;Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further&#10;conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that&#10;time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more&#10;dissatisfied"/>
<node id="ort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two&#10;turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting&#10;gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on&#10;which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent&#10;talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a&#10;courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.&#10;Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord&#10;Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of&#10;the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant&#10;speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended&#10;their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after&#10;all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram&#10;were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an&#10;hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his&#10;guests; and his re-entrance"/>
<node id="ived the notion.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; I heard her say: &quot;she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the&#10;bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,&#10;was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a&#10;large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's&#10;cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell&#10;merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's&#10;party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of&#10;flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of&#10;Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of&#10;roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they&#10;drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,&#10;dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony&#10;followed,"/>
<node id=" In this social gathering, the characters play different roles that contribute to the overall atmosphere of the event. Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram are the central figures around whom the gathering revolves. Mr. Rochester's &quot;extreme pallor&quot; earlier in the evening suggests that he might have been anxious or worried about something, but his stern and firm appearance after drinking from the wine-glass indicates that he has regained his composure.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's presence is commanding, and he takes the lead in organizing the charades, selecting certain ladies to be on his team. He specifically chooses Miss Ingram, who is portrayed as a regal and captivating figure, often inclining her head towards Mr. Rochester and whispering to him, further emphasizing their connection and attraction.&#10;&#10;The other characters, such as Colonel Dent, Mrs. Dent, and the Misses Eshton, form smaller groups and engage in lively conversations and laughter, contributing to the high spirits of the gathering. Mr. Mason, who was initially thought to be melancholic, also appears to be in good spirits, engaging in conversation with Colonel and Mrs. Dent.&#10;&#10;The atmosphere of the group is significantly affected by Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram's presence, as they are the focus of attention and interest. Their interactions suggest an impending marriage, which might be a topic of discussion and speculation among the other guests. The jovial and animated atmosphere of the gathering also highlights the social dynamics of the group, where individuals engage with one another based on their connections, interests, and shared social status.&#10;&#10;Overall, the various characters play roles that contribute to the social hierarchy and dynamics of the gathering, with Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram at the center, influencing the atmosphere through their interactions and presence."/>
<node id="&#10;&quot;Now, Dent,&quot; continued Mr. Rochester, &quot;it is your turn.&quot;  And as the&#10;other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss&#10;Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners&#10;filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the&#10;actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my&#10;attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the&#10;arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What&#10;charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they&#10;acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the&#10;consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss&#10;Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,&#10;till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his&#10;cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged&#10;glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle&#10;returns in memory at this moment.&#10;&#10;I have told you"/>
<node id=" said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was&#10;arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood&#10;about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.&#10;Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and&#10;animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.&#10;Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw&#10;Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a&#10;liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more&#10;firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!&quot; he said.  He swallowed the&#10;contents and returned it to me.  &quot;What are they doing, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Laughing and talking, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something&#10;strange?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all: they are full of jests and ga"/>
<node id=" will she manage to please him when they are&#10;married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;&#10;and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun&#10;shines on.&quot;&#10;&#10;I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of&#10;marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first&#10;discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely&#10;to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but&#10;the longer I considered the position, education, &amp;c., of the parties, the&#10;less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram&#10;for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,&#10;doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:&#10;I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not&#10;fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take&#10;to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of&#10;the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan&#10;convinced me that"/>
<node id=" were carried to the boudoir within the&#10;drawing-room.&#10;&#10;Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was&#10;selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  &quot;Miss Ingram is&#10;mine, of course,&quot; said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and&#10;Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been&#10;fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you play?&quot; he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I&#10;rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my&#10;usual seat.&#10;&#10;He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which&#10;was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of&#10;the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should&#10;be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; I heard her say: &quot;she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ere long a"/>
<node id=" I were in fault.&#10;&#10;Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.&#10;He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.&#10;&#10;&quot;It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,&quot; said he, &quot;when my&#10;friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long&#10;journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate&#10;acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.&quot;&#10;&#10;His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being&#10;somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether&#10;English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and&#10;forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a&#10;fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you&#10;detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to&#10;please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large&#10;and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at&#10;least so I thought."/>
<node id=" introduced.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so&#10;many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow&#10;like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all&#10;the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with&#10;the most lively and the most continuous?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.&quot;  I said&#10;this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,&#10;manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected&#10;sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web&#10;of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for&#10;weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.&#10;&#10;&quot;Eagerness of a listener!&quot; repeated she: &quot;yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by&#10;the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight&#10;in their"/>
<node id=" In response to Mr. Rochester's instructions, the narrator (Jane Eyre) carried out the following actions:&#10;&#10;1. She approached Mr. Mason and whispered in his ear that Mr. Rochester was here and wished to see him.&#10;2. She escorted Mr. Mason to the library where Mr. Rochester was waiting.&#10;3. After ensuring Mr. Mason was received by Mr. Rochester, she left the room and went upstairs to her own chamber.&#10;&#10;These actions demonstrated Jane's loyalty and willingness to follow Mr. Rochester's wishes in several ways:&#10;&#10;1. She did not question Mr. Rochester's instructions or hesitate to carry them out, showing her trust and obedience towards him.&#10;2. She executed the tasks with confidence and determination, moving &quot;straight among&quot; the company and leading Mr. Mason to the library without hesitation.&#10;3. Her loyalty was also revealed through her concern for Mr. Rochester's well-being, as she felt relieved and went to sleep only after hearing his cheerful voice and knowing he was safe and sound.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's actions demonstrated her strong sense of loyalty, obedience, and care for Mr. Rochester, further solidifying their bond as employer and employee and hinting at her deeper feelings for him."/>
<node id=" she never offered, nor had, an&#10;opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did&#10;not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were&#10;not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a&#10;spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her&#10;away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;&#10;sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with&#10;coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these&#10;manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;&#10;the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended&#10;a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness&#10;of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this&#10;obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-&#10;torturing pain arose.&#10;&#10;I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,&#10;because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her&#10;his love"/>
<node id=" if I did, I should&#10;care nothing about it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, you could dare censure for my sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as&#10;you, I am sure, do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his&#10;ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here&#10;and then leave me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight&#10;among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him&#10;from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.&#10;&#10;At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors&#10;repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and&#10;heard him say, &quot;This way, Mason; this is your room.&quot;&#10;&#10;He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon&#10;asleep.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"/>
<node id=" Jane Eyre cannot manage to please Mr. Rochester and become the happiest woman in the world by trying to fit into his project of marrying for interest and connections. The reason is that she doesn't have the social status or wealth that he is looking for in a wife. Moreover, it is clear that Jane and Mr. Rochester are well-suited to each other because of their intellectual equality and mutual respect, which go beyond social standings and financial gains.&#10;&#10;To become Mr. Rochester's wife and potentially the happiest woman in the world, Jane needs to be true to herself and follow her heart. She must show Mr. Rochester that she can be a partner to him in every sense, not just a socially acceptable wife. Jane has already shown her loyalty, obedience, and care for Mr. Rochester, which are essential qualities for a successful marriage. However, she must also express her feelings for him and make him see that their love goes beyond social conventions.&#10;&#10;In the end, Jane does manage to please Mr. Rochester and become the happiest woman in the world, but not by trying to fit into his original plan of marrying for interest and connections. Instead, she stays true to herself and follows her heart, which leads her to a deeper and more meaningful relationship with Mr. Rochester."/>
<node id="admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really&#10;stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to&#10;witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;&#10;vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly&#10;pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled&#10;further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to&#10;be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.&#10;&#10;Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows&#10;that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell&#10;harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have&#10;quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,&#10;and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a&#10;silent conquest might have been won.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so&#10;near to him?&quot; I asked myself.  &quot;Surely she cannot truly like him, or not"/>
<node id=" listener!&quot; repeated she: &quot;yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by&#10;the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight&#10;in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to&#10;receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have&#10;noticed this?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not&#10;gratitude?&quot;&#10;&#10;I said nothing.&#10;&#10;&quot;You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen&#10;him married, and beheld his bride happy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What the devil have you seen, then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that&#10;Mr. Rochester is to be married?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shortly?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with&#10;an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you"/>
<node id=" interchanged&#10;glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle&#10;returns in memory at this moment.&#10;&#10;I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could&#10;not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice&#10;me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once&#10;turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions&#10;appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her&#10;robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me&#10;by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to&#10;merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would&#10;soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security&#10;in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a&#10;style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought&#10;than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its&#10;very pride, irresistible.&#10;&#10;There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though"/>
<node id=" The tall, fashionable-looking man who arrived in a post-chaise is named Mason, and he comes from the West Indies, specifically from Spanish Town in Jamaica. When Mr. Rochester left in the morning, he was riding Mesrour, his black horse, and Pilot, his dog was with him. However, when Mason arrived, there was no sign of Mesrour or Pilot, which made Miss Ingram exclaim, &quot;What has he done with the animals?&quot;"/>
<node id=" smile&#10;signify?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire&#10;now, I suppose?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room&#10;yonder are doing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,&#10;are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you&#10;left this morning?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of&#10;installing himself here till you returned.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The devil he did!  Did he give his name?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish&#10;Town, in Jamaica, I think.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead&#10;me to a chair."/>
<node id="&quot;What can possess him to come home in that style?&quot; said Miss Ingram.  &quot;He&#10;rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot&#10;was with him:--what has he done with the animals?&quot;&#10;&#10;As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so&#10;near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking&#10;of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when&#10;she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The&#10;post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman&#10;alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was&#10;a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.&#10;&#10;&quot;How provoking!&quot; exclaimed Miss Ingram: &quot;you tiresome monkey!&quot;&#10;(apostrophising Adele), &quot;who perched you up in the window to give false&#10;intelligence?&quot; and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.&#10;&#10;Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.&#10;He bowed to Lady Ingram"/>
<node id=" here.  I have scarcely interchanged a&#10;syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider&#10;some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,&#10;dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to&#10;be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling&#10;disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable&#10;with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is not at home.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this&#10;morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that&#10;circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as&#10;it were, out of existence?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme&#10;you had introduced.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so&#10;many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's"/>
<node id=" dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in&#10;Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know,&quot; said she, &quot;that, of the three characters, I liked you in&#10;the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant&#10;gentleman-highwayman you would have made!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is all the soot washed from my face?&quot; he asked, turning it towards her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your&#10;complexion than that ruffian's rouge.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You would like a hero of the road then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian&#10;bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour&#10;since, in the presence of all these witnesses.&quot;  She giggled, and her&#10;colour rose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Dent,&quot; continued Mr. Rochester, &quot;it is your turn.&quot;  And as the&#10;other party withdrew, he and his band took the"/>
<node id=" light of the&#10;girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an&#10;arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if&#10;he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference&#10;be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek&#10;gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated&#10;keen-eyed dog, its guardian.&#10;&#10;He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship&#10;theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage&#10;that &quot;extremes meet.&quot;&#10;&#10;Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps&#10;of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much&#10;sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary&#10;Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that&#10;reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they&#10;both called him &quot;a beautiful man.&quot;  Louisa said he was &quot;a love of a&#10;creat"/>
<node id=" The scene depicted is a social gathering at Mr. Rochester's estate, where the characters are engaged in playing charades. Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram are central figures in this gathering, often seen in deep conversation and exchanging whispers, which suggests their attraction and possible future marriage.&#10;&#10;In this particular charade, Mr. Rochester and the other party are acting out a scene, which is solved by Colonel Dent as &quot;Bridewell,&quot; an English prison. The text suggests that they are playing out an Eastern or patriarchal narrative, but it does not provide specific details about their costumes or actions in this particular charade. However, the fact that they are acting as prisoners might imply a narrative of power dynamics, submission, and domination, which could be linked to Eastern or patriarchal societies.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the description of their costumes or actions in this specific charade is not provided in the text, so any assumptions about their attire or behavior would be speculative. The text primarily focuses on the overall atmosphere of the gathering and the interactions between Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram, rather than the details of the charades being performed."/>

The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table&#10;and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light&#10;proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.&#10;&#10;Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on&#10;his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though&#10;the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one&#10;arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the&#10;desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well&#10;have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were&#10;attached fetters.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bridewell!&quot; exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.&#10;&#10;A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their&#10;ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.

<node id=" No, Mr. Rochester's frequent smiles and eagerness to listen to certain 'fascinating lips' were not solely a result of being favored with the most lively and continuous tales about matrimony. The gipsy's observations suggest that there is a deeper emotional connection between Mr. Rochester and the individual with the captivating stories. The use of phrases like &quot;taking delight in their task of communicating&quot; and &quot;willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him&quot; indicate that Mr. Rochester finds pleasure and satisfaction in the company of this person. Although the text does not explicitly confirm the gipsy's insinuations, the strength of Mr. Rochester's reaction when he hears of a stranger's arrival suggests that he is expecting someone of importance. This could potentially be the individual to whom the gipsy is referring.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the lively tales of matrimony might have contributed to Mr. Rochester's attentiveness, there are stronger indications of a deeper emotional connection with the storyteller."/>
<node id=" After the fortune-telling scene with the mysterious woman in the library, Miss Ingram and the others had varying reactions. Miss Ingram returned from the library with a cold and stiff demeanor, not revealing anything about what the fortune-teller had said. She dismissed the experience as an ordinary palm reading and suggested that Mr. Eshton should put the fortune-teller in the stocks the next morning. However, her reaction was likely a cover-up, as she grew momently darker and more dissatisfied, not turning a page of her book for nearly half an hour.&#10;&#10;The Misses Eshton and Mary Ingram, on the other hand, were quite shaken by the experience. They claimed that the fortune-teller knew a lot of personal details about them, such as things they had said and done when they were children, books and ornaments in their boudoirs, keepsakes presented by different relations, and even their thoughts and desires. They were so frightened that they ran across the hall, sinking breathlessly into the chairs provided by the gentlemen.&#10;&#10;Despite the gentlemen's earnest petitions, Miss Ingram and the others did not reveal the specifics of what the fortune-teller had whispered in their ears regarding the person they liked best in the world and what they most wished for. It can be inferred that the fortune-teller had accurately revealed some intimate details, causing the ladies to be both amazed and frightened.&#10;&#10;As for Miss Ingram's private conversation with Mr. Rochester during the charade that followed, the narrator, Jane, did not provide any specific details. However, Jane did mention that she still sees the consultation which followed each scene, with Mr. Rochester turning to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram inclining her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek. She also recalls their mutual whisperings and interchanged glances, indicating that there was a strong attraction and connection between the two during that time."/>

She wonders if the speaker has any interest in or curiosity about any of the company present. The woman also questions the speaker's ambition of setting up a school in the future, implying that it is a modest and limited goal. She suggests that the speaker might be thinking of someone in particular and following their movements with interest.&#10;&#10;The woman's tone is one of curiosity and observation, as she tries to understand the speaker's thoughts and feelings. She seems to be implying that the speaker might have a romantic interest in someone in the room, and she challenges the speaker's ambition by suggesting that it is not a fulfilling enough goal for her spirit.&#10;&#10;Compared to the woman's own ambition, which is not specified but seems to be greater than the speaker's, the speaker's hope for the future seems limited and unfulfilling. The woman seems to be suggesting that the speaker should have a more ambitious goal for her future, one that goes beyond setting up a small school.&#10;&#10;Overall, the woman's questions and observations suggest that she is trying to understand the speaker's thoughts and feelings, and she is challenging her to have a more ambitious goal for her future."/>

<node id=" The observer, who is the narrator, Jane Eyre, is trying to understand the depths of Mr. Rochester's feelings and intentions regarding his impending marriage to Miss Ingram. Jane is both fearful and curious because she senses that there is more to Mr. Rochester's motivations than meets the eye, and she is uncertain about what she might discover. The rest of the party, including Mr. Rochester himself, seems to be preoccupied with their own interests and pleasures, leaving Jane free to observe and analyze their interactions. However, this also makes Jane feel isolated and somewhat anxious, as she is not fully part of the group and is instead an outsider looking in. The &quot;strange depths&quot; of Mr. Rochester's eye may refer to the complexity and mystery of his character, which Jane is trying to decipher."/>
<node id=" Based on the narrative, Miss Ingram can be described as lacking originality, insincere, and having limited intellect. She is portrayed as someone who repeats sounding phrases from books and never offers or has an opinion of her own. Her mind is described as poor and her heart as barren by nature. She is shown to be more concerned with appearances and social status than genuine emotions or relationships. The narrator, Jane Eyre, finds it difficult to describe her pain as jealousy because she believes that Miss Ingram is not a worthy object of such a feeling. Jane feels that Miss Ingram is not good, not genuine, and not capable of charming Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Therefore, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy."/>

Much too, you will think, reader, to engender&#10;jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a&#10;woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the&#10;nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss&#10;Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the&#10;feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very&#10;showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant&#10;attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing&#10;bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted&#10;by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to&#10;repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an&#10;opinion of her own.

If Miss Ingram had been a&#10;good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I&#10;should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:&#10;then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired&#10;her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:&#10;and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my&#10;admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.

It was a comfort; but,&#10;indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the&#10;interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and&#10;fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had&#10;expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to&#10;conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that&#10;living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had&#10;never thought of Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;what are you musing about?

<node id="&#10;&quot;Oh, I will go by all means,&quot; I answered: and I was glad of the&#10;unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped&#10;out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in&#10;one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door&#10;quietly behind me.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you like, miss,&quot; said Sam, &quot;I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she&#10;frightens you, just call and I'll come in.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.&quot;  Nor was&#10;I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if&#10;Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-&#10;corner.

<node id=" Based on the narrative, it is true that Mr. Rochester is planning to marry Miss Ingram. This is stated explicitly by the gipsy fortune-teller when she says, &quot;Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram&quot; in response to the speaker's question about Mr. Rochester's marriage. The speaker then confirms that &quot;appearances would warrant that conclusion.&quot; Additionally, when the tall, fashionable-looking man named Mason arrives, he assumes that Mr. Rochester is not at home because he is with his new wife, Miss Ingram, indicating that their marriage is a widely known fact."/>
<node id=" Based on the observations and conversations in the room, the stranger, named Mason, is described as a &quot;beautiful man&quot; with a sleek and meek appearance, while Mr. Rochester is described as a fierce and rough-coated falcon or a keen-eyed dog, his guardian. This creates a stark contrast between the two men, with Mason appearing more refined and elegant, and Mr Rochester appearing more intense and powerful. Additionally, the way each man is associated with animals - Mason with a sleek gander and Mr. Rochester with a fierce falcon and a rough-coated dog - further highlights their differences. The guests also note that Mr. Rochester has been the center of attention and the recipient of many smiles from the ladies, indicating his popularity and charm. In contrast, there is no mention of the stranger receiving similar attention, suggesting that he is less engaging or less well-known to the guests."/>
<node id=" After the fortune-telling session in the library, Miss Ingram returned with a cold and stiff demeanor, dismissing the experience as an ordinary palm reading. However, she grew darker and more dissatisfied, not turning a page of her book for nearly half an hour. The Misses Eshton and Mary Ingram, on the other hand, were quite shaken and claimed that the fortune-teller knew personal details about them. They were so frightened that they ran across the hall and sunk breathlessly into the chairs provided by the gentlemen. Despite the gentlemen's petitions, the ladies did not reveal the specifics of what the fortune-teller had whispered in their ears.&#10;&#10;The community's perception of Jane's abilities as a fortune-teller is not explicitly stated in the narrative. However, it is mentioned that the fortune-teller (who is revealed to be Mr. Rochester in disguise) seemed to know a lot of personal details about Miss Ingram and the others, which made them believe that she was not an ordinary person but possibly a witch or someone with supernatural abilities. This caused their fear and nervous reactions. When the tall, fashionable-looking man named Mason arrives, he assumes that Mr. Rochester is not at home because he is with his new wife, Miss Ingram, indicating that their marriage is a widely known fact."/>
<node id=" The ladies should handle the persistent old fortune-teller by setting clear boundaries and standing firm. They initially try to persuade her to leave, but when she refuses, they should not give in to the pressure from the men to encourage her stay. Mrs. Lynn and the Dowager Ingram object to the idea, and the footman reports that the fortune-teller is &quot;quite troublesome.&quot; Mr. Eshton even threatens to put her in the stocks. However, Blanche Ingram insists on having her fortune told, and the other ladies follow her lead.&#10;&#10;When the fortune-teller refuses to see anyone except the young and single ladies, Blanche takes charge and insists on seeing her alone in the library.

<node id=" It is natural to find it difficult to stop loving someone once you have developed feelings for them, even if they are ignoring you or paying attention to someone else. In the narrative provided, Jane Eyre, the protagonist, has learned to love Mr. Rochester, and she cannot stop doing so even when he ignores her and showers his attentions on another woman, Miss Ingram. This is because the feeling of love is not solely based on reciprocation or attention; it is also influenced by the emotional connection, respect, and admiration that Jane has for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not dependent on his careless and prideful courtship of Miss Ingram. Instead, Jane recognizes the superficiality of their relationship and believes that she could have succeeded in winning his heart if she had approached him differently. However, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not based on manipulation or strategy; it is grounded in her genuine appreciation for his personality and their intellectual equality.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Mr. Rochester is ignoring Jane and paying attention to someone else, she cannot stop loving him because her feelings are based on a deeper connection that goes beyond social conventions and external displays of affection."/>
<node id=" The gipsy's observations about Mr. Rochester's happiness being &quot;carefully laid&quot; aside for him and depending on his own actions to &quot;stretch out his hand, and take it up&quot; are based on her interpretations of his facial expressions and behavior. The gipsy seems to have a keen sense of observation and a belief that people's true feelings and emotions can be read through their gestures, looks, and eyes.&#10;&#10;When the gipsy observes Mr. Rochester's eyes, she notes that they &quot;shine like dew&quot; and are &quot;soft and full of feeling,&quot; indicating a susceptible and emotional nature. She also interprets his &quot;unconscious lassitude&quot; and &quot;melancholy resulting from loneliness&quot; as signs of his inner longing and dissatisfaction with his current situation.&#10;&#10;The gipsy's belief that Mr. Rochester's happiness depends on his own actions suggests that she sees him as having the power to choose his own path and create his own happiness, rather than being passive and waiting for it to come to him. This interpretation is consistent with the gipsy's earlier statement that she likes to observe people and study their gestures and looks, as if she is trying to understand their true motivations and desires.&#10;&#10;The physical discomfort that Mr. Rochester feels from kneeling too close to the fire is separate from the happiness that the gipsy is referring to. While Mr. Rochester may experience physical discomfort, the gipsy is suggesting that he also has the potential for deeper emotional fulfillment if he chooses to pursue it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the gipsy's observations and interpretations are based on her ability to read people's emotions and motivations through their gestures, looks, and behavior. While her interpretations may not be entirely accurate, they suggest that she sees Mr. Rochester as a complex and multifaceted individual who has the power to create his own happiness if he chooses to do so."/>

<node id=" Based on the narrative, the interaction and connection between Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram during the charade performance by Colonel Dent's party were characterized by their close proximity, whispered conversations, and exchanged glances. While the specific details of the charade are not provided, the text suggests that Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram were deeply engaged in their own private conversation, rather than paying close attention to the performance. Their behavior indicates a strong attraction and connection between them, with Miss Ingram often leaning in towards Mr. Rochester and whispering in his ear, and Mr. Rochester responding in kind. These actions suggest a flirtatious and romantic dynamic between the two characters, further emphasized by Miss Ingram's playful suggestion that she would have liked Mr. Rochester as a &quot;gallant gentleman-highwayman&quot; or an &quot;Italian bandit.&quot; Overall, the nature of their interaction during the charade performance suggests a strong mutual attraction and a possible future marriage."/>
<node id=" The gipsy is described as an old woman with a strange face that looks all brown and black, and she has white hair sticking out from under her hat. She is bent over a little black book, reading it by the firelight and muttering the words to herself. The narrator, who is entering the room for the first time, notices that the gipsy does not immediately look up from her reading when he arrives. Instead, she seems to want to finish what she is reading before acknowledging his presence.&#10;&#10;The narrator's initial reaction to the gipsy is one of curiosity and interest, rather than fear or unease. He describes feeling &quot;composed&quot; and notices that there is nothing about the gipsy's appearance that would trouble one's calm. When the gipsy finally looks up at him, he notices that her gaze is bold and direct.&#10;&#10;Overall, the gipsy's appearance and behavior suggest that she is a confident and self-assured individual who is deeply engrossed in her reading. The narrator's reaction to her presence reflects his open-mindedness and willingness to engage with new and unexpected experiences."/>

I felt now as composed&#10;as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's&#10;appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked&#10;up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she&#10;raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-&#10;locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,&#10;and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at&#10;once, with a bold and direct gaze.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, and"/>
<node id=" Mr. Rochester has a sudden reaction and exclaims about Mason and the West Indies because he has just heard that a man named Mason, who comes from the West Indies, has arrived at the house. This information triggers a spasm and distress in Mr. Rochester, possibly because he has a hidden connection or history with this person related to the West Indies.&#10;&#10;Jane tries to help Mr. Rochester in his distress by offering her support, both literally and figuratively. She asks if he feels ill and offers him her shoulder and arm for support when he appears to be unwell and about to stagger. She also shows concern and attentiveness by sitting beside him, holding his hand, and chafing it to help him recover."/>
<node id=" The nature of the interaction and relationship between Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram during the charade performance is one of strong attraction and a possible future marriage. They are deeply engaged in their own private conversation, rather than paying close attention to the charade performance. Their whispered conversations, close proximity, and exchanged glances suggest a flirtatious and romantic dynamic between the two characters. Miss Ingram's playful suggestion of wanting Mr. Rochester as a &quot;gallant gentleman-highwayman&quot; or an &quot;Italian bandit&quot; further emphasizes their mutual attraction. The way they interact with each other during the charade performance indicates a strong connection and a high likelihood of marriage between them."/>
<node id=" Mr. Rochester appears to be planning to marry Miss Ingram primarily for reasons of interest and connections, rather than out of love, as evidenced by his explicit statements and actions in the narrative. He is shown to be constantly aware of Miss Ingram's defects and limitations, suggesting a clear-eyed assessment of their compatibility rather than a passionate infatuation.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester's behavior during the charade performance, such as his whispered conversations and exchanged glances with Miss Ingram, indicate a strong attraction and connection between them, but not necessarily a deep emotional bond or love. This is supported by the fact that Mr. Rochester is aware of Miss Ingram's superficiality and lack of originality, and yet still plans to marry her, suggesting that he values her social status and connections more than her personality or character.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that Mr. Rochester is marrying Miss Ingram primarily for family or political reasons, rather than out of love, as evidenced by his clear-eyed assessment of her defects and his focus on her social status and connections."/>
<node id=" The speaker's suspicion and speculation during their conversation with Mr. Rochester revolve around his impending marriage to Miss Ingram. The speaker has noticed the frequent and lively conversations between Mr. Rochester and the ladies, as well as his apparent eagerness to listen to their stories. They infer that Mr. Rochester's behavior indicates an interest in matrimony, and when they learn from the gipsy fortune-teller that he is indeed getting married, they conclude it is to Miss Ingram due to the ladies' fascination with him and his receptiveness to their stories.&#10;&#10;The speaker justifies their mental state by observing and interpreting the social dynamics and interactions between Mr. Rochester and the ladies at the gathering. Their suspicions are based on the evidence they have gathered, such as the amount of time Mr. Rochester spends with the ladies and his receptiveness to their stories. The speaker's observations and interpretations of these social cues lead them to form a conclusion about Mr. Rochester's intentions to marry Miss Ingram."/>
<node id=" The first visitor that the lady in question is willing to receive, according to her specifications given through Sam, is a young and single lady."/>
<node id=" The fashionable-looking stranger who arrived in the post-chaise is named Mason, and he comes from Spanish Town in Jamaica. His arrival provoked Miss Ingram because she was expecting Mr. Rochester to return home on his black horse, Mesrour, with his dog Pilot. However, when Mason arrived, there was no sign of Mesrour or Pilot. This led to Miss Ingram's exclamation of surprise and annoyance, as she wondered what had happened to Mr. Rochester's animals. Additionally, Mason's arrival was not the news that Adele had reported, which is why Miss Ingram chided her and glanced angrily at the narrator."/>
<node id=" Mr. Rochester's forgiveness is dependent on whether or not he finds he has committed a &quot;great absurdity&quot; in his interaction with the speaker because he is unsure if he has offended or upset her with his behavior. He may have sensed some distance or change in her demeanor and is trying to gauge if he has done anything wrong.&#10;&#10;The speaker is both wondering and feeling self-congratulatory as they request to retire because they have successfully uncovered Mr. Rochester's plans to marry Miss Ingram, and they are satisfied with their own observational skills and ability to interpret social cues. At the same time, they are also feeling a mix of emotions, including confusion and uncertainty about their own feelings towards Mr. Rochester and their relationship with him, which is why they are wondering about their reaction to his behavior."/>
<node id=" The primary challenge for the narrator, Jane Eyre, in regard to Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram is the disparity between her own feelings for Mr. Rochester and the reality of his impending marriage to Miss Ingram. Jane is deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, but she recognizes that Miss Ingram is the more likely candidate for marriage due to her social status and connections. However, Jane does not experience the same intense emotions of jealousy or resentment towards Miss Ingram that she might have under different circumstances. This is because Jane perceives Miss Ingram as lacking in originality, insincerity, and limited intellect, and therefore views her as an unworthy object of jealousy. Jane believes that Miss Ingram is not good or genuine, and that she cannot charm Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Consequently, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrative suggests that Mr. Rochester is marrying Miss Ingram primarily for reasons of interest and connections, rather than out of love. This further diminishes the romantic nature of their relationship in Jane's eyes. While Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram do share a strong attraction and connection, their behavior during the charade performance suggests a flirtatious and romantic dynamic, rather than a deep emotional bond or love. Mr. Rochester is aware of Miss Ingram's superficiality and lack of originality, and yet still plans to marry her, suggesting that he values her social status and connections more than her personality or character.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane's challenge is not only to come to terms with her own feelings of love and jealousy, but also to recognize the limitations and superficiality of Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram. Jane's emotional response is shaped by her own moral and intellectual values, which lead her to view Miss Ingram as an unworthy object of jealousy, and Mr. Rochester's relationship with her as lacking in depth and genuine affection."/>
<edge source=" Mary Ingram, Amy, and Louisa Eshton required permission from Miss Ingram to visit the library because she was the one who had initially gone to see the fortune-teller and they were afraid to go alone.

The use of phrases like &quot;taking delight in their task of communicating&quot; and &quot;willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him&quot; indicate that Mr. Rochester finds pleasure and satisfaction in the company of this person. Although the text does not explicitly confirm the gipsy's insinuations, the strength of Mr. Rochester's reaction when he hears of a stranger's arrival suggests that he is expecting someone of importance. This could potentially be the individual to whom the gipsy is referring.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the lively tales of matrimony might have contributed to Mr. Rochester's attentiveness, there are stronger indications of a deeper emotional connection with the storyteller.">

She is shown to be more concerned with appearances and social status than genuine emotions or relationships. The narrator, Jane Eyre, finds it difficult to describe her pain as jealousy because she believes that Miss Ingram is not a worthy object of such a feeling. Jane feels that Miss Ingram is not good, not genuine, and not capable of charming Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Therefore, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy.">

The use of phrases like &quot;taking delight in their task of communicating&quot; and &quot;willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him&quot; indicate that Mr. Rochester finds pleasure and satisfaction in the company of this person.

In the narrative provided, Jane Eyre, the protagonist, has learned to love Mr. Rochester, and she cannot stop doing so even when he ignores her and showers his attentions on another woman, Miss Ingram. This is because the feeling of love is not solely based on reciprocation or attention; it is also influenced by the emotional connection, respect, and admiration that Jane has for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not dependent on his careless and prideful courtship of Miss Ingram. Instead, Jane recognizes the superficiality of their relationship and believes that she could have succeeded in winning his heart if she had approached him differently. However, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not based on manipulation or strategy; it is grounded in her genuine appreciation for his personality and their intellectual equality.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Mr. Rochester is ignoring Jane and paying attention to someone else, she cannot stop loving him because her feelings are based on a deeper connection that goes beyond social conventions and external displays of affection.">

While Mr. Rochester may experience physical discomfort, the gipsy is suggesting that he also has the potential for deeper emotional fulfillment if he chooses to pursue it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the gipsy's observations and interpretations are based on her ability to read people's emotions and motivations through their gestures, looks, and behavior. While her interpretations may not be entirely accurate, they suggest that she sees Mr. Rochester as a complex and multifaceted individual who has the power to create his own happiness if he chooses to do so.">

Jane feels that Miss Ingram is not good, not genuine, and not capable of charming Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Therefore, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy." target=" The primary challenge for the narrator, Jane Eyre, in regard to Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram is the disparity between her own feelings for Mr. Rochester and the reality of his impending marriage to Miss Ingram. Jane is deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, but she recognizes that Miss Ingram is the more likely candidate for marriage due to her social status and connections. However, Jane does not experience the same intense emotions of jealousy or resentment towards Miss Ingram that she might have under different circumstances. This is because Jane perceives Miss Ingram as lacking in originality, insincerity, and limited intellect, and therefore views her as an unworthy object of jealousy. Jane believes that Miss Ingram is not good or genuine, and that she cannot charm Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Consequently, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrative suggests that Mr. Rochester is marrying Miss Ingram primarily for reasons of interest and connections, rather than out of love. This further diminishes the romantic nature of their relationship in Jane's eyes. While Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram do share a strong attraction and connection, their behavior during the charade performance suggests a flirtatious and romantic dynamic, rather than a deep emotional bond or love. Mr. Rochester is aware of Miss Ingram's superficiality and lack of originality, and yet still plans to marry her, suggesting that he values her social status and connections more than her personality or character.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane's challenge is not only to come to terms with her own feelings of love and jealousy, but also to recognize the limitations and superficiality of Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram. Jane's emotional response is shaped by her own moral and intellectual values, which lead her to view Miss Ingram as an unworthy object of jealousy, and Mr. Rochester's relationship with her as lacking in depth and genuine affection.">

In the narrative provided, Jane Eyre, the protagonist, has learned to love Mr. Rochester, and she cannot stop doing so even when he ignores her and showers his attentions on another woman, Miss Ingram. This is because the feeling of love is not solely based on reciprocation or attention; it is also influenced by the emotional connection, respect, and admiration that Jane has for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not dependent on his careless and prideful courtship of Miss Ingram. Instead, Jane recognizes the superficiality of their relationship and believes that she could have succeeded in winning his heart if she had approached him differently. However, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not based on manipulation or strategy; it is grounded in her genuine appreciation for his personality and their intellectual equality.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Mr. Rochester is ignoring Jane and paying attention to someone else, she cannot stop loving him because her feelings are based on a deeper connection that goes beyond social conventions and external displays of affection.">

They were so frightened that they ran across the hall and sunk breathlessly into the chairs provided by the gentlemen. Despite the gentlemen's petitions, the ladies did not reveal the specifics of what the fortune-teller had whispered in their ears.&#10;&#10;The community's perception of Jane's abilities as a fortune-teller is not explicitly stated in the narrative. However, it is mentioned that the fortune-teller (who is revealed to be Mr. Rochester in disguise) seemed to know a lot of personal details about Miss Ingram and the others, which made them believe that she was not an ordinary person but possibly a witch or someone with supernatural abilities. This caused their fear and nervous reactions. When the tall, fashionable-looking man named Mason arrives, he assumes that Mr. Rochester is not at home because he is with his new wife, Miss Ingram, indicating that their marriage is a widely known fact.">

While the specific details of the charade are not provided, the text suggests that Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram were deeply engaged in their own private conversation, rather than paying close attention to the performance. Their behavior indicates a strong attraction and connection between them, with Miss Ingram often leaning in towards Mr. Rochester and whispering in his ear, and Mr. Rochester responding in kind. These actions suggest a flirtatious and romantic dynamic between the two characters, further emphasized by Miss Ingram's playful suggestion that she would have liked Mr. Rochester as a &quot;gallant gentleman-highwayman&quot; or an &quot;Italian bandit.&quot; Overall, the nature of their interaction during the charade performance suggests a strong mutual attraction and a possible future marriage.">

Jane is deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, but she recognizes that Miss Ingram is the more likely candidate for marriage due to her social status and connections. However, Jane does not experience the same intense emotions of jealousy or resentment towards Miss Ingram that she might have under different circumstances. This is because Jane perceives Miss Ingram as lacking in originality, insincerity, and limited intellect, and therefore views her as an unworthy object of jealousy. Jane believes that Miss Ingram is not good or genuine, and that she cannot charm Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Consequently, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrative suggests that Mr. Rochester is marrying Miss Ingram primarily for reasons of interest and connections, rather than out of love. This further diminishes the romantic nature of their relationship in Jane's eyes. While Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram do share a strong attraction and connection, their behavior during the charade performance suggests a flirtatious and romantic dynamic, rather than a deep emotional bond or love. Mr. Rochester is aware of Miss Ingram's superficiality and lack of originality, and yet still plans to marry her, suggesting that he values her social status and connections more than her personality or character.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane's challenge is not only to come to terms with her own feelings of love and jealousy, but also to recognize the limitations and superficiality of Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram. Jane's emotional response is shaped by her own moral and intellectual values, which lead her to view Miss Ingram as an unworthy object of jealousy, and Mr. Rochester's relationship with her as lacking in depth and genuine affection.">

<edge source=" Based on the observations and conversations in the room, the stranger, named Mason, is described as a &quot;beautiful man&quot; with a sleek and meek appearance, while Mr. Rochester is described as a fierce and rough-coated falcon or a keen-eyed dog, his guardian. This creates a stark contrast between the two men, with Mason appearing more refined and elegant, and Mr Rochester appearing more intense and powerful. Additionally, the way each man is associated with animals - Mason with a sleek gander and Mr. Rochester with a fierce falcon and a rough-coated dog - further highlights their differences. The guests also note that Mr. Rochester has been the center of attention and the recipient of many smiles from the ladies, indicating his popularity and charm. In contrast, there is no mention of the stranger receiving similar attention, suggesting that he is less engaging or less well-known to the guests." target=" The gipsy's observations about Mr. Rochester's happiness being &quot;carefully laid&quot; aside for him and depending on his own actions to &quot;stretch out his hand, and take it up&quot; are based on her interpretations of his facial expressions and behavior. The gipsy seems to have a keen sense of observation and a belief that people's true feelings and emotions can be read through their gestures, looks, and eyes.&#10;&#10;When the gipsy observes Mr. Rochester's eyes, she notes that they &quot;shine like dew&quot; and are &quot;soft and full of feeling,&quot; indicating a susceptible and emotional nature. She also interprets his &quot;unconscious lassitude&quot; and &quot;melancholy resulting from loneliness&quot; as signs of his inner longing and dissatisfaction with his current situation.&#10;&#10;The gipsy's belief that Mr. Rochester's happiness depends on his own actions suggests that she sees him as having the power to choose his own path and create his own happiness, rather than being passive and waiting for it to come to him. This interpretation is consistent with the gipsy's earlier statement that she likes to observe people and study their gestures and looks, as if she is trying to understand their true motivations and desires.&#10;&#10;The physical discomfort that Mr. Rochester feels from kneeling too close to the fire is separate from the happiness that the gipsy is referring to. While Mr. Rochester may experience physical discomfort, the gipsy is suggesting that he also has the potential for deeper emotional fulfillment if he chooses to pursue it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the gipsy's observations and interpretations are based on her ability to read people's emotions and motivations through their gestures, looks, and behavior. While her interpretations may not be entirely accurate, they suggest that she sees Mr. Rochester as a complex and multifaceted individual who has the power to create his own happiness if he chooses to do so.">

<edge source=" It is natural to find it difficult to stop loving someone once you have developed feelings for them, even if they are ignoring you or paying attention to someone else. In the narrative provided, Jane Eyre, the protagonist, has learned to love Mr. Rochester, and she cannot stop doing so even when he ignores her and showers his attentions on another woman, Miss Ingram. This is because the feeling of love is not solely based on reciprocation or attention; it is also influenced by the emotional connection, respect, and admiration that Jane has for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not dependent on his careless and prideful courtship of Miss Ingram. Instead, Jane recognizes the superficiality of their relationship and believes that she could have succeeded in winning his heart if she had approached him differently. However, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester is not based on manipulation or strategy; it is grounded in her genuine appreciation for his personality and their intellectual equality.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Mr. Rochester is ignoring Jane and paying attention to someone else, she cannot stop loving him because her feelings are based on a deeper connection that goes beyond social conventions and external displays of affection." target=" The gipsy's observations about Mr. Rochester's happiness being &quot;carefully laid&quot; aside for him and depending on his own actions to &quot;stretch out his hand, and take it up&quot; are based on her interpretations of his facial expressions and behavior. The gipsy seems to have a keen sense of observation and a belief that people's true feelings and emotions can be read through their gestures, looks, and eyes.&#10;&#10;When the gipsy observes Mr. Rochester's eyes, she notes that they &quot;shine like dew&quot; and are &quot;soft and full of feeling,&quot; indicating a susceptible and emotional nature. She also interprets his &quot;unconscious lassitude&quot; and &quot;melancholy resulting from loneliness&quot; as signs of his inner longing and dissatisfaction with his current situation.&#10;&#10;The gipsy's belief that Mr. Rochester's happiness depends on his own actions suggests that she sees him as having the power to choose his own path and create his own happiness, rather than being passive and waiting for it to come to him. This interpretation is consistent with the gipsy's earlier statement that she likes to observe people and study their gestures and looks, as if she is trying to understand their true motivations and desires.&#10;&#10;The physical discomfort that Mr. Rochester feels from kneeling too close to the fire is separate from the happiness that the gipsy is referring to. While Mr. Rochester may experience physical discomfort, the gipsy is suggesting that he also has the potential for deeper emotional fulfillment if he chooses to pursue it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the gipsy's observations and interpretations are based on her ability to read people's emotions and motivations through their gestures, looks, and behavior. While her interpretations may not be entirely accurate, they suggest that she sees Mr. Rochester as a complex and multifaceted individual who has the power to create his own happiness if he chooses to do so.">

Mr. Rochester is aware of Miss Ingram's superficiality and lack of originality, and yet still plans to marry her, suggesting that he values her social status and connections more than her personality or character.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane's challenge is not only to come to terms with her own feelings of love and jealousy, but also to recognize the limitations and superficiality of Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram. Jane's emotional response is shaped by her own moral and intellectual values, which lead her to view Miss Ingram as an unworthy object of jealousy, and Mr. Rochester's relationship with her as lacking in depth and genuine affection.">

Additionally, Mason's arrival was not the news that Adele had reported, which is why Miss Ingram chided her and glanced angrily at the narrator." target=" The primary challenge for the narrator, Jane Eyre, in regard to Mr. Rochester's relationship with Miss Ingram is the disparity between her own feelings for Mr. Rochester and the reality of his impending marriage to Miss Ingram. Jane is deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, but she recognizes that Miss Ingram is the more likely candidate for marriage due to her social status and connections. However, Jane does not experience the same intense emotions of jealousy or resentment towards Miss Ingram that she might have under different circumstances. This is because Jane perceives Miss Ingram as lacking in originality, insincerity, and limited intellect, and therefore views her as an unworthy object of jealousy. Jane believes that Miss Ingram is not good or genuine, and that she cannot charm Mr. Rochester in a meaningful way. Consequently, Jane's emotional response to the situation is more complex than simple jealousy.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrative suggests that Mr. Rochester is marrying Miss Ingram primarily for reasons of interest and connections, rather than out of love. This further diminishes the romantic nature of their relationship in Jane's eyes. While Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram do share a strong attraction and connection, their behavior during the charade performance suggests a flirtatious and romantic dynamic, rather than a deep emotional bond or love.

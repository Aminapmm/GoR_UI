    <node id="Tess, the newcomer at the dairy, learns that only a few of the dairymaids sleep in the dairy-house, while most of them go to their homes. She doesn't see the superior milker who had commented on her story during supper and decides not to ask any questions about him. Later, she arranges her place in the bed-chamber, a large room over the milk-house where three other indoor milkmaids, including one who is more wakeful than Tess, also sleep. This wakeful girl informs Tess that Mr. Angel Clare, the dairyman's pupil who plays the harp and is a pa'son's son, is learning farming in all its branches and doesn't pay much attention to the girls.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide information on whether Tess learns more about the superior milker on her first evening at the dairy." />
    <node id="Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the&#10;newcomer, &quot;How pretty she is!&quot; with something of real generosity and&#10;admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify&#10;the assertion--which, strictly speaking, they might have done,&#10;prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in&#10;Tess.  When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled&#10;indoors, where Mrs Crick, the dairyman's wife--who was too&#10;respectable to go out milking herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in&#10;warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints--was giving an eye&#10;to the leads and things.&#10;&#10;Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house&#10;besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes.  She saw&#10;nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on&#10;the story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the&#10;evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber.&#10;It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the&#10;" />
    <node id=" ground.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out&#10;of the dairy-house with the arrival of the cows from the meads; the&#10;maids walking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but to keep&#10;their shoes above the mulch of the barton.  Each girl sat down on&#10;her three-legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting&#10;against the cow, and looked musingly along the animal's flank at Tess&#10;as she approached.  The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down,&#10;resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not&#10;observe her.&#10;&#10;One of these was a sturdy middle-aged man--whose long white &quot;pinner&quot;&#10;was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and&#10;whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect--the&#10;master-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as&#10;a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the&#10;seventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church,&#10;being so marked as to" />

They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather&#10;older than herself.  By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell&#10;asleep immediately.&#10;&#10;But one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful&#10;than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various&#10;particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered.  The&#10;girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess's drowsy&#10;mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they&#10;floated.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr Angel Clare--he that is learning milking, and that plays&#10;the harp--never says much to us.  He is a pa'son's son, and is&#10;too much taken up wi' his own thoughts to notice girls.  He is&#10;the dairyman's pupil--learning farming in all its branches.  He&#10;has learnt sheep-farming at another place" />
    <node id=", this task was thrust most frequently&#10;upon her.  No sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed,&#10;than she left her room and ran to the dairyman's door; then up the&#10;ladder to Angel's, calling him in a loud whisper; then woke her&#10;fellow-milkmaids.  By the time that Tess was dressed Clare was&#10;downstairs and out in the humid air.  The remaining maids and the&#10;dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow, and did&#10;not appear till a quarter of an hour later.&#10;&#10;The gray half-tones of daybreak are not the gray half-tones of the&#10;day's close, though the degree of their shade may be the same.  In&#10;the twilight of the morning, light seems active, darkness passive;&#10;in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and&#10;crescent, and the light which is the drowsy reverse.&#10;&#10;Being so often--possibly not always by chance--the first two persons&#10;to get up at the dairy-house, they seemed to themselves the first&#10;persons up of all the world.

The sole effect of her presence upon the placid&#10;valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron, which,&#10;after descending to the ground not far from her path, stood with neck&#10;erect, looking at her.&#10;&#10;Suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and&#10;repeated call--&quot;Waow! waow! waow!&quot;&#10;&#10;From the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by&#10;contagion, accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog.  It was&#10;not the expression of the valley's consciousness that beautiful Tess&#10;had arrived, but the ordinary announcement of milking-time--half-past&#10;four o'clock, when the dairymen set about getting in the cows.&#10;&#10;The red and white herd nearest at hand, which had been phlegmatically&#10;waiting for the call, now trooped towards the steading in the&#10;background, their great bags of milk swinging under them as they&#10;walked.  Tess followed slowly in their rear, and entered the barton&#10;by the open gate through which" />

I knowed the man well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes; I have no doubt of it,&quot; said the person behind the dun cow.&#10;&#10;Tess's attention was thus attracted to the dairyman's interlocutor,&#10;of whom she could see but the merest patch, owing to his burying his&#10;head so persistently in the flank of the milcher.  She could not&#10;understand why he should be addressed as &quot;sir&quot; even by the dairyman&#10;himself.  But no explanation was discernible; he remained under the&#10;cow long enough to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation&#10;now and then, as if he could not get on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle,&quot; said the dairyman.  &quot;'Tis&#10;knack, not strength, that does it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So I find,&quot; said the other, standing up at last and stretching his&#10;arms.  &quot;I think I have finished her, however, though she made my&#10;fingers ache.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess could then see him at full length.

    <node id="The repeated calls that echoed throughout the valley at half-past four o'clock are not a conscious response to Tess's arrival, but rather the ordinary announcement of milking-time. This is when the dairymen set about getting in the cows. Tess responds to this call by following the red and white herd nearest to hand, which had been waiting for the call, towards the steading in the background. This marks the beginning of her daily routine as a milkmaid at the dairy farm." />
    <node id="&#10;thing aimed at out of doors.  Tess and Clare unconsciously studied&#10;each other, ever balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently&#10;keeping out of it.  All the while they were converging, under an&#10;irresistible law, as surely as two streams in one vale.&#10;&#10;Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now,&#10;possibly never would be so happy again.  She was, for one thing,&#10;physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings.  The&#10;sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of&#10;its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil.  Moreover she, and&#10;Clare also, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection&#10;and love; where no profundities have been reached; no reflections&#10;have set in, awkwardly inquiring, &quot;Whither does this new current tend&#10;to carry me?  What does it mean to my future?  How does it stand&#10;towards my past?&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet--a rosy,&#10;warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of&#10;persistence in his" />

Thence she started on foot, basket in hand,&#10;to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the&#10;low-lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was&#10;the aim and end of her day's pilgrimage.&#10;&#10;Tess had never before visited this part of the country, and yet she&#10;felt akin to the landscape.  Not so very far to the left of her she&#10;could discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed&#10;her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere--in&#10;the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors--her useless&#10;ancestors--lay entombed.&#10;&#10;She had no admiration for them now; she almost hated them for the&#10;dance they had led her; not a thing of all that had been theirs did&#10;she retain but the old seal and spoon.  &quot;Pooh--I have as much of&#10;mother as father in me!&quot; she said.  &quot;All my prettiness comes from&#10;her, and she was only a dairymaid.&quot;&#10;&#10;The journey over the" />
    <node id="The speaker, Tess, is worried about revealing her appreciation for the subject's (Mr. Clare's) consideration because she feels that she may have given him the wrong impression. She had spoken to him with earnestness about her desire to remain in her secluded environment, and, due to her emotional state, she fears that he might misconstrue her words as having some sort of significance regarding his presence. This worry on Tess's part suggests that their relationship may not be as straightforward as it initially seems. While they have an obvious connection and mutual respect for each other, Tess is cautious about revealing too much of herself to Mr. Clare, hinting at the complexities and vulnerabilities she brings to their relationship due to her past experiences." />

I HOPE I shall!  But I don't KNOW.&quot;&#10;&#10;She was angry with herself afterwards, thinking that he, unaware of&#10;her grave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken her&#10;meaning.  She had spoken so earnestly to him, as if his presence&#10;were somehow a factor in her wish.  Her misgiving was such that at&#10;dusk, when the milking was over, she walked in the garden alone, to&#10;continue her regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of&#10;his considerateness.&#10;&#10;It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in&#10;such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects&#10;seemed endowed with two or three senses," />

And the river says,--'Why do ye trouble me with your&#10;looks?'  And you seem to see numbers of to-morrows just all in a&#10;line, the first of them the biggest and clearest, the others getting&#10;smaller and smaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem&#10;very fierce and cruel and as if they said, 'I'm coming!

She was&#10;expressing in her own native phrases--assisted a little by her Sixth&#10;Standard training--feelings which might almost have been called those&#10;of the age--the ache of modernism.  The perception arrested him less&#10;when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in&#10;great part but the latest fashion in definition--a more accurate&#10;expression, by words in _logy_ and _ism_, of sensations which men and&#10;women have vaguely grasped for centuries.&#10;&#10;Still, it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so&#10;young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic.&#10;Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that&#10;experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration.  Tess's&#10;passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest.&#10;&#10;Tess, on her part, could not understand why a man of clerical family&#10;and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a&#10;mishap to be alive.

When he was gone she stood&#10;awhile, thoughtfully peeling the last bud; and then, awakening&#10;from her reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility&#10;impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with&#10;herself for her _niaiserie_, and with a quickening warmth in her&#10;heart of hearts.&#10;&#10;How stupid he must think her!  In an access of hunger for his good&#10;opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to&#10;forget, so unpleasant had been its issues--the identity of her family&#10;with that of the knightly d'Urbervilles.  Barren attribute as it was,&#10;disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps&#10;Mr Clare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect&#10;her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and&#10;ladies if he knew that those Purbeck-marble and alabaster people in&#10;Kingsbere Church really represented her own lineal forefathers; that&#10;she was no spurious d'Urberville, compounded of money and ambition&#10;like those at" />

Tess Durbeyfield has been hired by Dairyman Crick as a milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy, and she is able to milk cows for him. She is initially worried that Dairyman Crick may recognize her from their family's past but realizes that he does not remember them.&#10;3. Tess's ability to milk cows is important because it is the skill that allows her to find employment at the dairy and support herself and her family financially. The fact that she can do this job well, despite some initial difficulties, highlights her strength and determination as a character." />

A reply, in the shape of &quot;Why?&quot;&#10;came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had&#10;been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto&#10;perceived.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes; there's nothing like a fiddle,&quot; said the dairyman. &quot;Though&#10;I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows--at least&#10;that's my experience.  Once there was an old aged man over at&#10;Mellstock--William Dewy by name--one of the family that used to do&#10;a good deal of business as tranters over there--Jonathan, do ye&#10;mind?--I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in&#10;a manner of speaking.  Well, this man was a coming home along from a&#10;wedding, where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight&#10;night, and for shortness' sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a&#10;field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass.  The bull seed&#10;William, and took after him, horns aground," />

She&#10;saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile&#10;face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man's&#10;shapely moustache and beard--the latter of the palest straw colour&#10;where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther&#10;from its root.  Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark&#10;velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white&#10;shirt.  Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what&#10;he was.  He might with equal probability have been an eccentric&#10;landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman.  That he was but a novice at&#10;dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent&#10;upon the milking of one cow.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the&#10;newcomer, &quot;How pretty she is!&quot; with something of real generosity and&#10;" />
    <node id=" the right direction.  Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or&#10;at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the&#10;business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would&#10;probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he&#10;valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.&#10;&#10;So we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a&#10;student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which&#10;he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.&#10;&#10;His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the&#10;dairy-house.  It could only be reached by a ladder from the&#10;cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived&#10;and selected it as his retreat.  Here Clare had plenty of space, and&#10;could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the&#10;household had gone to rest.  A portion was divided off at one end by&#10;a curtain, behind which was his bed, the outer part being furnished&#10;as a homely sitting-room.&#10;&#10;" />

Out of the whole ninety-five there were eight in&#10;particular--Dumpling, Fancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty,&#10;Tidy, and Loud--who, though the teats of one or two were as hard as&#10;carrots, gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them&#10;a mere touch of the fingers.  Knowing, however, the dairyman's wish,&#10;she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they&#10;came, excepting the very hard yielders which she could not yet&#10;manage.&#10;&#10;But she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly&#10;chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter, till she&#10;felt that their order could not be the result of accident.  The&#10;dairyman's pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of&#10;late, and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes, as she&#10;rested against the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr Clare, you have ranged the cows!&quot; she said, blushing; and in" />
    <node id="The young girl's vague grasp of advanced ideas is impressive, interesting, and pathetic because she is still very young, yet she is able to contemplate deep philosophical concepts. This is unexpected and unusual in someone of her age, which makes it noteworthy. On the other hand, the man from a clerical family views life as a 'mishap' because he subscribes to an untenable redemptive theology, meaning that he believes in a strict religious doctrine that doesn't allow for a more liberated interpretation of faith. This perspective is perplexing because, despite his education and family background, he fails to see life as a valuable and enriching experience, instead of something to be endured. The contrast lies in the fact that while Tess is able to find meaning and think critically about her existence at a young age, the man is unable to do so, being constrained by his religious beliefs." />

Why--it is a system of philosophy.  There is no more&#10;moral, or even religious, work published.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--moral enough; I don't deny that.

    <node id=" day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies&#10;at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller's,&#10;directed to the Reverend James Clare.  The Vicar having opened it and&#10;found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up&#10;from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his&#10;arm.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why has this been sent to my house?&quot; he asked peremptorily, holding&#10;up the volume.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was ordered, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.&quot;&#10;&#10;The shopkeeper looked into his order-book.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, it has been misdirected, sir,&quot; he said.  &quot;It was ordered by Mr&#10;Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck.  He went home pale and&#10;dejected, and called Angel into his study.&#10;&#10;&quot;Look into this book, my boy,&quot; he said.  &quot;What do you know about it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I ordered it,&quot; said Angel simply.&#10;&#10;&quot;What for?&quot;&#10;" />

This feeling of familiarity, combined with her natural beauty, leads the speaker to prefer observing Tess over the other milkmaids when he wants to gaze at &quot;contiguous womankind.&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Clare continued to observe her.  She soon finished her eating, and&#10;having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her, began to trace&#10;imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the&#10;constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!&quot; he&#10;said to himself.&#10;&#10;And then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar,&#10;something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,&#10;before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray.  He&#10;concluded that he had beheld her before; where he could not tell.  A&#10;casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been,&#10;and he was not greatly curious about it.

    <node id="The relationship between Tess and Angel Clare is deepening, although both are initially puzzled by each other's character. They have not yet fully understood each other's secrets and are cautious about prying into each other's history.

However, she is physically and mentally suited to her new surroundings on the farm, finding happiness in her new life.&#10;&#10;Angel Clare, on the other hand, observes Tess's dejection and is intrigued by her. He finds himself attracted to her while being preoccupied with his own thoughts. The text suggests that both Tess and Angel are gradually revealing themselves to each other through their daily interactions, with Tess trying to lead a repressed life but unaware of the strength of her vitality.&#10;&#10;In summary, the deepening relationship between Tess and Angel Clare is characterized by mutual fascination and gradual self-revelation.

    <node id="Clare's listlessness is being caused by his absorption in an imaginary tune that he can hear in his head.

One day, however, when he had been conning one of his&#10;music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in&#10;his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled&#10;to the hearth.

Between&#10;Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their&#10;munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while to the side&#10;was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular&#10;leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk.

But he soon preferred to read human nature by&#10;taking his meals downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the&#10;dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed&#10;a lively assembly; for though but few milking hands slept in the&#10;house, several joined the family at meals.  The longer Clare resided&#10;here the less objection had he to his company, and the more did he&#10;like to share quarters with them in common.&#10;&#10;Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their&#10;companionship.

    <node id="1. Based on the passage, Tess's primary responsibility as one of the first to get up at the dairy-house is to wake up the other milkmaids, Angel Clare (the dairyman's pupil), and the dairyman himself. She does this by going to the dairyman's door, climbing the ladder to Angel's room to call him, and then waking her fellow milkmaids.&#10;2. Tess feels somewhat privileged or special in being one of the first persons up at the dairy-house, as she and the other early riser seem to themselves as the first people up in the world. This experience offers her a unique perspective during the gray half-tones of daybreak, where light appears active and darkness passive.&#10;3. The passage doesn't explicitly mention Tess's feelings about waking up early; however, it can be inferred that she accepts this responsibility as part of her role at the dairy farm and understands its importance for the daily milking routine. This task further emphasizes her strong work ethic and commitment to supporting herself and her family financially." />
    <node id="The disappearance of the typical &quot;Hodge&quot; resulted in a greater appreciation for individuality and diversity among men because, as Pascal noted, people with more spirit find that there are more original men. In contrast, common people do not perceive differences among men. When Clare moved to the countryside and lived among rural workers, he initially saw them as strange and undignified. However, after spending time with them, he began to see their individuality and appreciate the variety among them. This shift in perception led him to enjoy outdoor life and his company more. The absence of the stereotypical &quot;Hodge&quot; allowed Clare to see the unique qualities of each person, leading to a greater appreciation for diversity and individuality." />

Sitting down as a&#10;level member of the dairyman's household seemed at the outset an&#10;undignified proceeding.  The ideas, the modes, the surroundings,&#10;appeared retrogressive and unmeaning.  But with living on there,&#10;day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect&#10;in the spectacle.  Without any objective change whatever, variety&#10;had taken the place of monotonousness.  His host and his host's&#10;household, his men and his maids, as they became intimately known to&#10;Clare, began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process.&#10;The thought of Pascal's was brought home to him: &quot;_A mesure qu'on a&#10;plus d'esprit, on trouve qu'il y a plus d'hommes originaux.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Tess does not wish to learn any specific subject as per Mr. Clare's suggestion, but she expresses a more general desire for knowledge and understanding. However, she also reveals that she sees limited value in learning about her own past or her place in history, as it only makes her feel sad and constrained by the notion that she is just one of many similar individuals throughout time. Instead, Tess wants to focus on the present and future, rather than dwell on the past. She seems to be looking for a sense of purpose and identity beyond what has already been written or determined for her.&#10;&#10;A direct quote from Tess that supports this interpretation is: &quot;Sometimes I feel I don't want to know anything more about it than I know already... Because what's the use of learning that I am one of a long row only--finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just like me, and to know that I shall only act her part; making me sad, that's all.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess wishes to learn about life, purpose, and identity, but she finds limited value in learning about her past or comparing herself to historical figures.

    <node id="1. The sturdy middle-aged dairyman that Tess is searching for is Dairyman Crick, the owner of Talbothays Dairy.&#10;2. What sets him apart from the other milkers in terms of his appearance is that his &quot;pinner&quot; (a long white apron) is somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and his jacket underneath has a presentable marketing aspect. His double character as a working milker and butter maker during six days and as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church on the seventh day also distinguishes him from the other milkers." />
    <node id="Tess is reluctant to pursue further knowledge or study, especially in history, because she sees limited value in learning about her own past or comparing herself to historical figures.

    <node id="1. Tess, the new milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy, learns that only a few of the dairymaids sleep in the dairy-house, while most of them go to their homes. She doesn't see the superior milker who had commented on her story during supper and decides not to ask any questions about him.&#10;2. Tess arranges her place in the bed-chamber, a large room over the milk-house where three other indoor milkmaids also sleep. She is informed by one of the girls that Mr. Angel Clare, the dairyman's pupil who plays the harp and is a pa'son's son, is learning farming in all its branches and doesn't pay much attention to the girls.&#10;3. The passage does not provide information on whether Tess learns more about the superior milker on her first evening at the dairy. It also does not mention if Tess sees the superior milker during her initial days at the dairy." />
    <node id="Angel Clare's aversion to modern town life developed from his early association with country solitudes, which bred in him an innate preference for rural environments. This tendency was further strengthened by his negative experience of being carried away by a woman in London and nearly being entrapped. These experiences led him to reject the impracticability of spiritual calling and consider farming as a viable career path instead. &#10;&#10;Moreover, the text suggests that Angel's decision to become a Colonial farmer was also influenced by his acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a Colonial farmer. This exposure to a successful Colonial farmer sparked Angel's curiosity and led him to view farming as a potential career path in the Colonies or America, where he could acquire practical skills in various farming processes. Overall, Angel's decision to become a Colonial farmer was motivated by his aversion to modern town life, negative experiences in urban environments, and exposure to successful farming practices." />

As a balance to these austerities, when he went to&#10;live in London to see what the world was like, and with a view to&#10;practising a profession or business there, he was carried off his&#10;head, and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself, though&#10;luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience.&#10;&#10;Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an&#10;unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,&#10;and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by&#10;following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual&#10;one.

This lady had somewhat&#10;unexpectedly brought him three sons, so that between Angel, the&#10;youngest, and his father the Vicar there seemed to be almost a&#10;missing generation.  Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of&#10;his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree,&#10;though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have&#10;done full justice to an academical training.&#10;&#10;Some two or three years before Angel's appearance at the Marlott&#10;dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies&#10;at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller's,&#10;directed" />

This theology may not allow for a more liberated interpretation of faith, which is why Angel refuses to take Orders while the Church &quot;refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.&quot; The Vicar's traditional view of Cambridge as a stepping-stone to Orders and his deep grief over Angel's decision suggest that he values adherence to this religious doctrine over his son's individual desires and convictions." />

    <node id="George Eliot, through her character Adam Bede (referred to as &quot;Clare&quot; in the provided narrative), illustrates the idea that increased perception and understanding often come with time and familiarity. At first, Clare sees the rural workers as strange and undignified, but as he spends more time with them, he begins to appreciate their individuality and variety. This shift in perception mirrors Pascal's thought that people with greater spirit can recognize more original men, while common people often fail to perceive differences among men.&#10;&#10;Eliot emphasizes the importance of spending time and making an effort to understand others, as our initial impressions may not accurately represent the true nature of individuals. By engaging with the villagers and observing them closely, Clare gains insight into their unique qualities and comes to enjoy their company more. This transformation in his perception highlights the value of looking beyond superficial appearances and giving people the opportunity to reveal their individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, George Eliot's character Adam Bede (Clare) gains insights about originality and perception through his experiences with the villagers. He learns that spending time with others and making an effort to understand them can lead to a greater appreciation for their unique qualities and disposition. This lesson reinforces Pascal's idea that those with more refined minds are better able to recognize similarities in character among people from various walks of life." />

The speaker's admiration for Tess is based on her natural beauty and the feeling of closeness he experiences in her presence.&#10;3.

Instead, William used his fiddle to play a trick on a bull that was chasing him while returning home from a wedding. He started playing the 'Tivity Hymn (probably referring to a traditional English hymn about the Nativity of Jesus) in hopes that the bull might think it is Christmas Eve and kneel down in reverence, giving William time to escape. The trick worked, and William was able to jump over a hedge and escape before the bull could get back on its feet." />
    <node id="1. Tess's action that surprises Dairyman Crick is when she requests to try milking the hard-teated cow, Priddy Squire, instead of an easier one. He is surprised because it is not the usual choice for a new milkmaid and shows that Tess is determined and willing to take on a challenge.&#10;&#10;2. Dairyman Crick expresses slight contempt for Tess's choice of drink (new milk) because, as a dairy owner and someone who works closely with cows, he is aware that fresh milk from a cow contains bacteria and enzymes that can cause it to spoil quickly. Therefore, new milk is not suitable for drinking straight away, unlike the pasteurized or boiled milk that Tess is used to. The &quot;rot&quot; he mentions refers to the souring or curdling of the milk due to these natural processes." />

The conviction bred serenity, her pulse&#10;slowed, and she was able to look about her.&#10;&#10;The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the&#10;men operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier&#10;natures.  It was a large dairy.

    <node id="1. Angel Clare was described as an admirable and poetic man who, unfortunately, found himself in the Valley of Humiliation. This state of being was mainly because he had not yet discovered his purpose or aim in life, despite having early promises of greatness that could have been realized with academic training.&#10;2. He was decidedly bookish, musical, and thinking, but these qualities did not impress him much when it came to the &quot;good old family&quot; or any mundane calling. Instead, he had an unconquerable aversion to modern town life and sought solace in country solitudes.&#10;3. When he moved to London to see what the world was like and practice a profession or business, he nearly fell prey to a woman older than him but luckily escaped without much harm.&#10;4. After wasting many valuable years, Angel decided to pursue farming as a career, inspired by a friend who had found success in Colonial farming. He entered the ranks of agriculturists and breeders with an objective to acquire practical skills in various processes of farming, which he could use either for tenure of a home-farm or in the Colonies.&#10;5. In summary, Angel Clare willingly descended into the Valley of Humiliation to learn how to become a successful dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder of cattle because he wanted to acquire practical skills that could help him make a living. His love for books, music, and thinking did not provide him with any material future, so he decided to pursue a career in farming despite having no previous experience." />
    <node id="1. The Valley of the Great Dairies represents a significant turning point in Tess's life, as it is where she will begin her new job as a milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy. Eustacia Vye, who is referenced in the passage, is a separate character from Tess and is not present in this scene.&#10;2. The Valley of the Great Dairies is described as having larger enclosures, more extensive farmsteads, and tribes of cattle instead of families, suggesting a greater scale of dairy production than the Vale of Little Dairies that Tess was familiar with. The valley also has a clear, bracing, ethereal air compared to the intensely blue atmosphere and heavy soils of Blackmoor Vale.&#10;3. The passage does not provide direct comparison between the two vales in terms of their significance for Tess, but it can be inferred that the Valley of the Great Dairies represents a new beginning for her, a place where she can escape from her past and start anew. The valley is also portrayed as a more positive and uplifting environment than Blackmoor Vale, with its clear air and bracing atmosphere reflecting Tess's renewed energy and optimism." />

It was&#10;two hours, owing to sundry wrong turnings, ere she found herself&#10;on a summit commanding the long-sought-for vale, the Valley of the&#10;Great Dairies, the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness,&#10;and were produced more profusely, if less delicately, than at her&#10;home--the verdant plain so well watered by the river Var or Froom.&#10;&#10;It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies,&#10;Blackmoor Vale, which, save during her disastrous sojourn at&#10;Trantridge, she had exclusively known till now.  The world was drawn&#10;to a larger pattern here.  The enclosures numbered fifty acres&#10;instead of ten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of&#10;cattle formed tribes hereabout; there only families.  These myriads" />
    <node id="instead of ten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of&#10;cattle formed tribes hereabout; there only families.  These myriads&#10;of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west&#10;outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before. The green&#10;lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot&#10;or Sallaert with burghers.  The ripe hue of the red and dun kine&#10;absorbed the evening sunlight, which the white-coated animals&#10;returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling, even at the distant&#10;elevation on which she stood.&#10;&#10;The bird's-eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly&#10;beautiful, perhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it&#10;was more cheering.  It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the&#10;rival vale, and its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear,&#10;bracing, ethereal.  The river itself, which nourished the grass&#10;and cows of these renowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in&#10;Blackmoor.  Those were slow, silent, often turbid" />

The secret of Blackmoor was best discovered&#10;from the heights around; to read aright the valley before her it was&#10;necessary to descend into its midst.  When Tess had accomplished this&#10;feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which&#10;stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach.&#10;&#10;The river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles&#10;to the vale all this horizontal land; and now, exhausted, aged, and&#10;attenuated, lay serpentining along through the midst of its former&#10;spoils.&#10;&#10;Not quite sure of her direction, Tess stood still upon the hemmed&#10;expanse of verdant flatness, like a fly on a billiard-table of&#10;indefinite length, and of no more consequence to the surroundings&#10;than that fly.

    <node id="1. What circumstances led to Tess, a young girl, having thoughts and feelings that might be considered &quot;modernist&quot; or &quot;advanced?&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess's exposure to advanced ideas at a young age can be attributed to her innate intelligence and the intellectual environment she was introduced to through her Sixth Standard training. These factors allowed her to grasp complex philosophical concepts beyond her years, giving her a fresh perspective on life and her place in it. The narrative suggests that &quot;advanced ideas&quot; are fashionable interpretations of long-existing human sensations and experiences, which Tess has been able to articulate due to her unique qualities and circumstances.&#10;&#10;2. Why does the observer find it both impressive, interesting, and pathetic, yet not guessing the cause?&#10;&#10;The speaker finds Tess's contemplation of deep philosophical concepts both impressive and interesting because it is unusual and unexpected for someone so young. However, he also considers her situation pathetic as she is still very young and may not fully comprehend or cope with such complex ideas appropriately. The observer does not guess the cause of Tess's advanced thoughts because he is unaware of her personal struggles and experiences that have led her to develop these perspectives on life, which has been a &quot;passing corporeal blight&quot; but a &quot;mental harvest&quot; for Tess." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, the man that Tess has realized she has met before is Mr. Clare, who is also known as Angel Clare. Their first encounter occurred when Tess and her family were staying at a roadside inn during their journey to Talbothays Dairy. At that time, Tess was still working as a dairymaid and had not yet revealed her past troubles to Mr. Clare.&#10;&#10;Tess's relationship with Mr. Clare is one of growing connection and mutual respect, but she is cautious about revealing too much of herself due to her past experiences. She sees Angel as an intelligence and often feels dejected due to the distance she perceives between their mental standpoints. However, she finds happiness in her new life on the farm and appreciates Angel's consideration.&#10;&#10;If Mr. Clare recognizes Tess and remembers their previous encounter, it could potentially lead to the revelation of her past troubles, which she has been trying to keep hidden from him. This could impact their relationship negatively, as Tess is worried that Mr. Clare might misconstrue her words as having some sort of significance regarding his presence. The text suggests that both characters are gradually revealing themselves to each other through their daily interactions, with Tess trying to lead a repressed life but unaware of the strength of her vitality. Therefore, it remains to be seen how Mr. Clare's recognition of Tess will affect their deepening relationship and whether it will lead to further complications or a better understanding between them." />
    <node id="The disappearance of the stereotypical &quot;Hodge&quot; allowed individuals to be seen as unique beings with diverse qualities, rather than being reduced to an undignified caricature. This change in perception led to a greater appreciation for individuality among men because, as Pascal noted, people with more spirit find that there are more original men.&#10;&#10;As the common stereotype of &quot;Hodge&quot; faded away, Clare began to see the rural workers as distinct individuals, each with their own personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Through this process, he realized that his initial perceptions of them were misguided and incomplete. The absence of the stereotypical figure allowed for a more nuanced understanding and appreciation of the people around him.&#10;&#10;Additionally, as Clare started to recognize the unique qualities of those living and working in the countryside, he developed a newfound appreciation for outdoor life. By connecting with the villagers on a deeper level, he discovered the pleasures of the natural world beyond its impact on his own career prospects. This shift in perspective transformed his experience of rural life, making him more receptive to its charms and intricacies.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the disappearance of the typical &quot;Hodge&quot; allowed for a greater appreciation for individuality because it facilitated a more nuanced understanding of people's unique qualities. As common stereotypes faded away, Clare was able to engage with rural workers as distinct individuals, leading to an increased enjoyment of outdoor life and its varied inhabitants." />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, Clare realized that his initial perceptions of conventional farm-folk, which he had derived from the stereotypical figure of &quot;Hodge&quot; in the newspaper-press, were misguided. When he began to form relationships with the dairyman, his wife, and their employees during his stay at the dairy farm, he discovered that they were unique individuals with diverse personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, rather than undignified caricatures. This shift in perspective led him to appreciate individuality more and discover the pleasures of rural life beyond its impact on his career prospects. The absence of the stereotypical figure of &quot;Hodge&quot; allowed for a more nuanced understanding and appreciation of the people around him, leading to a greater enjoyment of outdoor life and its varied inhabitants." />
    <node id="1. Tasks and Experiences: As a milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy, Tess's primary responsibility is to milk cows. She begins her day by waking up early to rouse the other milkmaids, Angel Clare, and Dairyman Crick. Tess also responds to the half-past four o'clock call that echoes throughout the valley, signaling milking-time. She follows the red and white herd towards the steading, where she performs her daily milking routine.&#10;2. Environment and People's Impact on Tess: The environment and people around Tess at the dairy farm shape her appearance and demeanor in various ways. The speaker's admiration for Tess is based on her natural beauty and the familiarity he feels when observing her, comparing her to a &quot;daughter of Nature.&quot; This portrayal suggests that the rural setting and Tess's role as a milkmaid contribute to her pure and virginal image.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Tess's interactions with the dairy workers, such as Dairyman Crick and Angel Clare, also influence her experiences at the dairy. Although she initially worries that Dairyman Crick might recognize her family's past, she soon realizes he does not remember them. This interaction may help Tess feel more at ease in her new environment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, working alongside other milkmaids and Angel Clare allows Tess to form connections with the people around her. These relationships can impact her demeanor, as shared experiences and camaraderie among workers often lead to a sense of belonging and increased confidence. Over time, this could contribute to Tess's personal growth and development." />

His double character as a working milker and butter maker during six days and as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church on the seventh day also distinguishes him from the other milkers.">

They have not yet fully understood each other's secrets and are cautious about prying into each other's history. Tess sees Angel as an intelligence and compares herself to him, often feeling dejected due to the distance between their mental standpoints. However, she is physically and mentally suited to her new surroundings on the farm, finding happiness in her new life.&#10;&#10;Angel Clare, on the other hand, observes Tess's dejection and is intrigued by her. He finds himself attracted to her while being preoccupied with his own thoughts. The text suggests that both Tess and Angel are gradually revealing themselves to each other through their daily interactions, with Tess trying to lead a repressed life but unaware of the strength of her vitality.&#10;&#10;In summary, the deepening relationship between Tess and Angel Clare is characterized by mutual fascination and gradual self-revelation. The impact on Tess is her growing appreciation for the farm life and the possibility of a deeper connection with Angel. For Angel, his interaction with Tess offers new insights into human nature, which contrasts with his bookish upbringing, contributing to his intrigue towards her.">

This marks the beginning of her daily routine as a milkmaid at the dairy farm." target="1. Tess's action that surprises Dairyman Crick is when she requests to try milking the hard-teated cow, Priddy Squire, instead of an easier one. He is surprised because it is not the usual choice for a new milkmaid and shows that Tess is determined and willing to take on a challenge.&#10;&#10;2. Dairyman Crick expresses slight contempt for Tess's choice of drink (new milk) because, as a dairy owner and someone who works closely with cows, he is aware that fresh milk from a cow contains bacteria and enzymes that can cause it to spoil quickly. Therefore, new milk is not suitable for drinking straight away, unlike the pasteurized or boiled milk that Tess is used to. The &quot;rot&quot; he mentions refers to the souring or curdling of the milk due to these natural processes.">

The Valley of the Great Dairies represents a significant turning point in Tess's life, as it is where she will begin her new job as a milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy. Eustacia Vye, who is referenced in the passage, is a separate character from Tess and is not present in this scene.&#10;2. The Valley of the Great Dairies is described as having larger enclosures, more extensive farmsteads, and tribes of cattle instead of families, suggesting a greater scale of dairy production than the Vale of Little Dairies that Tess was familiar with. The valley also has a clear, bracing, ethereal air compared to the intensely blue atmosphere and heavy soils of Blackmoor Vale.&#10;3. The passage does not provide direct comparison between the two vales in terms of their significance for Tess, but it can be inferred that the Valley of the Great Dairies represents a new beginning for her, a place where she can escape from her past and start anew. The valley is also portrayed as a more positive and uplifting environment than Blackmoor Vale, with its clear air and bracing atmosphere reflecting Tess's renewed energy and optimism.">

She begins her day by waking up early to rouse the other milkmaids, Angel Clare, and Dairyman Crick. Tess also responds to the half-past four o'clock call that echoes throughout the valley, signaling milking-time. She follows the red and white herd towards the steading, where she performs her daily milking routine.&#10;2. Environment and People's Impact on Tess: The environment and people around Tess at the dairy farm shape her appearance and demeanor in various ways. The speaker's admiration for Tess is based on her natural beauty and the familiarity he feels when observing her, comparing her to a &quot;daughter of Nature.&quot; This portrayal suggests that the rural setting and Tess's role as a milkmaid contribute to her pure and virginal image.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Tess's interactions with the dairy workers, such as Dairyman Crick and Angel Clare, also influence her experiences at the dairy. Although she initially worries that Dairyman Crick might recognize her family's past, she soon realizes he does not remember them. This interaction may help Tess feel more at ease in her new environment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, working alongside other milkmaids and Angel Clare allows Tess to form connections with the people around her. These relationships can impact her demeanor, as shared experiences and camaraderie among workers often lead to a sense of belonging and increased confidence. Over time, this could contribute to Tess's personal growth and development.">

Their first encounter occurred when Tess and her family were staying at a roadside inn during their journey to Talbothays Dairy. At that time, Tess was still working as a dairymaid and had not yet revealed her past troubles to Mr. Clare.&#10;&#10;Tess's relationship with Mr. Clare is one of growing connection and mutual respect, but she is cautious about revealing too much of herself due to her past experiences. She sees Angel as an intelligence and often feels dejected due to the distance she perceives between their mental standpoints. However, she finds happiness in her new life on the farm and appreciates Angel's consideration.&#10;&#10;If Mr. Clare recognizes Tess and remembers their previous encounter, it could potentially lead to the revelation of her past troubles, which she has been trying to keep hidden from him. This could impact their relationship negatively, as Tess is worried that Mr. Clare might misconstrue her words as having some sort of significance regarding his presence. The text suggests that both characters are gradually revealing themselves to each other through their daily interactions, with Tess trying to lead a repressed life but unaware of the strength of her vitality. Therefore, it remains to be seen how Mr. Clare's recognition of Tess will affect their deepening relationship and whether it will lead to further complications or a better understanding between them.">

This perspective is perplexing because, despite his education and family background, he fails to see life as a valuable and enriching experience, instead of something to be endured. The contrast lies in the fact that while Tess is able to find meaning and think critically about her existence at a young age, the man is unable to do so, being constrained by his religious beliefs.">

This shift in perception mirrors Pascal's thought that people with greater spirit can recognize more original men, while common people often fail to perceive differences among men.&#10;&#10;Eliot emphasizes the importance of spending time and making an effort to understand others, as our initial impressions may not accurately represent the true nature of individuals.

Based on the passage, Tess's primary responsibility as one of the first to get up at the dairy-house is to wake up the other milkmaids, Angel Clare (the dairyman's pupil), and the dairyman himself. She does this by going to the dairyman's door, climbing the ladder to Angel's room to call him, and then waking her fellow milkmaids.&#10;2.

This task further emphasizes her strong work ethic and commitment to supporting herself and her family financially.">

Therefore, new milk is not suitable for drinking straight away, unlike the pasteurized or boiled milk that Tess is used to.

Tasks and Experiences: As a milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy, Tess's primary responsibility is to milk cows. She begins her day by waking up early to rouse the other milkmaids, Angel Clare, and Dairyman Crick. Tess also responds to the half-past four o'clock call that echoes throughout the valley, signaling milking-time. She follows the red and white herd towards the steading, where she performs her daily milking routine.&#10;2. Environment and People's Impact on Tess: The environment and people around Tess at the dairy farm shape her appearance and demeanor in various ways.

Although she initially worries that Dairyman Crick might recognize her family's past, she soon realizes he does not remember them. This interaction may help Tess feel more at ease in her new environment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, working alongside other milkmaids and Angel Clare allows Tess to form connections with the people around her. These relationships can impact her demeanor, as shared experiences and camaraderie among workers often lead to a sense of belonging and increased confidence. Over time, this could contribute to Tess's personal growth and development.">

She&#10;saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile&#10;face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man's&#10;shapely moustache and beard--the latter of the palest straw colour&#10;where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther&#10;from its root.  Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark&#10;velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white&#10;shirt.  Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what&#10;he was.  He might with equal probability have been an eccentric&#10;landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman.  That he was but a novice at&#10;dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent&#10;upon the milking of one cow.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the&#10;newcomer, &quot;How pretty she is!&quot; with something of real generosity and&#10;" target="1. Angel Clare was described as an admirable and poetic man who, unfortunately, found himself in the Valley of Humiliation. This state of being was mainly because he had not yet discovered his purpose or aim in life, despite having early promises of greatness that could have been realized with academic training.&#10;2. He was decidedly bookish, musical, and thinking, but these qualities did not impress him much when it came to the &quot;good old family&quot; or any mundane calling. Instead, he had an unconquerable aversion to modern town life and sought solace in country solitudes.&#10;3. When he moved to London to see what the world was like and practice a profession or business, he nearly fell prey to a woman older than him but luckily escaped without much harm.&#10;4. After wasting many valuable years, Angel decided to pursue farming as a career, inspired by a friend who had found success in Colonial farming. He entered the ranks of agriculturists and breeders with an objective to acquire practical skills in various processes of farming, which he could use either for tenure of a home-farm or in the Colonies.&#10;5. In summary, Angel Clare willingly descended into the Valley of Humiliation to learn how to become a successful dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder of cattle because he wanted to acquire practical skills that could help him make a living. His love for books, music, and thinking did not provide him with any material future, so he decided to pursue a career in farming despite having no previous experience.">

Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or&#10;at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the&#10;business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would&#10;probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he&#10;valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.&#10;&#10;So we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a&#10;student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which&#10;he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's.&#10;&#10;His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the&#10;dairy-house.  It could only be reached by a ladder from the&#10;cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived&#10;and selected it as his retreat.  Here Clare had plenty of space, and&#10;could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the&#10;household had gone to rest.  A portion was divided off at one end by&#10;a curtain, behind which was his bed, the outer part being furnished&#10;as a homely sitting-room.&#10;&#10;" target="Based on the passage provided, Clare realized that his initial perceptions of conventional farm-folk, which he had derived from the stereotypical figure of &quot;Hodge&quot; in the newspaper-press, were misguided. When he began to form relationships with the dairyman, his wife, and their employees during his stay at the dairy farm, he discovered that they were unique individuals with diverse personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, rather than undignified caricatures. This shift in perspective led him to appreciate individuality more and discover the pleasures of rural life beyond its impact on his career prospects. The absence of the stereotypical figure of &quot;Hodge&quot; allowed for a more nuanced understanding and appreciation of the people around him, leading to a greater enjoyment of outdoor life and its varied inhabitants.">

She feels that such knowledge only makes her feel sad and constrained by the notion that she is just one of many similar individuals throughout time. Tess wants to focus on the present and future rather than dwell on the past, as she seeks a sense of purpose and identity beyond what has already been written or determined for her. This attitude towards learning highlights Tess's desire for individuality and self-determination, which is challenged by the weight of history and its tendency to repeat itself.">

These factors allowed her to grasp complex philosophical concepts beyond her years, giving her a fresh perspective on life and her place in it.

Their first encounter occurred when Tess and her family were staying at a roadside inn during their journey to Talbothays Dairy. At that time, Tess was still working as a dairymaid and had not yet revealed her past troubles to Mr. Clare.&#10;&#10;Tess's relationship with Mr. Clare is one of growing connection and mutual respect, but she is cautious about revealing too much of herself due to her past experiences. She sees Angel as an intelligence and often feels dejected due to the distance she perceives between their mental standpoints. However, she finds happiness in her new life on the farm and appreciates Angel's consideration.&#10;&#10;If Mr. Clare recognizes Tess and remembers their previous encounter, it could potentially lead to the revelation of her past troubles, which she has been trying to keep hidden from him. This could impact their relationship negatively, as Tess is worried that Mr. Clare might misconstrue her words as having some sort of significance regarding his presence. The text suggests that both characters are gradually revealing themselves to each other through their daily interactions, with Tess trying to lead a repressed life but unaware of the strength of her vitality. Therefore, it remains to be seen how Mr. Clare's recognition of Tess will affect their deepening relationship and whether it will lead to further complications or a better understanding between them.">

This interaction may help Tess feel more at ease in her new environment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, working alongside other milkmaids and Angel Clare allows Tess to form connections with the people around her. These relationships can impact her demeanor, as shared experiences and camaraderie among workers often lead to a sense of belonging and increased confidence.

When he began to form relationships with the dairyman, his wife, and their employees during his stay at the dairy farm, he discovered that they were unique individuals with diverse personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, rather than undignified caricatures. This shift in perspective led him to appreciate individuality more and discover the pleasures of rural life beyond its impact on his career prospects.

At first, Clare sees the rural workers as strange and undignified, but as he spends more time with them, he begins to appreciate their individuality and variety. This shift in perception mirrors Pascal's thought that people with greater spirit can recognize more original men, while common people often fail to perceive differences among men.&#10;&#10;Eliot emphasizes the importance of spending time and making an effort to understand others, as our initial impressions may not accurately represent the true nature of individuals.

This transformation in his perception highlights the value of looking beyond superficial appearances and giving people the opportunity to reveal their individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, George Eliot's character Adam Bede (Clare) gains insights about originality and perception through his experiences with the villagers. He learns that spending time with others and making an effort to understand them can lead to a greater appreciation for their unique qualities and disposition.

This shift in perception mirrors Pascal's thought that people with greater spirit can recognize more original men, while common people often fail to perceive differences among men.&#10;&#10;Eliot emphasizes the importance of spending time and making an effort to understand others, as our initial impressions may not accurately represent the true nature of individuals.

His love for books, music, and thinking did not provide him with any material future, so he decided to pursue a career in farming despite having no previous experience.">

She follows the red and white herd towards the steading, where she performs her daily milking routine.&#10;2. Environment and People's Impact on Tess: The environment and people around Tess at the dairy farm shape her appearance and demeanor in various ways. The speaker's admiration for Tess is based on her natural beauty and the familiarity he feels when observing her, comparing her to a &quot;daughter of Nature.&quot; This portrayal suggests that the rural setting and Tess's role as a milkmaid contribute to her pure and virginal image.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Tess's interactions with the dairy workers, such as Dairyman Crick and Angel Clare, also influence her experiences at the dairy. Although she initially worries that Dairyman Crick might recognize her family's past, she soon realizes he does not remember them. This interaction may help Tess feel more at ease in her new environment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, working alongside other milkmaids and Angel Clare allows Tess to form connections with the people around her. These relationships can impact her demeanor, as shared experiences and camaraderie among workers often lead to a sense of belonging and increased confidence.

Their first encounter occurred when Tess and her family were staying at a roadside inn during their journey to Talbothays Dairy. At that time, Tess was still working as a dairymaid and had not yet revealed her past troubles to Mr. Clare.&#10;&#10;Tess's relationship with Mr. Clare is one of growing connection and mutual respect, but she is cautious about revealing too much of herself due to her past experiences. She sees Angel as an intelligence and often feels dejected due to the distance she perceives between their mental standpoints. However, she finds happiness in her new life on the farm and appreciates Angel's consideration.&#10;&#10;If Mr. Clare recognizes Tess and remembers their previous encounter, it could potentially lead to the revelation of her past troubles, which she has been trying to keep hidden from him. This could impact their relationship negatively, as Tess is worried that Mr. Clare might misconstrue her words as having some sort of significance regarding his presence. The text suggests that both characters are gradually revealing themselves to each other through their daily interactions, with Tess trying to lead a repressed life but unaware of the strength of her vitality. Therefore, it remains to be seen how Mr. Clare's recognition of Tess will affect their deepening relationship and whether it will lead to further complications or a better understanding between them.">

Dairyman Crick expresses slight contempt for Tess's choice of drink (new milk) because, as a dairy owner and someone who works closely with cows, he is aware that fresh milk from a cow contains bacteria and enzymes that can cause it to spoil quickly.

Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. The problem is that his remarks don't reflect reality. Tax avoidance is the legal use of tax havens. The five big Bay Street banks benefit from this, as do the big multinationals.

Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ)&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent!

Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. We don't expect the big banks to need these funds. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed," />

We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. In our opinion, that is very important. It will protect the jobs of Canadians and the future of our economy. That's why the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility is very important. That said, we know that it is necessary and important to impose conditions. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. That is why we have attached a number of major conditions to our approach. We will have more details on the subject in the coming days. We established from the outset that we had to impose conditions on executive compensation. That is very important. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees.

We're asking a very simple question here. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: My commitment as Prime Minister and as a government is to support and protect Canadians. That is what we are doing by giving them the support they need through this unprecedented situation. Perhaps other parties don't think it's important to support Canadians. We will keep focused on supporting Canadians.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Dan Albas&#10;Content: That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?&#10;Speaker:" />

Your support during these trying times is much appreciated. The oil and gas industry is under severe strain. Over the past number of years, we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill, Bill C-69, which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry.

    <node id="017 action plan while Coastal GasLink, a single project in the fossil fuel sector, is also receiving $500 million, the question is whether the Natural Resources Minister considers this situation fair and if they will commit to providing the forestry industry with equal liquidity support.&#10;&#10;Based on the transcripts provided, the minister has not explicitly addressed the question of committing to providing the same amount of liquidity for the forestry industry as given to the fossil fuel sector. The government has emphasized their commitment to supporting the oil and gas industry during the COVID-19 crisis, acknowledging its importance in terms of jobs and future lowering of emissions. They have also mentioned taking steps to ensure stability in this sector by working with industry and provinces, introducing liquidity measures for both large cap corporations and small and medium-sized businesses.&#10;&#10;Regarding the forestry industry, the government highlighted their support through the softwood lumber action plan since 2017 and their ongoing efforts to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies, and grows. While there is no explicit commitment to matching the financial support given to the fossil fuel sector, the government acknowledges the importance of the forestry industry and its role in job creation and innovation.&#10;&#10;In summary, considering the information provided in the transcripts, the Natural Resources Minister has not explicitly committed to providing the forestry industry with equal liquidity support as that offered to the fossil fuel sector." />
    <node id=" the forestry industry. Unfortunately, in Canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries, including providing liquidity support. Yesterday's announcement suggests that the $500million being provided by EDC is for a single project: Coastal GasLink. In 2017, under the softwood lumber action plan, EDC's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $500million. Now, EDC is shelling out $500million for just one project, Coastal GasLink, even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $500million when it needed EDC's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs. The industry accounts for 58,000jobs in Quebec and $6billion of Quebec's GDP. As I see it, there is a fundamental inequity. My question is for the natural resources minister. Does he think this situation is fair? Will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

    <node id="1. Delayed Announcement of Help for Seniors: The Liberal government is perceived as undervaluing seniors due to the delay in announcing help for them during the pandemic. Critics like Mrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC) argue that the Liberals treated seniors as an afterthought, given that the announcement came three months into the pandemic. This perceived lack of priority for seniors has contributed to the notion that the government undervalues them.&#10;2. One-Time Payment of up to $500: The second factor contributing to this perception is the one-time payment of up to $500 for eligible seniors, which some consider inadequate. Critics argue that this amount does not sufficiently address the financial challenges faced by seniors during the pandemic. Compounding this issue, critics like Mrs. Stephanie Kusie have pointed out additional expenses and financial burdens on seniors that further exacerbate their struggles.&#10;3. Lack of Commitment to Stronger National Standards: The transcript does not show Minister Patty Hajdu explicitly agreeing to implement strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement, or a shift towards public delivery of care for long-term care homes, which has also fueled the perception that the Liberal government undervalues seniors.&#10;&#10;In summary, the delayed announcement of help for seniors, the perceived inadequacy of the one-time payment, and the lack of commitment to stronger national standards have contributed to the belief that the Liberal government is undervaluing seniors during the pandemic." />

Some that are being run by not-for-profit societies are actually running very well, certainly in my community, but they are facing increased costs that could bankrupt them. As yet, there's no program to help a well-run seniors home that is not experiencing a loss of revenue and has lots of staff working hard. These homes have increased costs for wages and increased costs for PPE and nowhere to look for help. Is there help coming?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Patty Hajdu&#10;Content: I offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe. The member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes, but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things, including costs. We continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through, for example, generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate.

Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. I recognize there is more to do. There is always more to do. We will be there and continue to be there for vulnerable people, including homeless Canadians.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Jenny Kwan&#10;Content: I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals." />

However, they have mentioned taking steps to ensure the stability of the oil and gas sector, including working with industry and provinces, concentrating on workers, and introducing liquidity measures for both large cap corporations and small and medium-sized businesses in the sector.&#10;2. They acknowledge the importance of the oil and gas industry for providing jobs for over 576,000 people, including 11,000 indigenous people, and have mentioned their commitment to support these businesses. Additionally, they highlighted that many of the workers in this sector are needed for lowering emissions and achieving a greener economy, indicating an intention to keep the industry operational while transitioning towards more sustainable practices.&#10;3. The government has introduced liquidity measures specifically targeted at small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry, which make up 85% of jobs in this sector. They have also provided assistance for larger corporations. These measures aim to support workers and ensure the competitiveness of Canada's oil and gas sector.&#10;4. The government is aware of challenges faced by indigenous-owned businesses in accessing financial help, but no specific measures addressing these issues have been mentioned. It is important for the government to review eligibility criteria to ensure that these businesses can receive support during this critical time.&#10;5.

She acknowledged that there is still a lot of work to be done with all parties and encouraged leaders to continue their ongoing conversations with their community. However, she did not explicitly address the call for resignation or indicate that the federal government would change its approach.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on Hon.

    <node id="Based on the transcripts provided, the Canadian government is preparing to take action to address the crisis in seniors' health care, particularly in long-term care homes. Minister Patty Hajdu has expressed her belief that long-term care homes should be held to stronger standards and has begun preliminary conversations with her counterparts on this issue. She also mentioned working with various ministers across the government to think about how to strengthen networks of long-term care or care alternatives.&#10;&#10;However, Minister Hajdu did not explicitly agree to implement strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement, and a shift towards public delivery of care, as suggested by the member from the New Democratic Party (NDP). The NDP also called for addressing the high death rates in private, for-profit facilities compared to public or non-profit homes.&#10;&#10;Minister Hajdu did emphasize that long-term care homes fall under the jurisdiction of provincial and territorial governments, but she is committed to engaging with her colleagues across the country, including experts, to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life, safety, and dignity in their elder years.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there are no specific measures or proposals on the table, the government acknowledges the issue and is open to discussions about potential solutions for improving senior care across Canada." />
    <node id="1. Delayed Announcement of Help for Seniors: The Liberal government is perceived as undervaluing seniors due to the delay in announcing help for them during the pandemic. Critics like Mrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC) argue that the Liberals treated seniors as an afterthought, given that the announcement came three months into the pandemic. This perceived lack of priority for seniors has contributed to the notion that the government undervalues them.&#10;&#10;2. Perception of Inadequate Financial Support: The one-time payment of up to $500 for eligible seniors, along with the GST top-up, is considered inadequate by some critics. They argue that these amounts do not sufficiently address the financial challenges faced by seniors during the pandemic. Compounding this issue, critics like Mrs. Stephanie Kusie have pointed out additional expenses and financial burdens on seniors that further exacerbate their struggles.&#10;&#10;3. Lack of Commitment to Stronger National Standards: The transcript does not show Minister Patty Hajdu explicitly agreeing to implement strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement, or a shift towards public delivery of care for long-term care homes. This has also fueled the perception that the Liberal government undervalues seniors.&#10;&#10;4. Handling of Long-Term Care Homes: The opposition and various stakeholders have criticized the Liberal government for not taking enough action regarding the crisis in long-term care homes, where a large proportion of COVID-19 related deaths have occurred. This has further contributed to the belief that the government is undervaluing seniors during the pandemic.&#10;&#10;In summary, the delayed announcement of help for seniors, the perceived inadequacy of financial support, the lack of commitment to stronger national standards, and the handling of long-term care homes have collectively given the impression that the Liberal government is undervaluing seniors compared to others during the COVID-19 pandemic." />

However, Minister Blair does not explicitly mention the Iver Johnson rifle when discussing the nine models of rifles that were designed for military use and are now banned.

He questioned the group's effectiveness, calling it an &quot;empty shell&quot; and a &quot;post-crisis political pitch.&quot;&#10;2. Simard highlighted that recent government announcements on the natural resources front primarily involve fossil fuels, such as the $1.7 billion investment to clean up orphan wells and Export and Development Canada lending TC Energy $500 million to build its Coastal GasLink pipeline. He questioned how these decisions align with the government's desire to transition to a green economy.&#10;3.

Compounding this issue, critics like Mrs. Stephanie Kusie have pointed out additional expenses and financial burdens on seniors that further exacerbate their struggles.&#10;&#10;3. Lack of Commitment to Stronger National Standards: The transcript does not show Minister Patty Hajdu explicitly agreeing to implement strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement, or a shift towards public delivery of care for long-term care homes.

    <node id="Based on the account of Cain Ball, a young man who has visited Bath, we can gather some information about the city. Bath is known for its hot springs that provide boiling water for the use of its inhabitants. The citizens of Bath seem to have adapted to this peculiarity and drink the hot water instead of more traditional beverages. However, Cain mentions a drawback: God did not provide them with easily available food as well, which he found unusual.&#10;&#10;The city features large glass windows in shops and is surrounded by old wooden trees in the countryside. When Cain visited Bath, the sky was full of rain clouds. The architecture or cityscape of Bath includes 'great' structures, hinting at imposing or grand buildings.&#10;&#10;Cain also observed that the people of Bath have different attire and customs, as he saw Miss Everdene wearing a gold-colored silk gown with black trimming, which could be indicative of fashion preferences in the city. He also mentions encountering a soldier while there.&#10;&#10;Overall, based on Cain Ball's description, Bath appears to be a city with unique natural features and customs, surrounded by countryside, and having imposing buildings and shops with large glass windows. The inhabitants drink hot water from the springs, which is not common in other places, and they have adapted to this condition as part of their daily lives." />

You are sure 'twas she?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, what besides?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Great glass windows to the shops, and great clouds in the sky, full&#10;of rain, and old wooden trees in the country round.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You stun-poll!  What will ye say next?&quot; said Coggan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let en alone,&quot; interposed Joseph Poorgrass.  &quot;The boy's meaning is&#10;that the sky and the earth in the kingdom of Bath is not altogether&#10;different from ours here.  'Tis for our good to gain knowledge of&#10;strange cities, and as such the boy's words should be suffered, so&#10;to speak it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the people of Bath,&quot; continued Cain, &quot;never need to light their&#10;fires except as a luxury, for the water springs up out of the earth&#10;ready boiled for use.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis true as the light,&quot; testified Matthew Moon. &quot;I've heard other&#10;nav" />

You'll&#10;choke yourself some day, that's what you'll do, Cain Ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hok-hok-hok!&quot; replied Cain.  &quot;A crumb of my victuals went the&#10;wrong way--hok-hok!  That's what 'tis, Mister Oak!  And I've been&#10;visiting to Bath because I had a felon on my thumb; yes, and I've&#10;seen--ahok-hok!&quot;&#10;&#10;Directly Cain mentioned Bath, they all threw down their hooks and&#10;forks and drew round him.  Unfortunately the erratic crumb did not&#10;improve his narrative powers, and a supplementary hindrance was that&#10;of a sneeze, jerking from his pocket his rather large watch, which&#10;dangled in front of the young man pendulum-wise.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; he continued, directing his thoughts to Bath and letting his&#10;eyes follow, &quot;I've seed the world at last--yes--and I've seed our&#10;mis'ess--ahok-hok-hok!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bother the" />

God didn't provide&#10;'em with victuals as well as drink, and 'twas a drawback I couldn't&#10;get over at all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, 'tis a curious place, to say the least,&quot; observed Moon; &quot;and&#10;it must be a curious people that live therein.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Everdene and the soldier were walking about together, you say?&quot;&#10;said Gabriel, returning to the group.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, and she wore a beautiful gold-colour silk gown, trimmed with&#10;black" />
    <node id=" to the inmates, and the&#10;voice was Troy's.  This was strange, coming so immediately after&#10;his arrival.  Boldwood, however, hastened up to him.  Troy had what&#10;appeared to be a carpet-bag in his hand--the same that he had brought&#10;with him.  It seemed as if he were going to leave again this very&#10;night.&#10;&#10;Troy turned up the hill and quickened his pace.  Boldwood stepped&#10;forward.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sergeant Troy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--I'm Sergeant Troy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just arrived from up the country, I think?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just arrived from Bath.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am William Boldwood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed.&quot;&#10;&#10;The tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted&#10;to bring Boldwood to the point.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish to speak a word with you,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;What about?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About her who lives just ahead there--and about a woman you have&#10;wronged.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wonder at your impertinence,&quot; said Troy, moving on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now look here,&quot; said Boldwood, standing in front of him, &quot;w" />
    <node id=" of&#10;how the land lies with Bathsheba, 'twould be a mistake to kill me,&#10;would it not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twould be a mistake to kill you,&quot; repeated Boldwood, mechanically,&#10;with a bowed head.&#10;&#10;&quot;Better kill yourself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Far better.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm glad you see it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Troy, make her your wife, and don't act upon what I arranged just&#10;now.  The alternative is dreadful, but take Bathsheba; I give her up!&#10;She must love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as&#10;she has done.  Wretched woman--deluded woman--you are, Bathsheba!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But about Fanny?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba is a woman well to do,&quot; continued Boldwood, in nervous&#10;anxiety, &quot;and, Troy, she will make a good wife; and, indeed, she is&#10;worth your hastening on your marriage with her!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But she has a will--not to say a temper, and I shall be a mere slave&#10;to her.  I could do anything with poor Fanny Robin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Troy,&quot; said Bold" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Coggan explains that they couldn't see the message Bathsheba wrote on the coach-house doors because it was fastened and it would have been difficult for them to check it in the dark without waking the inmates. The message was only visible in the morning light. Therefore, they concluded that she had left without notifying anyone and brought trouble upon her." />
    <node id=".  I could neither wake Maryann nor get into&#10;the house, though I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill.&#10;Fortunately, I could get the key of the coach-house, so I troubled no&#10;one further. Didn't you think it might be me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should we, miss?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps not.  Why, those are never Farmer Boldwood's horses!&#10;Goodness mercy! what have you been doing--bringing trouble upon me in&#10;this way?  What! mustn't a lady move an inch from her door without&#10;being dogged like a thief?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But how was we to know, if you left no account of your doings?&quot;&#10;expostulated Coggan, &quot;and ladies don't drive at these hours, miss,&#10;as a jineral rule of society.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did leave an account--and you would have seen it in the morning.&#10;I wrote in chalk on the coach-house doors that I had come back for&#10;the horse and gig, and driven off; that I could arouse nobody, and&#10;should return soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you'll consider, ma'am, that we couldn't see that till" />
    <node id="his mistress.&#10;&#10;On hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light.&#10;Coggan had, however, caught sight of her in the meanwhile.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, 'tis mistress--I'll take my oath!&quot; he said, amazed.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba it certainly was, and she had by this time done the trick&#10;she could do so well in crises not of love, namely, mask a surprise&#10;by coolness of manner.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Gabriel,&quot; she inquired quietly, &quot;where are you going?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We thought--&quot; began Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am driving to Bath,&quot; she said, taking for her own use the&#10;assurance that Gabriel lacked.  &quot;An important matter made it&#10;necessary for me to give up my visit to Liddy, and go off at once.&#10;What, then, were you following me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We thought the horse was stole.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--what a thing!  How very foolish of you not to know that I had&#10;taken the trap and horse.  I could neither wake Maryann nor get into&#10;the house, though I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill.&#10;Fortunately, I" />
    <node id="&quot;If I am useless I will go,&quot; said Bathsheba, in a flagging cadence.&#10;&quot;But O, if your life should be lost!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not useless; but I would rather not tire you longer.  You&#10;have done well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you better!&quot; she said, gratefully.  &quot;Thank you for your&#10;devotion, a thousand times, Gabriel!  Goodnight--I know you are doing&#10;your very best for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;She diminished in the gloom, and vanished, and he heard the latch&#10;of the gate fall as she passed through.  He worked in a reverie&#10;now, musing upon her story, and upon the contradictoriness of that&#10;feminine heart which had caused her to speak more warmly to him&#10;to-night than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to speak&#10;as warmly as she chose.&#10;&#10;He was disturbed in his meditation by a grating noise from the&#10;coach-house.  It was the vane on the roof turning round, and this&#10;change in the wind was the signal for a disastrous rain.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="oldwood likewise vanished up the road, and Oak shortly afterwards&#10;turned indoors to bed.&#10;&#10;Farmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene's house.  He reached&#10;the front, and approaching the entrance, saw a light in the parlour.&#10;The blind was not drawn down, and inside the room was Bathsheba,&#10;looking over some papers or letters.  Her back was towards Boldwood.&#10;He went to the door, knocked, and waited with tense muscles and an&#10;aching brow.&#10;&#10;Boldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with&#10;Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury.  Silent and alone, he had remained&#10;in moody meditation on woman's ways, deeming as essentials of the&#10;whole sex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever&#10;closely beheld.  By degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded&#10;him, and this was the reason of his sally to-night.  He had come to&#10;apologize and beg forgiveness of Bathsheba with something like a&#10;sense of shame at his violence, having but just now learnt that she&#10;had returned--only from a visit to Liddy, as he" />
    <node id=" go straight to her parlour, and make any&#10;arrangement you please to secure my compliance with your wishes.  But&#10;she must know nothing of this cash business.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; said Boldwood, hastily.  &quot;Here is the sum, and&#10;if you'll come to my house we'll write out the agreement for the&#10;remainder, and the terms also.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;First we'll call upon her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But why?  Come with me to-night, and go with me to-morrow to the&#10;surrogate's.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But she must be consulted; at any rate informed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well; go on.&quot;&#10;&#10;They went up the hill to Bathsheba's house.  When they stood at the&#10;entrance, Troy said, &quot;Wait here a moment.&quot;  Opening the door, he&#10;glided inside, leaving the door ajar.&#10;&#10;Boldwood waited.  In two minutes a light appeared in the passage.&#10;Boldwood then saw that the chain had been fastened across the door.&#10;Troy appeared inside, carrying a bedroom candlestick.&#10;&#10;&quot;What, did you think I should break in" />
    <node id="In the narrative, the junior shepherd, referred to as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;the boy,&quot; witnessed Bathsheba and Sergeant Troy walking together closely, with their arms in a crook-like position, which he interpreted as them courting. This sight caused him to cough and struggle for breath, interrupting his narrative." />
    <node id=" the world at last--yes--and I've seed our&#10;mis'ess--ahok-hok-hok!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bother the boy!&quot; said Gabriel. &quot;Something is always going the wrong&#10;way down your throat, so that you can't tell what's necessary to be&#10;told.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ahok! there!  Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have just fleed into my&#10;stomach and brought the cough on again!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, that's just it.  Your mouth is always open, you young rascal!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat, pore boy!&quot;&#10;said Matthew Moon.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, at Bath you saw--&quot; prompted Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;I saw our mistress,&quot; continued the junior shepherd, &quot;and a sojer,&#10;walking along.  And bymeby they got closer and closer, and then they&#10;went arm-in-crook, like courting complete--hok-hok! like courting&#10;complete--hok!--courting complete--&quot;  Losing the thread of his&#10;narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of breath, their&#10;inform" />
    <node id=" her, and resting on the top round of the ladder.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, mistress,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose you thought that when I galloped away to Bath that night&#10;it was on purpose to be married?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did at last--not at first,&quot; he answered, somewhat surprised at the&#10;abruptness with which this new subject was broached.&#10;&#10;&quot;And others thought so, too?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you blamed me for it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--a little.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought so.  Now, I care a little for your good opinion, and&#10;I want to explain something--I have longed to do it ever since I&#10;returned, and you looked so gravely at me.  For if I were to die--and&#10;I may die soon--it would be dreadful that you should always think&#10;mistakenly of me.  Now, listen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel ceased his rustling.&#10;&#10;&quot;I went to Bath that night in the full intention of breaking off my&#10;engagement to Mr. Troy.  It was owing to circumstances which occurred&#10;after I got there that--that we were married.  Now," />
    <node id=" Gabriel listlessly staring at the&#10;ground.  His mind sped into the future, and saw there enacted in&#10;years of leisure the scenes of repentance that would ensue from this&#10;work of haste.  That they were married he had instantly decided.  Why&#10;had it been so mysteriously managed?  It had become known that she&#10;had had a fearful journey to Bath, owing to her miscalculating the&#10;distance: that the horse had broken down, and that she had been more&#10;than two days getting there.  It was not Bathsheba's way to do things&#10;furtively.  With all her faults, she was candour itself.  Could she&#10;have been entrapped?  The union was not only an unutterable grief to&#10;him: it amazed him, notwithstanding that he had passed the preceding&#10;week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of Troy's meeting&#10;her away from home.  Her quiet return with Liddy had to some extent&#10;dispersed the dread.  Just as that imperceptible motion which appears&#10;like stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stillness&#10;itself, so had his hope undistinguishable from despair differed from&#10;despair indeed.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="ambourine aforesaid--no mean instrument in the hands of a performer&#10;who understands the proper convulsions, spasms, St. Vitus's dances,&#10;and fearful frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their&#10;highest perfection.&#10;&#10;The immortal tune ended, a fine DD rolling forth from the bass-viol&#10;with the sonorousness of a cannonade, and Gabriel delayed his entry&#10;no longer.  He avoided Bathsheba, and got as near as possible&#10;to the platform, where Sergeant Troy was now seated, drinking&#10;brandy-and-water, though the others drank without exception cider and&#10;ale. Gabriel could not easily thrust himself within speaking distance&#10;of the sergeant, and he sent a message, asking him to come down for a&#10;moment.  The sergeant said he could not attend.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you tell him, then,&quot; said Gabriel, &quot;that I only stepped ath'art&#10;to say that a heavy rain is sure to fall soon, and that something&#10;should be done to protect the ricks?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Troy says it will not rain,&quot; returned the messenger, &quot;and he&#10;cannot stop to talk to you about such fidgets.&quot;&#10;&#10;In juxtap" />
    <node id="The one who had stolen the horse and turned out to be the driver of the gig when Gabriel and the others went through the turnpike-house was Bathsheba, Gabriel's mistress. This is revealed when the turnpike-man opens the door of the turnpike-house and the keeper comes out half-dressed, with a candle in his hand." />
    <node id="&#10;against a shady background of foliage, five white bars were visible,&#10;crossing their route a little way ahead.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hush--we are almost close!&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;Amble on upon the grass,&quot; said Coggan.&#10;&#10;The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in&#10;front of them.  The silence of this lonely time was pierced by an&#10;exclamation from that quarter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hoy-a-hoy!  Gate!&quot;&#10;&#10;It appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not&#10;noticed, for on their close approach the door of the turnpike-house&#10;opened, and the keeper came out half-dressed, with a candle in his&#10;hand.  The rays illumined the whole group.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep the gate close!&quot; shouted Gabriel.  &quot;He has stolen the horse!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who?&quot; said the turnpike-man.&#10;&#10;Gabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and saw a woman--Bathsheba,&#10;his mistress.&#10;&#10;On hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light.&#10;Coggan had, however, caught sight of her in" />
    <node id=" bread!&quot; groaned Joseph Poorgrass.&#10;&#10;Then the reapers' hooks were flourished again, and the old sounds&#10;went on.  Gabriel, without making any pretence of being lively, did&#10;nothing to show that he was particularly dull.  However, Coggan knew&#10;pretty nearly how the land lay, and when they were in a nook together&#10;he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't take on about her, Gabriel.  What difference does it make&#10;whose sweetheart she is, since she can't be yours?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the very thing I say to myself,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;HOME AGAIN--A TRICKSTER&#10;&#10;&#10;That same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over Coggan's&#10;garden-gate, taking an up-and-down survey before retiring to rest.&#10;&#10;A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of&#10;the lane.  From it spread the tones of two women talking.  The tones&#10;were natural and not at all suppressed. Oak instantly knew the voices&#10;to be those of Bathsheba and Liddy.&#10;&#10;The carriage came opposite and passed by.  It was Miss Everdene's&#10;gig, and" />
    <node id="Whew-w-w!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lame,&quot; said Oak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  Dainty is lamed; the near-foot-afore,&quot; said Coggan slowly,&#10;staring still at the footprints.&#10;&#10;&quot;We'll push on,&quot; said Gabriel, remounting his humid steed.&#10;&#10;Although the road along its greater part had been as good as any&#10;turnpike-road in the country, it was nominally only a byway.  The&#10;last turning had brought them into the high road leading to Bath.&#10;Coggan recollected himself.&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall have him now!&quot; he exclaimed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sherton Turnpike.  The keeper of that gate is the sleepiest man&#10;between here and London--Dan Randall, that's his name--knowed en for&#10;years, when he was at Casterbridge gate. Between the lameness and the&#10;gate 'tis a done job.&quot;&#10;&#10;They now advanced with extreme caution.  Nothing was said until,&#10;against a shady background of foliage, five white bars were visible,&#10;crossing their route a little way ahead.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hush--we are" />
    <node id=",&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue--keeping a body awake&#10;like this!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It isn't Laban--'tis Gabriel Oak.  I want the key of the granary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Gabriel!  What in the name of fortune did you pretend to be Laban&#10;for?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I didn't.  I thought you meant--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes you did!  What do you want here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The key of the granary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Take it then.  'Tis on the nail.  People coming disturbing women at&#10;this time of night ought--&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the conclusion of the&#10;tirade.  Ten minutes later his lonely figure might have been seen&#10;dragging four large water-proof coverings across the yard, and soon&#10;two of these heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug--two cloths&#10;to each.  Two hundred pounds were secured.  Three wheat-stacks&#10;remained open, and there were no more cloths.  Oak looked under the&#10;staddles and found a fork.  He mounted the third" />
    <node id=" bridle, Oak and&#10;Coggan extemporized the former by passing the rope in each case&#10;through the animal's mouth and looping it on the other side.  Oak&#10;vaulted astride, and Coggan clambered up by aid of the bank, when&#10;they ascended to the gate and galloped off in the direction taken by&#10;Bathsheba's horse and the robber.  Whose vehicle the horse had been&#10;harnessed to was a matter of some uncertainty.&#10;&#10;Weatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four minutes.  They&#10;scanned the shady green patch by the roadside.  The gipsies were&#10;gone.&#10;&#10;&quot;The villains!&quot; said Gabriel.  &quot;Which way have they gone, I wonder?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Straight on, as sure as God made little apples,&quot; said Jan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well; we are better mounted, and must overtake em&quot;, said Oak.&#10;&quot;Now on at full speed!&quot;&#10;&#10;No sound of the rider in their van could now be discovered.

    <node id="In this scene, it is revealed that Troy has been waiting for Bathsheba when she says, &quot;Frank, dearest, is that you?&quot; This is confirmed by Boldwood's reaction, as he recognizes the voice and says, &quot;O God!&quot;" />

Now sit still there, and hold my carpet bag for me, and&#10;mark what you hear.&quot;&#10;&#10;The light footstep came closer, halting occasionally, as if the&#10;walker listened for a sound.

I listened and heard his wheels entering the village, but&#10;it was some time ago, and I had almost given you up, Frank.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was sure to come,&quot; said Frank.  &quot;You knew I should, did you not?&quot;&#10;&#10;" />

Troy continued--&#10;&#10;&quot;Fifty pounds to marry Fanny.  Good.  Twenty-one pounds not to marry&#10;Fanny, but Bathsheba.  Good.  Finale: already Bathsheba's husband.&#10;Now, Boldwood, yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends&#10;interference between a man and his wife.  And another word.  Bad as I&#10;am, I am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any&#10;woman a matter of huckster and sale.  Fanny has long ago left me.  I&#10;don't know where she is.  I have searched everywhere.  Another word&#10;yet.  You say you love Bathsheba; yet on the merest apparent evidence&#10;you instantly believe in her dishonour.  A fig for such love!

    <node id="In the narrative, Sergeant Troy dismisses Gabriel Oak's warning about the impending heavy rain and the need to protect the ricks. When Oak asks a messenger to tell Troy about the situation, his message is met with disregard. Troy says it will not rain and that he cannot stop to talk to Oak about such &quot;fidgets.&quot; This shows Troy's lack of concern for the potential damage to the crops and his unwillingness to listen to Oak's advice, highlighting his carefree and reckless personality." />

The wheat&#10;when threshed would average about thirty quarters to each stack; the&#10;barley, at least forty.  Their value to Bathsheba, and indeed to&#10;anybody, Oak mentally estimated by the following simple&#10;calculation:--&#10;&#10;&#10;      5 x 30 = 150 quarters = 500 L.&#10;      3 x 40 = 120 quarters = 250 L.&#10;                            -------&#10;                    Total . . 750 L.&#10;&#10;&#10;Seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form that" />

In approaching the door, his&#10;toe kicked something which felt and sounded soft, leathery, and&#10;distended, like a boxing-glove.  It was a large toad humbly&#10;travelling across the path.  Oak took it up, thinking it might be&#10;better to kill the creature to save it from pain; but finding it&#10;uninjured, he placed it again among the grass.  He knew what this&#10;direct message from the Great Mother meant.  And soon came another.&#10;&#10;When he struck a light indoors there appeared upon the table a thin&#10;glistening streak, as if a brush of varnish had been lightly dragged&#10;across it.

Even after contemplating a future filled with misery and considering the possibility that Troy might forget her or fall in love with someone else, Bathsheba's feelings for him are so strong that she cannot resist the urge to see him one more time.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Cain Ball describes Bath as a city with unique natural features, specifically its hot springs that provide boiling water for use by the inhabitants. Instead of traditional beverages, the people of Bath drink this hot water, which seems unusual to outsiders. The city has large glass windows in shops and is surrounded by countryside with old wooden trees. The architecture in Bath includes imposing or grand buildings.&#10;&#10;Cain also mentions that the attire of the people in Bath is different, as evidenced by Miss Everdene wearing a gold-colored silk gown with black trimming. He encountered a soldier during his visit as well. Despite the distinctive characteristics of Bath, Cain notes a drawback: God did not provide them with easily available food, which he found to be a significant issue.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bath is a city with unique natural features, including hot springs and a rural countryside. The buildings are grand, and the people have distinct attire and customs. However, there is no readily available food source, making it difficult for inhabitants to obtain sustenance." />
    <node id="In the scene described, there are several unusual phenomena occurring in the sky. First, skeletons made of blue fire appear, shaped from what appears to be blue fire for bones. These skeletons are dancing, leaping, striding, and racing around, mingling with undulating snakes of green light. Behind these is a broad mass of lesser light. Simultaneously, a sound like a shout can be heard coming from every part of the sky, even though it doesn't seem to come near them.&#10;&#10;Additionally, a tall tree on a nearby hill seems to be on fire, although it is later revealed that this is just the shadow of the tree thrown across by a secondary flash in the west.&#10;&#10;The scene is described as otherworldly and frightening, with Bathsheba initially mistaking Gabriel's voice for her husband Frank Troy's. However, it is later confirmed that Troy was waiting for her when she says, &quot;Frank, dearest, is that you?&quot; Boldwood also recognizes the voice and reacts with shock, saying, &quot;O God!&quot;&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene is a striking depiction of an intense thunderstorm, complete with flashes of light and cracks of thunder. The appearance of skeletons and snakes made of fire adds to the eerie atmosphere, creating a sense of unease and disorientation for the characters involved." />

With these were intertwined&#10;undulating snakes of green, and behind these was a broad mass of&#10;lesser light.  Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling&#10;sky what may be called a shout; since, though no shout ever came&#10;near it, it was more of the nature of a shout than of anything else&#10;earthly.  In the meantime one of the grisly forms had alighted upon&#10;the point of Gabriel's rod, to run invisibly down it, down the chain,&#10;and into the earth.  Gabriel was almost blinded, and he could feel&#10;Bathsheba's warm arm tremble in his hand--a sensation novel and&#10;thrilling enough; but love, life, everything human, seemed small and&#10;trifling in such close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe.&#10;&#10;Oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions into a thought,&#10;and to see how strangely the red feather of her hat shone in this&#10;light, when the tall tree on the hill before mentioned seemed on fire&#10;" />
    <node id=" a narrow escape!&quot; said Gabriel, hurriedly.  &quot;You had better&#10;go down.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba said nothing; but he could distinctly hear her rhythmical&#10;pants, and the recurrent rustle of the sheaf beside her in response&#10;to her frightened pulsations.  She descended the ladder, and, on&#10;second thoughts, he followed her.  The darkness was now impenetrable&#10;by the sharpest vision.  They both stood still at the bottom, side by&#10;side.  Bathsheba appeared to think only of the weather--Oak thought&#10;only of her just then.  At last he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;The storm seems to have passed now, at any rate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think so too,&quot; said Bathsheba.  &quot;Though there are multitudes of&#10;gleams, look!&quot;&#10;&#10;The sky was now filled with an incessant light, frequent repetition&#10;melting into complete continuity, as an unbroken sound results from&#10;the successive strokes on a gong.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing serious,&quot; said he.  &quot;I cannot understand no rain falling.&#10;But Heaven be praised, it is all the better for us.

Bathsheba was on the ground now, shouldering&#10;another sheaf, and she bore its dazzle without flinching--thunder&#10;and all--and again ascended with the load.  There was then a silence&#10;everywhere for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars, as&#10;Gabriel hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly heard.  He&#10;thought the crisis of the storm had passed.  But there came a burst&#10;of light.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hold on!&quot; said Gabriel, taking the sheaf from her shoulder, and&#10;grasping her arm again.&#10;&#10;Heaven opened then, indeed.  The flash was almost too novel for its&#10;inexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized, and they could&#10;only comprehend the magnificence of its beauty.  It sprang from&#10;east, west, north, south, and was a perfect dance of death.

On the slope in front of him&#10;appeared two human shapes, black as jet.  The rick lost its&#10;sheen--the shapes vanished.  Gabriel turned his head.  It had been&#10;the sixth flash which had come from the east behind him, and the two&#10;dark forms on the slope had been the shadows of himself and&#10;Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Then came the peal.  It hardly was credible that such a heavenly&#10;light could be the parent of such a diabolical sound.&#10;&#10;&quot;How terrible!&quot; she exclaimed, and clutched him by the sleeve.&#10;Gabriel turned, and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding&#10;her arm.  At the same moment, while he was still reversed in his&#10;attitude, there was more light, and he saw, as it were, a copy of the&#10;tall poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of the barn.&#10;It was the shadow of that tree, thrown across by a secondary flash&#10;in the west.&#10;&#10;The next flare came.

    <node id="The sheep are behaving strangely and huddling together due to their terror of an approaching thunderstorm, which is greater than their fear of humans.

During this time two&#10;black spiders, of the kind common in thatched houses, promenaded the&#10;ceiling, ultimately dropping to the floor.  This reminded him that&#10;if there was one class of manifestation on this matter that he&#10;thoroughly understood, it was the instincts of sheep.  He left the&#10;room, ran across two or three fields towards the flock, got upon a&#10;hedge, and looked over among them.&#10;&#10;They were crowded close together on the other side around some furze&#10;bushes, and the first peculiarity observable was that, on the sudden&#10;appearance of Oak's head over the fence, they did not stir or run&#10;away.

    <node id=" not stir or run&#10;away.  They had now a terror of something greater than their terror&#10;of man.  But this was not the most noteworthy feature: they were all&#10;grouped in such a way that their tails, without a single exception,&#10;were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm&#10;threatened.  There was an inner circle closely huddled, and outside&#10;these they radiated wider apart, the pattern formed by the flock as a&#10;whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar, to which the clump of&#10;furze-bushes stood in the position of a wearer's neck.&#10;&#10;This was enough to re-establish him in his original opinion.  He knew&#10;now that he was right, and that Troy was wrong. Every voice in nature&#10;was unanimous in bespeaking change.  But two distinct translations&#10;attached to these dumb expressions.  Apparently there was to be a&#10;thunder-storm, and afterwards a cold continuous rain.  The creeping&#10;things seemed to know all about the later rain, but little of the&#10;interpolated thunder-storm; whilst the sheep knew all about the&#10;thunder-storm and nothing of the later rain.&#10;&#10;This" />
    <node id="In the narrative, a significant event taking place on the farm is the harvest month, during which Bathsheba's corn needs to be gathered. This is a crucial time for a farmer, and Oak lends a hand despite not being bound by his agreement to assist. The broken key mentioned at the beginning of the text might be symbolic of misfortune or a bad omen, but its direct connection to the farm event is not explicitly stated. However, Bathsheba's distress about the corn and her absence from home could be related to the fallen key, as she might need it to access the barn or other necessary tools for the harvest.&#10;&#10;Cain Ball's role in this narrative seems to be a minor one, primarily serving as a source of distraction for the workers during the harvest. His arrival at the farm dressed up on a weekday suggests he has been away and is now returning. The mention of his felon and subsequent absence could indicate that he was seeking medical attention or recuperating from an injury. Cain Ball's return to the farm during the corn-harvest period might be coincidental, but it highlights the busy atmosphere on the farm and how even minor events like his arrival can momentarily shift the focus of the workers away from their tasks.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the broken key might not have a direct connection to the farm event, its symbolism as a bad omen could still be relevant in the context of Bathsheba's distress about the corn and her absence. Cain Ball's role is primarily that of a distraction during the harvest, with his arrival on the farm providing a brief interlude from their work." />

    <node id="Gabriel's bewilderment and grief were caused by the suspicion that Bathsheba might have been entrapped into marrying Troy. This suspicion arose due to the rumors about Bathsheba's fearful journey to Bath, where she had miscalculated the distance and her horse had broken down. Despite initially dispersing his dread when he saw Bathsheba return quietly with Liddy, this realization of her possible entrapment made Gabriel question the nature of her relationship with Troy.&#10;&#10;&#09;When Bathsheba returns with Liddy, Gabriel feels a sense of relief and happiness, forgetting all his grave reports. He even lingers around, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. This shows that despite his suspicion and grief, Gabriel still harbors strong feelings for Bathsheba, which are reaffirmed when he sees her safe and sound.&#10;&#10;&#09;Furthermore, Coggan's comment &quot;What difference does it make whose sweetheart she is, since she can't be yours?&quot; highlights the fact that Gabriel still has feelings for Bathsheba, even though he recognizes that she cannot be his sweetheart. This realization of Bathsheba's possible entrapment only strengthens Gabriel's resolve to move on from his unrequited love." />

    <node id="Troy's actions in revealing the newspaper article about his marriage to Bathsheba through a slit in the door he has just secured are significant because it demonstrates his confidence and mockery towards Boldwood. By doing so, Troy is asserting his dominance over Boldwood, highlighting the fact that he has already married Bathsheba, and there is nothing Boldwood can do to change that. The slit in the door and the candelight create a dramatic effect, adding to the tension and highlighting Troy's sense of superiority. Additionally, Troy's derisive laughter after making his statement further emphasizes his disdain for Boldwood's interference in his personal matters. Overall, Troy's actions are a calculated move to assert his authority and undermine Boldwood's efforts to win Bathsheba's affections." />

Will you read this&#10;a moment?  I'll hold the light.&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit between door and&#10;doorpost, and put the candle close.  &quot;That's the paragraph,&quot; he said,&#10;placing his finger on a line.&#10;&#10;Boldwood looked and read--&#10;&#10;&#10;   MARRIAGES.&#10;&#10;   On the 17th inst., at St. Ambrose's Church, Bath, by the&#10;   Rev.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the gipsies went &quot;straight on&quot; after stealing Bathsheba's horse. Oak and Coggan believe they can overtake them for several reasons. First, the next turnpike gate is manned by a notoriously sleepy keeper who will not notice their delay. Second, one of the horses has been lamed, which will slow down the escape of the thief. These factors make it more likely that Oak and Coggan will be able to catch up to the thief and recover the stolen horse. Additionally, based on the tracks and the shoeing by Old Jimmy Harris, they are confident that the mare is with the gipsies." />

Boldwood was moved&#10;by a sudden determination.  He hastened home.  In ten minutes he was&#10;back again, and made as if he were going to call upon Troy at the&#10;carrier's.  But as he approached, some one opened the door and came&#10;out.  He heard this person say &quot;Good-night&quot; to the inmates, and the&#10;voice was Troy's.

Instead, he asserts that it was Bathsheba Everdene that he saw, but he does not want to commit to a holy oath that could have severe consequences if not true.

    <node id="1. Cain's friends showed interest when he mentioned visiting Bath because it was a city with unique natural features and customs, as described by Cain. They were curious about his experiences and wanted to hear more details about the place.&#10;&#10;2. Cain's ability to speak clearly in his narrative seemed to be affected by an erratic crumb that went down the wrong way while eating, causing him to cough (hok-hok) frequently. Additionally, a sneeze made him fumble with his rather large watch, which dangled in front of another young man. These physical distractions might have caused him to lose focus and struggle to articulate his thoughts effectively." />
    <node id="The fact that one of the horses is showing signs of lameness suggests that the gipsies, who stole Bathsheba's horse, will be slowed down during their escape. This delay provides an opportunity for Oak and Coggan to catch up to them, as the notoriously sleepy turnpike keeper will not notice their delay at the next gate. The lamed horse, therefore, increases the likelihood of Oak and Coggan overtaking the thief and recovering the stolen horse." />
    <node id="1. The reason for Cain Ball's sudden appearance is that he has a bad leg, which allows him to have extra time for activities like reading &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; or learning All-Fours in a whitlow. On this particular day, he came on a weekday in his Sunday clothes, an event of significant magnitude for the harvesters.&#10;&#10;2. Cain has the habit of running while eating, despite being warned of the danger by Gabriel Oak, because he is still young and perhaps careless about the potential consequences. His physical distractions, such as coughing due to a crumb going down the wrong way and a sneeze that makes him fumble with his watch, further contribute to his inability to articulate his experiences clearly." />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba's sudden warmth towards Gabriel can be attributed to her gratitude for his devotion and assistance, as well as possibly feeling guilty for treating him poorly when she was unmarried. This interaction takes place after they have successfully saved the hay-rick from a fire, and she is likely in high spirits due to their success.&#10;&#10;2. The sound of the vane on the coach-house signifies an upcoming change in the weather because it indicates that there has been a shift in the wind, which often precedes rain. In this case, the grating noise from the coach-house is the signal for a disastrous rain, suggesting that a significant change in the weather is imminent." />
    <node id="Gabriel decided to climb down from the stack after inserting his ricking-rod when a blue light appeared and a smack sounded in the fourth larger flash of lightning because he no longer felt safe. The smart and short &quot;smack&quot; that followed the blue light, which was likely a thunderclap, made him aware of the dangerous situation he was in while on top of the tall stack during a storm. This, along with his earlier resolution to descend when the stacks were unprotected from the rain and lightning, prompted him to make the decision to climb down." />
    <node id=" there was&#10;a smack--smart, clear, and short.  Gabriel felt his position to be&#10;anything but a safe one, and he resolved to descend.&#10;&#10;Not a drop of rain had fallen as yet.  He wiped his weary brow, and&#10;looked again at the black forms of the unprotected stacks.  Was his&#10;life so valuable to him after all?  What were his prospects that he&#10;should be so chary of running risk, when important and urgent labour&#10;could not be carried on without such risk?  He resolved to stick to&#10;the stack.  However, he took a precaution.  Under the staddles was a&#10;long tethering chain, used to prevent the escape of errant horses.&#10;This he carried up the ladder, and sticking his rod through the clog&#10;at one end, allowed the other end of the chain to trail upon the&#10;ground.  The spike attached to it he drove in.  Under the shadow of&#10;this extemporized lightning-conductor he felt himself comparatively&#10;safe.&#10;&#10;Before Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again out leapt the&#10;fifth flash, with the spring of a serpent and the shout of a fiend.&#10;It was green" />

Then the picture vanished, leaving the darkness so&#10;intense that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his hands.&#10;&#10;He had stuck his ricking-rod, or poniard, as it was indifferently&#10;called--a long iron lance, polished by handling--into the stack,&#10;used to support the sheaves instead of the support called a groom&#10;used on houses.  A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some&#10;indescribable manner flickered down near the top of the rod.  It&#10;was the fourth of the larger flashes.  A moment later and there was&#10;a smack--smart, clear, and short.  Gabriel felt his position to be&#10;anything but a safe one, and he resolved to descend" />

However, Cain refuses to swear on it in a solemn oath due to the potential consequences of making false statements under such an oath.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's relationship with Troy is complicated. Despite initially deciding to end their relationship and stay away from Weatherbury, she ultimately chooses to meet with him again due to her deep love for him. This demonstrates the power of her emotions and her attachment to Troy, despite the potential negative consequences of their relationship.&#10;&#10;Other characters have varying opinions regarding Bathsheba's relationship with Troy. Gabriel Oak, who has feelings for Bathsheba himself, is concerned about her involvement with Troy. Meanwhile, Farmer Boldwood expresses jealousy and resentment towards Troy, particularly when he learns that Troy also has feelings for Fanny Robin. However, it's worth noting that Cain Ball is the only character who actually witnesses Bathsheba with Troy in a manner that suggests they are courting." />

    <edge source="Based on the account of Cain Ball, a young man who has visited Bath, we can gather some information about the city.

This is a crucial time for a farmer, and Oak lends a hand despite not being bound by his agreement to assist. The broken key mentioned at the beginning of the text might be symbolic of misfortune or a bad omen, but its direct connection to the farm event is not explicitly stated. However, Bathsheba's distress about the corn and her absence from home could be related to the fallen key, as she might need it to access the barn or other necessary tools for the harvest.&#10;&#10;Cain Ball's role in this narrative seems to be a minor one, primarily serving as a source of distraction for the workers during the harvest. His arrival at the farm dressed up on a weekday suggests he has been away and is now returning. The mention of his felon and subsequent absence could indicate that he was seeking medical attention or recuperating from an injury. Cain Ball's return to the farm during the corn-harvest period might be coincidental, but it highlights the busy atmosphere on the farm and how even minor events like his arrival can momentarily shift the focus of the workers away from their tasks.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the broken key might not have a direct connection to the farm event, its symbolism as a bad omen could still be relevant in the context of Bathsheba's distress about the corn and her absence. Cain Ball's role is primarily that of a distraction during the harvest, with his arrival on the farm providing a brief interlude from their work.">

This is a crucial time for a farmer, and Oak lends a hand despite not being bound by his agreement to assist. The broken key mentioned at the beginning of the text might be symbolic of misfortune or a bad omen, but its direct connection to the farm event is not explicitly stated. However, Bathsheba's distress about the corn and her absence from home could be related to the fallen key, as she might need it to access the barn or other necessary tools for the harvest.&#10;&#10;Cain Ball's role in this narrative seems to be a minor one, primarily serving as a source of distraction for the workers during the harvest. His arrival at the farm dressed up on a weekday suggests he has been away and is now returning. The mention of his felon and subsequent absence could indicate that he was seeking medical attention or recuperating from an injury. Cain Ball's return to the farm during the corn-harvest period might be coincidental, but it highlights the busy atmosphere on the farm and how even minor events like his arrival can momentarily shift the focus of the workers away from their tasks.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the broken key might not have a direct connection to the farm event, its symbolism as a bad omen could still be relevant in the context of Bathsheba's distress about the corn and her absence. Cain Ball's role is primarily that of a distraction during the harvest, with his arrival on the farm providing a brief interlude from their work.">

Instead of traditional beverages, the people of Bath drink this hot water, which seems unusual to outsiders. The city has large glass windows in shops and is surrounded by countryside with old wooden trees. The architecture in Bath includes imposing or grand buildings.&#10;&#10;Cain also mentions that the attire of the people in Bath is different, as evidenced by Miss Everdene wearing a gold-colored silk gown with black trimming. He encountered a soldier during his visit as well. Despite the distinctive characteristics of Bath, Cain notes a drawback: God did not provide them with easily available food, which he found to be a significant issue.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bath is a city with unique natural features, including hot springs and a rural countryside. The buildings are grand, and the people have distinct attire and customs. However, there is no readily available food source, making it difficult for inhabitants to obtain sustenance.">

However, it can be inferred that they might have been celebrating or holding an event that involved alcohol, which led to their excessive drinking and subsequent unconsciousness.

The lamed horse, therefore, increases the likelihood of Oak and Coggan overtaking the thief and recovering the stolen horse.">

    <node id="The type of energy source that was suggested for the remote control, aside from batteries, is a hand-dynamo. A hand-dynamo works by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In this context, when the remote control is &quot;cranked&quot; or moved, it causes the dynamo to generate an electric current that can power the device. This type of energy source could be useful for a remote control because it would not require disposable batteries and could potentially last longer. Additionally, as movement generates the power, it may help ensure that the remote control is always ready to use." />

    <node id=" , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our {vocalsound} uh in our findings we have seen that {disfmarker} when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third" />
    <node id=" This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Oh here it is . {vocalsound} Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make .&#10;Speaker" />

    <node id="The design of certain buttons, such as the volume control, might be confusing or counterintuitive in this user interface because of inconsistent layout and labeling. In the transcript, the User Interface speaker mentions that remote controls often use a graphical interface with buttons, but there is inconsistency in the layout, which can make it difficult to use. In the case of the volume control, the shape of the button might suggest one action (pressing down), but the actual result is the opposite (increasing volume). This discrepancy between expectation and outcome can create confusion for users." />

    <node id="1. The most important factor in designing remote controls is creating a fancy and appealing design for the mobile outlook, which is twice as important as the second factor. This is stated by the Marketing speaker, who emphasizes that the remote control should have a sophisticated look and feel, rather than just being functional.&#10;&#10;2. The second most important aspect to consider is making the remote control technologically innovative with advanced features such as glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition functionality. This factor was also suggested by the Marketing speaker." />

    <node id="1. Customizable shape of the product: Both the Marketing and Project Manager speakers suggest that the remote control can have customizable shapes, such as banana or apple, depending on the customer's preference. This can be achieved by providing different casings for the device. The Industrial Designer seems open to this idea and plans to involve the marketing team in conducting a public survey to determine what shape is preferred.&#10;2. Button placement: According to the User Interface speaker, buttons will be located on the upper side of the remote control. Marketing adds that while holding the remote from one side, users can choose between different appearances (e.g., banana or apple) without changing button placement. The Project Manager reiterates that buttons should remain in their standard places for specific functions like up, down, play, and stop. This is agreed upon by the Industrial Designer as well." />
    <node id=" the buttons in the same places thought ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: don't we ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: You can standardise those , I mean .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Oh , that's the other side .

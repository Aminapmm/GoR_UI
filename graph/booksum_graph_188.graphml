    <node id="Colonel Crawley hurried to Gaunt House to see Lord Steyne in response to a flaming account he had read in the Observer newspaper about &quot;Festivities at Gaunt House.&quot; He wanted to discuss an appointment that appeared in the journals of that day, which was a proof of his kindness to Lord Steyne and an opportunity to communicate about the recent conflict between them. The appointment was for Colonel Crawley to be all day after one o'clock at the Regent Club in St. James's Street, not at home, as he did not want to be found by Lord Steyne's servants." />

The man was scared also&#10;by the Colonel's dishevelled appearance, and barred the way as if&#10;afraid that the other was going to force it.

And by the sermon-book&#10;was the Observer newspaper, damp and neatly folded, and for Sir Pitt's&#10;own private use.  His gentleman alone took the opportunity of perusing&#10;the newspaper before he laid it by his master's desk.  Before he had&#10;brought it into the study that morning, he had read in the journal a&#10;flaming account of &quot;Festivities at Gaunt House,&quot; with the names of all&#10;the distinguished personages invited by the Marquis of Steyne to meet&#10;his Royal Highness.  Having made comments upon this entertainment to&#10;the housekeeper and her niece as they were taking early tea and hot&#10;buttered toast in the former lady's apartment, and wondered how the&#10;Rawding Crawleys could git on, the valet had damped and folded the&#10;paper once more, so that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the&#10;arrival of the master of the house.&#10;&#10;Poor Rawdon took" />

The people joked&#10;at the cab-stand about his appearance, as he took a carriage there, and&#10;told the driver to drive him to Knightsbridge Barracks.&#10;&#10;All the bells were jangling and tolling as he reached that place. He&#10;might have seen his old acquaintance Amelia on her way from Brompton to&#10;Russell Square, had he been looking out.  Troops of schools were on&#10;their march to church, the shiny pavement and outsides of coaches in&#10;the suburbs were thronged with people out upon their Sunday pleasure;&#10;but the Colonel was much too busy to take any heed of these phenomena,&#10;and, arriving at" />

What was this&#10;very appointment, which appears in the journals of to-day, but a proof&#10;of his kindness to you? When I saw his Lordship this morning I found&#10;him in a state pitiable indeed to see, and as anxious as you are to&#10;revenge the outrage committed upon him, by blood.  You know he has&#10;given his proofs, I presume, Colonel Crawley?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He has plenty of pluck,&quot; said the Colonel.  &quot;Nobody ever said he&#10;hadn't.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;His first order to me was to write a letter of challenge, and to carry&#10;it to Colonel Crawley.  One or other of us,&quot; he said, &quot;must not survive&#10;the outrage of last night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Crawley nodded.  &quot;You're coming to the point, Wenham,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I tried my utmost to calm Lord Steyne.

And he was anxious,&#10;on the Colonel's behalf, to give up the note to its owner.&#10;&#10;By the time this note was composed, the Captain's servant returned from&#10;his mission to Colonel Crawley's house in Curzon Street, but without&#10;the carpet-bag and portmanteau, for which he had been sent, and with a&#10;very puzzled and odd face.&#10;&#10;&quot;They won't give 'em up,&quot;" />

This incident sheds light on Becky's precarious situation, as it shows that she has powerful enemies who are actively working against her and that her servants may not be entirely trustworthy. Additionally, the fact that Becky's servants prioritize the orders of Lady Jane over hers suggests that Becky's position in society is tenuous and that she does not have the same level of control or respect as her social betters. The situation also highlights the class dynamics at play, with the servants being loyal to their employer's employer, rather than to Becky herself." />

Where was Lady Jane Crawley?&#10;She was at church.  Becky was not sorry. Sir Pitt was in his study, and&#10;had given orders not to be disturbed--she must see him--she slipped by&#10;the sentinel in livery at once, and was in Sir Pitt's room before the&#10;astonished Baronet had even laid down the paper.&#10;&#10;He turned red and started back from her with a look of great alarm and&#10;horror.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do not look so,&quot; she said.  &quot;I am not guilty, Pitt, dear Pitt; you&#10;were my friend once.  Before God, I am not guilty.  I seem so.&#10;Everything is against me.  And oh!  at such a moment!  just when all my&#10;hopes were about to be realized:  just when happiness was in store for&#10;us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is this true, what I see in the paper then?&quot; Sir Pitt said--a&#10;paragraph in which had greatly surprised him.&#10;&#10;" />

The liquor appeared&#10;to give the odious rebel courage.&#10;&#10;&quot;YOUR sofy, indeed!&quot; Mrs. Cook said.  &quot;I'm a settin' on Mrs. Raggles's&#10;sofy.  Don't you stir, Mrs. Raggles, Mum. I'm a settin' on Mr. and Mrs.&#10;Raggles's sofy, which they bought with honest money, and very dear it&#10;cost 'em, too.  And I'm thinkin' if I set here until I'm paid my wages,&#10;I shall set a precious long time, Mrs. Raggles; and set I will,&#10;too--ha!  ha!&quot; and with this she filled herself another glass of the&#10;liquor and drank it with a more hideously satirical air.&#10;&#10;&quot;Trotter!

    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is this true, what I see in the paper then?&quot; Sir Pitt said--a&#10;paragraph in which had greatly surprised him.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is true.  Lord Steyne told me on Friday night, the night of that&#10;fatal ball.  He has been promised an appointment any time these six&#10;months.  Mr. Martyr, the Colonial Secretary, told him yesterday that it&#10;was made out. That unlucky arrest ensued; that horrible meeting. I was&#10;only guilty of too much devotedness to Rawdon's service.  I have&#10;received Lord Steyne alone a hundred times before. I confess I had&#10;money of which Rawdon knew nothing. Don't you know how careless he is&#10;of it, and could I dare to confide it to him?&quot; And so she went on with&#10;a perfectly connected story, which she poured into the ears of her&#10;perplexed kinsman.&#10;&#10;It was to the following effect.

Mac put out one finger, armed with a buckskin&#10;glove, and made a very frigid bow to Mr. Wenham over his tight cravat.&#10;He was, perhaps, discontented at being put in communication with a&#10;pekin, and thought that Lord Steyne should have sent him a Colonel at&#10;the very least.&#10;&#10;&quot;As Macmurdo acts for me, and knows what I mean,&quot; Crawley said, &quot;" />

The good looks, gallant bearing,&#10;and gentlemanlike appearance of the boy won the grandsire's heart for&#10;him.  Mr. Osborne was as proud of him as ever he had been of the elder&#10;George.&#10;&#10;The child had many more luxuries and indulgences than had been awarded&#10;his father.  Osborne's commerce had prospered greatly of late years.&#10;His wealth and importance in the City had very much increased.  He had&#10;been glad enough in former days to put the elder George to" />

His voice trembled with pleasure as he&#10;greeted the boy, and taking both the other's hands in his own, drew the&#10;lad to him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your mother has talked to you about me--has she?&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;That she has,&quot; Georgy answered, &quot;hundreds and hundreds of times.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

The old lady grudged her even those rare&#10;visits; she, who had been a kind, smiling, good-natured mother once, in&#10;the days of her prosperity, but whom poverty and infirmities had broken&#10;down.  Her illness or estrangement did not affect Amelia.  They rather&#10;enabled her to support the other calamity under which she was&#10;suffering, and from the thoughts of which she was kept by the ceaseless&#10;calls of the invalid.  Amelia bore her harshness quite gently; smoothed&#10;the uneasy pillow; was always ready with a soft answer to the watchful,&#10;querulous voice; soothed the sufferer with words of hope, such as her&#10;pious simple heart could best" />

The old man would start at some hereditary feature or tone&#10;unconsciously used by the little lad, and fancy that George's father&#10;was again before him.  He tried by indulgence to the grandson to make&#10;up for harshness to the elder George.  People were surprised at his&#10;gentleness to the boy.  He growled and swore at Miss Osborne as usual,&#10;and would smile when George came down late for breakfast.&#10;&#10;Miss Osborne, George's aunt, was a faded old spinster, broken down by&#10;more than forty years of dulness and coarse usage.  It was easy for a&#10;lad of spirit to master her. And whenever George wanted anything from&#10;her, from the jam-pots in her cupboards to the cracked and dry old&#10;colours in her paint-box (the old paint-box which she had had when she&#10;was a pupil of Mr. Smee and was still almost young and blooming),&#10;Georgy took possession of the object of his desire, which obtained, he&#10;took no further notice of his aunt.&#10;&#10;For his friends and cronies, he had a pompous old schoolmaster, who" />

He received praise and rewards for his progress, which boosted his ego and made him feel good about himself.&#10;&#10;4. The contrast between the coarse pomposity of his grandfather and the simplicity and delicacy of Amelia also made him lord over her, further distracting him from missing her.&#10;&#10;5. He was brought up by a kind, weak, and tender woman who instilled in him good manners and humility, making him think well of himself.&#10;&#10;Therefore, with all these consolations, distractions, and self-esteem, Master George Osborne had no trouble bearing the separation from Amelia easily." />

Little boys who cry when they are&#10;going to school cry because they are going to a very uncomfortable&#10;place.  It is only a few who weep from sheer affection.  When you think&#10;that the eyes of your childhood dried at the sight of a piece of&#10;gingerbread, and that a plum cake was a compensation for the agony of&#10;parting with your mamma and sisters, oh my friend and brother, you need&#10;not be too confident of your own fine feelings.&#10;&#10;Well, then, Master George Osborne had every comfort and luxury that a&#10;wealthy and lavish old grandfather thought fit to provide.  The&#10;coachman was instructed to purchase for him the handsomest pony which&#10;could be bought for money, and on this George was taught to ride, first&#10;at a riding-school, whence, after having performed satisfactor" />

She busied herself in gentle offices and&#10;quiet duties; if she never said brilliant things, she never spoke or&#10;thought unkind ones; guileless and artless, loving and pure, indeed how&#10;could our poor little Amelia be other than a real gentlewoman!&#10;&#10;Young Georgy lorded over this soft and yielding nature; and the&#10;contrast of its simplicity and delicacy with the coarse pomposity of&#10;the dull old man with whom he next came in contact made him lord over&#10;the latter too.

It was a miniature of&#10;himself, very prettily done (though not half handsome enough, we may be&#10;sure, the widow thought).  His grandfather had wished to have a picture&#10;of him by an artist whose works, exhibited in a shop-window, in&#10;Southampton Row, had caught the old gentleman's eye; and George, who&#10;had plenty of money, bethought him of asking the painter how much a&#10;copy of the little portrait would cost, saying that he would pay for it&#10;out of his own money and that he wanted to give it to his mother.  The&#10;pleased painter executed it for a small price, and old Osborne himself,&#10;when he heard of the incident, growled out his satisfaction and gave&#10;the boy twice as many sovereigns as he paid for the miniature.&#10;&#10;But what was the grandfather's pleasure compared to Amelia's ecstacy?&#10;That proof of the boy's affection charmed her so that she thought no&#10;child in the world was like hers for goodness.  For long weeks after,&#10;the thought of his love made her happy. " />
    <node id=" humble presents had been put aside--I&#10;believe Miss Osborne had given them to the coachman's boy.  Amelia&#10;tried to think she was pleased at the change.  Indeed, she was happy&#10;and charmed to see the boy looking so beautiful.&#10;&#10;She had had a little black profile of him done for a shilling, and this&#10;was hung up by the side of another portrait over her bed.  One day the&#10;boy came on his accustomed visit, galloping down the little street at&#10;Brompton, and bringing, as usual, all the inhabitants to the windows to&#10;admire his splendour, and with great eagerness and a look of triumph in&#10;his face, he pulled a case out of his great-coat--it was a natty white&#10;great-coat, with a cape and a velvet collar--pulled out a red morocco&#10;case, which he gave her.&#10;&#10;&quot;I bought it with my own money, Mamma,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought you'd like&#10;it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia opened the case, and giving a little cry of delighted affection,&#10;seized the boy and embraced him a hundred times.

He was sent to make arrangements for a meeting with Colonel Crawley, who had challenged Lord Steyne to a duel.&#10;2. Macmurdo seemed discontented with the level of recognition shown by Lord Steyne because he thought that as an emissary of Lord Steyne, Mr. Wenham should have introduced himself at a higher rank, such as a Colonel. Macmurdo's displeasure likely stems from his own military background and his perception of proper protocol. He may have felt that the level of recognition shown was not commensurate with the importance or seriousness of the situation at hand." />
    <node id="Rawdon is in a state of agitation and distress as he waits for Sir Pitt to arrive. He is unable to focus on the newspaper because his mind is preoccupied with the recent events concerning his wife Becky and her relationship with Lord Steyne. The passage mentions that Rawdon's &quot;blood-shot eyes, and his hair over his face&quot; and that he had been out all night, but not due to any orgy, but most likely from worry and lack of sleep. Additionally, the mention of the &quot;flaming account of 'Festivities at Gaunt House'&quot; and the &quot;Gaunt House chronicle&quot; which contained a account of the famous charades with Becky as the heroine, would have added fuel to his anxiety and made it difficult for him to focus on the newspaper." />

But the print fell blank upon his eyes, and he&#10;did not know in the least what he was reading.

He started when he saw poor Rawdon in his study in tumbled&#10;clothes, with blood-shot eyes, and his hair over his face.  He thought&#10;his brother was not sober, and had been out all night on some orgy.&#10;&quot;Good gracious, Rawdon,&quot; he said, with a blank face, &quot;what brings you&#10;here at this time of the morning?

Even&#10;after that horrid arrest took place (the expenses of which Lord Steyne&#10;generously said he would settle, so that I was in a manner prevented&#10;from coming to my husband's assistance), my Lord was laughing with me,&#10;and saying that my dearest Rawdon would be consoled when he read of his&#10;appointment in the paper, in that shocking spun--bailiff's house. And&#10;then--then he came home.  His suspicions were excited,--the dreadful&#10;scene took place between my Lord and my cruel, cruel Rawdon--and, O my&#10;God, what will happen next?

Rawdon muttered some&#10;excuses about an engagement, squeezing hard the timid little hand which&#10;his sister-in-law reached out to him.  Her imploring eyes could read&#10;nothing but calamity in his face, but he went away without another&#10;word.  Nor did Sir Pitt vouchsafe her any explanation. The children&#10;came up to salute him, and he kissed them in his usual frigid manner.&#10;The mother took both of them close to herself, and held a hand of each&#10;of them as they knelt down to prayers, which Sir Pitt read to them, and&#10;to the servants in their Sunday suits or liveries, ranged upon chairs&#10;on the other side of the hissing tea" />
    <node id="Becky urgently seeks an audience with Sir Pitt Crawley because she has been accused of improper behavior with Lord Steyne. This situation has been exacerbated by the fact that Becky's husband, Rawdon Crawley, has recently been arrested, and Becky fears that this development will further damage her reputation.&#10;&#10;The revelation that has caused alarm to Sir Pitt is a newspaper article reporting on the arrest of Rawdon Crawley and implying that Becky is having an affair with Lord Steyne. This information has greatly surprised Sir Pitt, as evidenced by his question to Becky about the veracity of the report. The article would have added fuel to Rawdon's anxiety and made it difficult for him to focus on the newspaper.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky seeks out Sir Pitt in a state of desperation because she has been accused of improper behavior with Lord Steyne, and this accusation has been exacerbated by her husband's recent arrest. The newspaper article reporting on these events has caused alarm to Sir Pitt, who is shocked by the revelations contained therein." />
    <node id="1. The reason for Lord Steyne's agent, Macmurdo, giving a thousand-pound note to Mr. Wenham is not explicitly stated in the text. However, it can be inferred that it may have been some form of payment or compensation related to the situation involving Colonel Crawley and Lord Steyne.&#10;2. The mistake that Macmurdo referred to in his conversation with Mr. Wenham was likely the circumstances surrounding the challenge to a duel between Colonel Crawley and Lord Steyne. Macmurdo suggests that Mrs. Crawley had asked them to sup after the opera, implying that there may have been some level of deception or misunderstanding involved in the situation." />
    <node id="1. The confrontation between Becky, Mrs. Crawley (Lady Jane), Trotter, and Simpson is a tense and dramatic scene. When Becky orders the footmen to remove a drunken man from her home, they refuse to follow her commands, stating that they are in the service of Lady Jane and will only take orders from her. This indicates that Becky's position in society is tenuous and that she does not have the same level of control or respect as her social betters.&#10;2. The footmen's refusal to obey Becky's orders also highlights the class dynamics at play, with the servants being loyal to their employer's employer (Lady Jane) rather than to Becky herself. This is further emphasized by Trotter's insulting behavior towards Becky, calling her a swindler and refusing to take orders from her.&#10;3. The confrontation also reveals that Becky's husband, Rawdon Crawley, may have left her and taken his belongings with him. This development is likely to have further damaged Becky's reputation and increased her desperation as she seeks out Sir Pitt for help.&#10;4. Overall, the confrontation between Becky, Mrs. Crawley, Trotter, and Simpson reveals that Becky is in a precarious position, with powerful enemies working against her and servants who may not be entirely trustworthy. It also highlights the class dynamics at play and the challenges that Becky faces as a woman trying to navigate high society." />

She accuses Becky of being a heartless mother and a false wife, and claims that she has deceived everyone with her wicked flattery and falsehoods.&#10;2. Lady Jane also believes that Becky's soul is black with vanity, worldliness, and all sorts of crime, and that she is not worthy to sit down with Christian people. She is so opposed to having Becky in her home that she threatens to leave with her children if Sir Pitt allows Becky to stay.&#10;3. Lady Jane's reasons for keeping her children away from Becky are based on her belief that Becky is a bad influence and a danger to her family. She claims that Becky has deceived her husband and everyone else, and that she cannot be trusted.&#10;4. In summary, Lady Jane views Becky as a dishonest and immoral woman who is trying to bring misery to her family and weaken the most sacred affections with her wicked flattery and falsehoods. She is so concerned about the harm that Becky could cause that she is willing to leave her own home rather than allow Becky to stay." />
    <node id="Georgy's upbringing by his kind and humble mother played a significant role in making him a better gentleman than his grandfather's plans could have. His mother, being gentle, guileless, artless, loving, and pure, created an environment where Georgy was surrounded by goodness and meekness. This upbringing contrasted sharply with the coarse pomposity of his dull old grandfather, whom Georgy now resembled in appearance and behavior due to his new circumstances.&#10;&#10;Being brought up by his mother instilled in Georgy a sense of self-worth, maturity, assertiveness, and imperiousness. The servants noted these qualities and compared him favorably to his father. Despite the absence of his mother, Georgy adapted well to his new life, enjoying luxuries and country rides during holidays.&#10;&#10;The fact that Georgy's previous humble and contracted education made him a better gentleman than his grandfather's plans suggests emphasizes the positive impact of his mother's influence on Georgy's character. The values he learned from her, such as kindness, humility, and love, shaped him into a more respectable and well-rounded individual than his grandfather's plans might have achieved." />

The wealth of his grandfather was reported in the school to be&#10;prodigious.  The Rev.

The conversazioni hosted by Mr. Bluck provided Amelia with a social life outside her home and an opportunity to see Georgy coming to school there. These monthly gatherings were intellectual discussions over weak tea and helped Amelia take her mind off missing George, as she thought them delicious so long as she could sit next to him.&#10;3. While the text does not provide explicit details on how these conversazioni shaped George's education, it can be inferred that they exposed him to scientific conversation and intellectual discussions at a young age, which may have contributed to his development.&#10;4.

The landlord had come in and taken over the house, as he believed that Rawdon had run off with the plate. One of the servants, who was drunk and noisy, had refused to let anything leave the house until his wages were paid up.&#10;&#10;The incident caused a mixture of astonishment and amusement for two officers, who laughed at Rawdon's discomfiture. Rawdon himself was glad that his son was not present during this incident, as he remembered how well the boy had sat on a horse in the Riding School. The passage also hints at some recent events concerning Rawdon's wife Becky and her relationship with Lord Steyne, which would have added to Rawdon's anxiety and made it difficult for him to focus on his newspaper.&#10;&#10;Overall, the incident described was a significant disruption in Rawdon's household, caused by a combination of drunkenness, disorderly behavior, and unpaid wages.

    <node id="&quot;It may be so,&quot; Rawdon answered sadly, &quot;but this don't look very&#10;innocent&quot;:  and he showed the Captain the thousand-pound note which he&#10;had found in Becky's pocket-book.  &quot;This is what he gave her, Mac, and&#10;she kep it unknown to me; and with this money in the house, she refused&#10;to stand by me when I was locked up.&quot; The Captain could not but own&#10;that the secreting of the money had a very ugly look.&#10;&#10;Whilst they were engaged in their conference, Rawdon dispatched Captain&#10;Macmurdo's servant to Curzon Street, with an order to the domestic&#10;there to give up a bag of clothes of which the Colonel had great need.&#10;And during the man's absence, and with great labour and a Johnson's&#10;Dictionary, which stood them in much stead, Rawdon and his second&#10;composed a letter, which the latter was to send to Lord Steyne.&#10;Captain Macmurdo had the honour of waiting upon the Marquis of Steyne,&#10;on the part of Colonel Rawdon Crawley, and begged to intimate that he&#10;was empowered by the Colonel to make any arrangements for the meeting" />
    <node id=" him down and thrashed him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Serve him right,&quot; Macmurdo said.  &quot;Who is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;Rawdon answered it was Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;&quot;The deuce!  a Marquis!  they said he--that is, they said you--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What the devil do you mean?&quot; roared out Rawdon; &quot;do you mean that you&#10;ever heard a fellow doubt about my wife and didn't tell me, Mac?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The world's very censorious, old boy,&quot; the other replied.  &quot;What the&#10;deuce was the good of my telling you what any tom-fools talked about?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was damned unfriendly, Mac,&quot; said Rawdon, quite overcome; and,&#10;covering his face with his hands, he gave way to an emotion, the sight&#10;of which caused the tough old campaigner opposite him to wince with&#10;sympathy. &quot;Hold up, old boy,&quot; he said; &quot;great man or not, we'll put a&#10;bullet in him, damn him.  As for women, they're all so.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't know how fond I was of that one,&quot; Rawdon said" />
    <node id=" seeing the&#10;savage look with which Rawdon answered the expression of this opinion,&#10;Macmurdo did not think fit to enlarge upon it further.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is there no way out of it, old boy?&quot; the Captain continued in a grave&#10;tone.  &quot;Is it only suspicion, you know, or--or what is it? Any letters?&#10;Can't you keep it quiet? Best not make any noise about a thing of that&#10;sort if you can help it.&quot; &quot;Think of his only finding her out now,&quot; the&#10;Captain thought to himself, and remembered a hundred particular&#10;conversations at the mess-table, in which Mrs. Crawley's reputation had&#10;been torn to shreds.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's no way but one out of it,&quot; Rawdon replied--&quot;and there's only a&#10;way out of it for one of us, Mac--do you understand? I was put out of&#10;the way--arrested--I found 'em alone together.  I told him he was a&#10;liar and a coward, and knocked him down and thrashed him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Serve him right,&quot; Macmurdo said.  &quot;Who is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;Rawdon answered" />
    <node id="1. Georgy's kind and humble upbringing by his mother played a significant role in making him a gentleman by instilling values such as kindness, humility, love, and self-worth. These qualities shaped him into a more respectable and well-rounded individual than his grandfather's plans might have achieved.&#10;2. This upbringing also made Georgy more assertive and imperious, allowing him to adapt well to his new life in his grandfather's mansion. He became more mature for his age, sitting in the dining room after breakfast and reading the Morning Post like a grown-up man. The servants observed how much Georgy resembled his father in appearance and behavior, which delighted them.&#10;3. Georgy's kind upbringing influenced his interactions with his pompous grandfather by enabling him to win over his grandsire with his good looks, gallant bearing, and gentlemanly appearance. His grandfather became proud of him, just as he was of Georgy's father. This shared resemblance helped build a fond relationship between the two.&#10;4. In summary, Georgy's upbringing contributed to his behavior and self-perception by making him more assertive, mature, and gentlemanly. It also positively affected his relationship with his grandfather by allowing them to bond over their resemblance and shared qualities." />
    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, Mr. Macmurdo is a captain in the Life Guards Green and an acquaintance of Rawdon Crawley. He is known for being skilled and prudent in handling sensitive matters for his friends and has a reputation as a &quot;common refuge of gentlemen in trouble.&quot;&#10;2. The description of Macmurdo's room and current activity suggests that he is someone who takes his responsibilities seriously and is trustworthy. His room is described as &quot;the apartment of a man of business&quot; with &quot;a table covered with papers, and an office chair drawn up to it.&quot; This indicates that Macmurdo is currently engaged in some kind of official or professional activity. The fact that he is able to drop what he is doing and give his full attention to Rawdon when called upon as a friend further demonstrates his reliability and loyalty." />
    <node id="ache.&#10;&#10;When Rawdon told the Captain he wanted a friend, the latter knew&#10;perfectly well on what duty of friendship he was called to act, and&#10;indeed had conducted scores of affairs for his acquaintances with the&#10;greatest prudence and skill.  His Royal Highness the late lamented&#10;Commander-in-Chief had had the greatest regard for Macmurdo on this&#10;account, and he was the common refuge of gentlemen in trouble.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the row about, Crawley, my boy?&quot; said the old warrior.  &quot;No&#10;more gambling business, hay, like that when we shot Captain Marker?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's about--about my wife,&quot; Crawley answered, casting down his eyes&#10;and turning very red.&#10;&#10;The other gave a whistle.  &quot;I always said she'd throw you over,&quot; he&#10;began--indeed there were bets in the regiment and at the clubs&#10;regarding the probable fate of Colonel Crawley, so lightly was his&#10;wife's character esteemed by his comrades and the world; but seeing the&#10;savage look with which Rawdon answered the expression of this opinion,&#10;Macmurdo did not think fit to enlarge upon it further." />
    <node id="The purpose of Colonel Fogey, Mr. Sergeant Toffy, and George's grandfather encouraging rough behavior and fights among young boys was based on the old man's vague notion that quarreling makes boys hardy, and that tyranny is a useful accomplishment for them to learn. This perspective reflects the belief, which was prevalent during that time, that such behaviors help children become stronger and more resilient. It should be noted that this view is not supported by modern child development research, which emphasizes the importance of empathy, kindness, and constructive conflict resolution skills for children's social-emotional growth." />
    <node id="so much as they pleased the old gentleman.  It gave Mr. Justice Coffin&#10;no pleasure to hear Georgy cut into the conversation and spoil his&#10;stories. Colonel Fogey was not interested in seeing the little boy half&#10;tipsy.  Mr. Sergeant Toffy's lady felt no particular gratitude, when,&#10;with a twist of his elbow, he tilted a glass of port-wine over her&#10;yellow satin and laughed at the disaster; nor was she better pleased,&#10;although old Osborne was highly delighted, when Georgy &quot;whopped&quot; her&#10;third boy (a young gentleman a year older than Georgy, and by chance&#10;home for the holidays from Dr. Tickleus's at Ealing School) in Russell&#10;Square. George's grandfather gave the boy a couple of sovereigns for&#10;that feat and promised to reward him further for every boy above his&#10;own size and age whom he whopped in a similar manner.  It is difficult&#10;to say what good the old man saw in these combats; he had a vague&#10;notion that quarrelling made boys hardy, and that tyranny was a useful&#10;accomplishment for them to learn.

It was but&#10;a year since the young Cornet, now so knowing a hand in Cribb's&#10;parlour, had a still lingering liking for toffy, and used to be birched&#10;at Eton.&#10;&#10;So they went on talking about dancers, fights, drinking, demireps,&#10;until Macmurdo came down and joined the boys and the conversation. He&#10;did not appear to think that any especial reverence was due to their&#10;boyhood; the old fellow cut in with stories, to the full as choice as&#10;any the youngest rake present had to tell--nor did his own grey hairs&#10;nor their smooth faces detain him.  Old Mac was famous for his good&#10;stories.  He was not exactly a lady's" />
    <node id="arrelling made boys hardy, and that tyranny was a useful&#10;accomplishment for them to learn.  English youth have been so educated&#10;time out of mind, and we have hundreds of thousands of apologists and&#10;admirers of injustice, misery, and brutality, as perpetrated among&#10;children.  Flushed with praise and victory over Master Toffy, George&#10;wished naturally to pursue his conquests further, and one day as he was&#10;strutting about in prodigiously dandified new clothes, near St.&#10;Pancras, and a young baker's boy made sarcastic comments upon his&#10;appearance, the youthful patrician pulled off his dandy jacket with&#10;great spirit, and giving it in charge to the friend who accompanied him&#10;(Master Todd, of Great Coram Street, Russell Square, son of the junior&#10;partner of the house of Osborne and Co.), George tried to whop the&#10;little baker.  But the chances of war were unfavourable this time, and&#10;the little baker whopped Georgy, who came home with a rueful black eye&#10;and all his fine shirt frill dabbled with the claret drawn from his own&#10;little nose. " />
    <node id="Mrs. Osborne, George's aunt, greatly enjoys her evenings with Georgy, as evidenced by her tearful gratitude and embraces for Mrs. Veal, who hosts the gatherings. She appreciates the delightful time she spends with Georgy, especially when he is accompanied by his master, Mr. Rowson.&#10;&#10;As for Georgy's studies, his progress under the guidance of this &quot;valuable master of a hundred sciences&quot; has been remarkable, as indicated by the weekly reports sent to his grandfather. He excels in various branches of knowledge, including Greek, Latin, and French, and receives top marks and prizes for his achievements. The old man, George's grandfather, takes pride in Georgy's progress, noticing similarities between the young boy and his late father.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mrs. Osborne finds joy in her time spent with Georgy and is proud of his academic accomplishments under this skilled master." />

And she would walk from Brompton in any weather,&#10;and embrace Mrs. Veal with tearful gratitude for the delightful evening&#10;she had passed, when, the company having retired and Georgy gone off&#10;with Mr. Rowson, his attendant, poor Mrs. Osborne put on her cloaks and&#10;her shawls preparatory to walking home.&#10;&#10;As for the learning which Georgy imbibed under this valuable master of&#10;a hundred sciences, to judge from the weekly reports which the lad took&#10;home to his grandfather, his progress was remarkable.  The names of a&#10;score or more of desirable branches of knowledge were printed in a&#10;table, and the pupil's progress in each was marked by the professor.&#10;In Greek Georgy was pronounced aristos, in Latin optimus, in French&#10;tres bien, and so forth; and everybody had prizes for everything at the&#10;end of the year.

It&#10;must be owned that he accommodated himself very willingly to this&#10;arrangement.  Most people do so.  And Georgy liked to play the part of&#10;master and perhaps had a natural aptitude for it.&#10;&#10;In Russell Square everybody was afraid of Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Osborne&#10;was afraid of Georgy.  The boy's dashing manners, and offhand rattle&#10;about books and learning, his likeness to his father (dead unreconciled&#10;in Brussels yonder) awed the old gentleman and gave the young boy the&#10;mastery.

    <node id="Rawdon Crawley, the younger brother of Sir Pitt, appears unexpectedly and in a disheveled state at Sir Pitt's home early in the morning. The reason for his appearance is his distress and agitation regarding the recent events concerning his wife Becky and her relationship with Lord Steyne. He wants to speak to his brother in private to discuss these matters, as he has discovered his wife's betrayal and plans to confront Lord Steyne, intending to leave his young son Rawdon in the care of his brother. The passage provides context for Rawdon's state, mentioning his &quot;tumbled clothes, with blood-shot eyes, and his hair over his face,&quot; and that he had been out all night due to worry and lack of sleep rather than any orgy." />
    <node id=" little Rawdon I'd&#10;have cut my throat this morning--and that damned villain's too.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt instantly guessed the truth and surmised that Lord Steyne was&#10;the person whose life Rawdon wished to take.  The Colonel told his&#10;senior briefly, and in broken accents, the circumstances of the case.&#10;&quot;It was a regular plan between that scoundrel and her,&quot; he said.  &quot;The&#10;bailiffs were put upon me; I was taken as I was going out of his house;&#10;when I wrote to her for money, she said she was ill in bed and put me&#10;off to another day. And when I got home I found her in diamonds and&#10;sitting with that villain alone.&quot; He then went on to describe hurriedly&#10;the personal conflict with Lord Steyne.  To an affair of that nature,&#10;of course, he said, there was but one issue, and after his conference&#10;with his brother, he was going away to make the necessary arrangements&#10;for the meeting which must ensue.  &quot;And as it may end fatally with me,&quot;&#10;Rawdon said with a broken voice, &quot;and as the boy has no mother, I must&#10;leave him to you" />
    <node id="  Look here, Pitt--you know that I was to have&#10;had Miss Crawley's money.  I wasn't brought up like a younger brother,&#10;but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kep idle.  But for this&#10;I might have been quite a different man.  I didn't do my duty with the&#10;regiment so bad.  You know how I was thrown over about the money, and&#10;who got it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;After the sacrifices I have made, and the manner in which I have stood&#10;by you, I think this sort of reproach is useless,&quot; Sir Pitt said.&#10;&quot;Your marriage was your own doing, not mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's over now,&quot; said Rawdon.  &quot;That's over now.&quot; And the words were&#10;wrenched from him with a groan, which made his brother start.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good God!  is she dead?&quot; Sir Pitt said with a voice of genuine alarm&#10;and commiseration.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish I was,&quot; Rawdon replied.  &quot;If it wasn't for little Rawdon I'd&#10;have cut my throat this morning--and that damned villain's too.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt instantly guessed the truth and surmised" />
    <node id="Rawdon Crawley suspects his wife Becky of deceit based on two pieces of evidence. First, he has discovered that she has been concealing money from him for ten years. Second, she swore to him the previous night that she had received no money from Lord Steyne, but Rawdon has learned that this is not true.&#10;&#10;Despite his brother's efforts to reconcile them, Rawdon refuses to believe in Becky's innocence because he feels deeply betrayed by her actions. He believes that she has lied to him and deceived him, which has caused him great pain and anguish. Additionally, Rawdon is upset about the loss of Miss Crawley's fortune, which he feels he was entitled to receive as Becky's husband. This disappointment, combined with his suspicion of her infidelity, has led Rawdon to become disillusioned with their marriage and refuse to believe in Becky's innocence." />

He recapitulated the&#10;statements which Becky had made, pointed out the probabilities of their&#10;truth, and asserted his own firm belief in her innocence.&#10;&#10;But Rawdon would not hear of it.  &quot;She has kep money concealed from me&#10;these ten years,&quot; he said &quot;She swore, last night only, she had none&#10;from Steyne.

    <node id="1. Rawdon returns to his brother Pitt's home in a disheveled state after discovering his wife Becky's deceit and seeking revenge on Lord Steyne. He plans to leave his young son Rawdon in the care of his brother.&#10;2. Pitt tries to calm Rawdon and reconcile him with Becky, mentioning her claims of innocence and asserting his belief in her.&#10;3. However, Rawdon refuses to believe in Becky's innocence, citing her concealment of money from him for ten years and her lie about receiving money from Lord Steyne.&#10;4. Pitt expresses concern about the recent newspaper article implicating Becky in an affair with Lord Steyne, which has further damaged her reputation following Rawdon's arrest.&#10;5. Lady Jane, Pitt's wife, arrives unexpectedly and is outraged by Becky's presence in their home, having already heard about the scandal from their servants. She demands that Becky leave the house immediately.&#10;6. Becky pleads with Pitt to tell Lady Jane about her innocence, but Pitt fails to intervene effectively.&#10;7. Rawdon remains resolute in his decision to separate from Becky and mentions his plans for the last of her winnings, which he intends to use for their son's future education.&#10;8. The passage suggests that Rawdon is unable to focus on the newspaper article about his arrest due to his anxiety about Becky and Lord Steyne, as well as the mention of a &quot;flaming account&quot; of the Gaunt House festivities, which featured Becky prominently." />
    <node id="Georgy and his grandsire have a complex relationship due to their contrasting upbringings and personalities. Georgy, who was raised by his kind and humble mother, has become a well-rounded and assertive individual with a strong sense of self-worth. On the other hand, his grandsire is depicted as a coarse and pompous man who regrets his own neglected education and tries to impress Georgy with his (the grandsire's) newly acquired classical knowledge.&#10;&#10;Their interactions reveal the grandsire's lack of education in several ways:&#10;&#10;1. Knowledge limitations: The grandsire pretends to understand Georgy's studies, but often makes mistakes and reveals his ignorance. This creates a knowledge gap between them, with Georgy being more educated and perceptive.&#10;&#10;2. Pompous orations: The grandsire delivers pompous speeches about the necessity of classical education, which further highlights his lack of genuine understanding.&#10;&#10;3. Diminished respect: Georgy's quick wit and superior education make him lose respect for his grandsire over time, leading to a situation where Georgy starts commanding his grandsire and looking down upon him.&#10;&#10;These interactions show that despite the luxurious life Georgy now enjoys in his grandsire's mansion, he maintains a sense of self-worth and maturity that stems from his mother's influence. This contrasts with the grandsire's lack of education, respect, and genuine appreciation for Georgy's achievements, which negatively affects their relationship." />
    <node id="Rawdon Crawley changed his mind about accepting the benefits procured for him and his son by Lord Steyne due to the persuasion of his brother and Mr. Macmurdo, as well as his own concern about how it would appear if Lord Steyne thought that Crawley's fortune was made through his means. Additionally, Crawley had recently discovered his wife Becky's betrayal and her lies about receiving money from Lord Steyne, which further solidified his decision to reject any favors from his enemy. The final straw may have been the newspaper article reporting on Rawdon's arrest and implying that Becky was having an affair with Lord Steyne, adding fuel to Crawley's anxiety and making it difficult for him to accept benefits from his nemesis." />

He was induced, however, to acquiesce in these benefits by&#10;the entreaties of his brother and Macmurdo, but mainly by the latter,&#10;pointing out to him what a fury Steyne would be in to think that his&#10;enemy's fortune was made through his means.&#10;&#10;When the Marquis of Steyne came abroad after his accident, the Colonial&#10;Secretary bowed up to him and congratulated himself and the Service&#10;upon" />

He feels betrayed and plans to confront Lord Steyne, intending to leave his young son Rawdon in the care of his brother.&#10;2. His desire to harm someone, specifically Lord Steyne, is due to his belief that Lord Steyne was involved in a &quot;regular plan&quot; with Becky, which resulted in Rawdon's financial ruin and public humiliation.&#10;3.

    <node id="1. The confrontation between Becky and the servants, including Mr. Trotter, is a tense scene in which Becky tries to assert her authority and order them to remove a drunken man from her home. However, the footmen refuse to follow her commands and instead insist that they take orders only from Lady Jane Crawley. This highlights Becky's precarious position in society and shows that she does not have the same level of control or respect as her social betters.&#10;2. During the confrontation, Mr. Trotter reveals that Colonel Crawley has left and taken his belongings with him. This development is likely to have further damaged Becky's reputation and increased her desperation as she seeks out Sir Pitt for help. The fact that the footmen are loyal to Lady Jane rather than to Becky also highlights the class dynamics at play and the challenges that Becky faces as a woman trying to navigate high society." />

We may be pretty certain that Mr. Rowson profited in his&#10;turn by his young master's liberality and gratitude for the pleasures&#10;to which the footman inducted him.&#10;&#10;A famous tailor from the West End of the town--Mr. Osborne would have&#10;none of your City or Holborn bunglers, he said, for the boy (though a&#10;City tailor was good enough for HIM)--was summoned to ornament little&#10;George's person, and was told to spare no expense in so doing.

    <node id="The speaker in the narrative is Mr. Veal, a teacher at the school that George Osborne attends. In this passage, he is recounting his experiences as a guest at Mr. Osborne's home and comparing it to the hospitality he has received from more noble figures. He mentions that Mr. Osborne's hospitality is &quot;to the full as richly served&quot; and his reception &quot;as gratifying and noble&quot; as any he has experienced, even when dining with nobles such as the Earl of Bareacres. This suggests that Mr. Osborne is a generous and welcoming host who treats his guests well.

One was fat,&#10;with mustachios, and the other was lean and long, in a blue frock-coat,&#10;with a brown face and a grizzled head.&#10;&#10;&quot;My God, how like he is!&quot; said the long gentleman with a start. &quot;Can&#10;you guess who we are, George?&quot;&#10;&#10;The boy's face flushed up, as it did usually when he was moved, and his&#10;eyes brightened.  &quot;I don't know the other,&quot; he said, &quot;but I should&#10;think you" />
    <node id="The Todd family is a lower-class family that includes Master Todd, who is friends with George Osborne. They live in Coram Street, while the Osborne family resides in Russell Square, which is considered a more noble and prosperous area. Despite their social differences, the Todds have a close relationship with the Osbornes due to Mr. Osborne's advancement of Todd from clerk to junior partner in his establishment. Additionally, George Osborne's wealthy grandfather has acted as a godfather to Master Todd and provides him with luxuries such as a handsomely groomed pony and riding lessons.&#10;&#10;The Todds have received hospitality from the Osborne family on several occasions, with Miss Osborne even driving them in her carriage and assisting Mrs. Todd with preparations for grand dinner parties at the Square. Maria Todd, who is presumably Master Todd's sister, assists with playing duets and singing during these gatherings.&#10;&#10;The professor mentioned in the passage has given the young gentlemen of the Todd family &quot;little eighteen-penny books&quot; with &quot;Athene&quot; engraved on them and a Latin inscription, which suggests that they may be attending school or receiving some form of education.

They both had a taste for painting&#10;theatrical characters; for hardbake and raspberry tarts; for sliding&#10;and skating in the Regent's Park and the Serpentine, when the weather&#10;permitted; for going to the play, whither they were often conducted, by&#10;Mr. Osborne's orders, by Rowson, Master George's appointed&#10;body-servant, with whom they sat in great comfort in the pit.&#10;&#10;In the company of this gentleman they visited all the principal&#10;theatres of the metropolis; knew the names of all the actors from Drury&#10;Lane to Sadler's Wells; and performed, indeed, many of the plays to the&#10;Todd family and their youthful friends, with West's famous characters,&#10;" />

They were hesitant to take Lord Steyne's money because they did not want to be indebted to him or tainted by his influence.

Additionally, Rawdon is upset about the loss of Miss Crawley's fortune, which he feels he was entitled to receive as Becky's husband. This disappointment, combined with his suspicion of her infidelity, has led Rawdon to become disillusioned with their marriage and refuse to believe in Becky's innocence.">

The passage suggests that Rawdon is unable to focus on the newspaper article about his arrest due to his anxiety about Becky and Lord Steyne, as well as the mention of a &quot;flaming account&quot; of the Gaunt House festivities, which featured Becky prominently.">

According to Lady Jane, Becky is a wicked woman who brings misery wherever she goes. She accuses Becky of being a heartless mother and a false wife, and claims that she has deceived everyone with her wicked flattery and falsehoods.&#10;2. Lady Jane also believes that Becky's soul is black with vanity, worldliness, and all sorts of crime, and that she is not worthy to sit down with Christian people. She is so opposed to having Becky in her home that she threatens to leave with her children if Sir Pitt allows Becky to stay.&#10;3. Lady Jane's reasons for keeping her children away from Becky are based on her belief that Becky is a bad influence and a danger to her family. She claims that Becky has deceived her husband and everyone else, and that she cannot be trusted.&#10;4.

These qualities shaped him into a more respectable and well-rounded individual than his grandfather's plans might have achieved.&#10;2. This upbringing also made Georgy more assertive and imperious, allowing him to adapt well to his new life in his grandfather's mansion. He became more mature for his age, sitting in the dining room after breakfast and reading the Morning Post like a grown-up man. The servants observed how much Georgy resembled his father in appearance and behavior, which delighted them.&#10;3. Georgy's kind upbringing influenced his interactions with his pompous grandfather by enabling him to win over his grandsire with his good looks, gallant bearing, and gentlemanly appearance. His grandfather became proud of him, just as he was of Georgy's father. This shared resemblance helped build a fond relationship between the two.&#10;4. In summary, Georgy's upbringing contributed to his behavior and self-perception by making him more assertive, mature, and gentlemanly. It also positively affected his relationship with his grandfather by allowing them to bond over their resemblance and shared qualities.">

On the other hand, his grandsire is depicted as a coarse and pompous man who regrets his own neglected education and tries to impress Georgy with his (the grandsire's) newly acquired classical knowledge.&#10;&#10;Their interactions reveal the grandsire's lack of education in several ways:&#10;&#10;1. Knowledge limitations: The grandsire pretends to understand Georgy's studies, but often makes mistakes and reveals his ignorance. This creates a knowledge gap between them, with Georgy being more educated and perceptive.&#10;&#10;2. Pompous orations: The grandsire delivers pompous speeches about the necessity of classical education, which further highlights his lack of genuine understanding.&#10;&#10;3. Diminished respect: Georgy's quick wit and superior education make him lose respect for his grandsire over time, leading to a situation where Georgy starts commanding his grandsire and looking down upon him.&#10;&#10;These interactions show that despite the luxurious life Georgy now enjoys in his grandsire's mansion, he maintains a sense of self-worth and maturity that stems from his mother's influence. This contrasts with the grandsire's lack of education, respect, and genuine appreciation for Georgy's achievements, which negatively affects their relationship.">

According to Lady Jane, Becky is a wicked woman who brings misery wherever she goes. She accuses Becky of being a heartless mother and a false wife, and claims that she has deceived everyone with her wicked flattery and falsehoods.&#10;2. Lady Jane also believes that Becky's soul is black with vanity, worldliness, and all sorts of crime, and that she is not worthy to sit down with Christian people. She is so opposed to having Becky in her home that she threatens to leave with her children if Sir Pitt allows Becky to stay.&#10;3.

Pompous orations: The grandsire delivers pompous speeches about the necessity of classical education, which further highlights his lack of genuine understanding.&#10;&#10;3.

Georgy, who was raised by his kind and humble mother, has become a well-rounded and assertive individual with a strong sense of self-worth. On the other hand, his grandsire is depicted as a coarse and pompous man who regrets his own neglected education and tries to impress Georgy with his (the grandsire's) newly acquired classical knowledge.&#10;&#10;Their interactions reveal the grandsire's lack of education in several ways:&#10;&#10;1. Knowledge limitations: The grandsire pretends to understand Georgy's studies, but often makes mistakes and reveals his ignorance. This creates a knowledge gap between them, with Georgy being more educated and perceptive.&#10;&#10;2. Pompous orations: The grandsire delivers pompous speeches about the necessity of classical education, which further highlights his lack of genuine understanding.&#10;&#10;3. Diminished respect: Georgy's quick wit and superior education make him lose respect for his grandsire over time, leading to a situation where Georgy starts commanding his grandsire and looking down upon him.&#10;&#10;These interactions show that despite the luxurious life Georgy now enjoys in his grandsire's mansion, he maintains a sense of self-worth and maturity that stems from his mother's influence. This contrasts with the grandsire's lack of education, respect, and genuine appreciation for Georgy's achievements, which negatively affects their relationship.">

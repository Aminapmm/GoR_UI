    <node id="The mysterious taint of the blood refers to a hereditary disease or mental illness that has affected the proud race, causing the poor invalid in Vanity Fair to exhibit strange behaviors. This condition has been passed down from the poor mother's ancient race and has also affected the father's family. The illness is suggested to be the reason for the invalid's erratic behavior, such as his fixation on having strong wine-and-water, forgetting about his wife and children, and other bizarre actions like playing with a child's toy or nursing a doll." />

Sometimes he laughed at her&#10;(and his laughter was more pitiful than to hear him cry); sometimes she&#10;found the brilliant dandy diplomatist of the Congress of Vienna&#10;dragging about a child's toy, or nursing the keeper's baby's doll.&#10;Sometimes he knew her and Father Mole, her director and companion;&#10;oftener he forgot her, as he had done wife, children, love, ambition,&#10;vanity.  But he remembered his dinner-hour, and used to cry if his&#10;wine-and-water was not strong enough.&#10;&#10;It was the mysterious taint of the blood; the poor mother had brought&#10;it from her own ancient race.  The evil had broken out once or twice in&#10;the father's family, long before Lady Steyne's sins had begun, or her&#10;fasts and tears and penances had been offered in their expiation.

THE KING? There he was. Beefeaters were&#10;before the august box; the Marquis of Steyne (Lord of the Powder&#10;Closet) and other great officers of state were behind the chair on&#10;which he sat, HE sat--florid of face, portly of person, covered with&#10;orders, and in a rich curling head of hair--how we sang God save him!&#10;How the house rocked and shouted with that magnificent music.

First they talked of&#10;their father and devised plans against his return.  Then the name of&#10;the living dead man was less frequently in their mouth--then not&#10;mentioned at all.  But the stricken old grandmother trembled to think&#10;that these too were the inheritors of their father's shame as well as&#10;of his honours, and watched sickening for the day when the awful&#10;ancestral curse should come down on them.&#10;&#10;This dark presentiment also haunted Lord Steyne.  He tried to lay the&#10;horrid bedside ghost in Red Seas of wine and jollity, and lost sight of&#10;it sometimes in the crowd and rout of his pleasures.

The Irish maidservant has not altered&#10;in the least in her kind and respectful behaviour; but Mrs. Sedley&#10;fancies that she is growing insolent and ungrateful, and, as the guilty&#10;thief who fears each bush an officer, sees threatening innuendoes and&#10;hints of capture in all the girl's speeches and answers." />

    <node id="The Caerlyons, also known as the Marquises of Camelot, are an ancient and renowned noble family with a significant history. Their eldest son holds the title Pendragon. Members of this family have been involved in various historical events, including loyal conspiracies and supporting Mary during her confinement. They have preserved the old faith since the conversion of their first ancestor, a venerable Druid.&#10;&#10;The family's pedigree goes far beyond the arrival of King Brute in the islands. The Caerlyons have participated in many loyal conspiracies throughout history. During Mary's confinement, they conspired in her favor, and during Elizabeth's reign, they were fined and had their properties confiscated for harboring priests, obstinate recusancy, and popish misdoings.&#10;&#10;A cadet of the house was an officer of the great Duke and distinguished himself in the famous Saint Bartholomew conspiracy. The family was also injured by its charges in fitting out an armament against the Spaniards during the time of the Armada. During James's time, a recusant of the family was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of a great theologian, leading to some restoration of the family's fortunes. However, the Earl of Camelot, of the reign of Charles, returned to the old creed of his family and continued to fight for it, ruining themselves for it as long as there was a Stuart left to head or instigate a rebellion.&#10;&#10;Lady Mary Caerlyon, brought up at a Parisian convent, was married to Lord Gaunt, who won vast sums from her brother at some of Philip of Orleans's banquets. The family possessed castles and palaces in various quarters of the three kingdoms, such as Castle Strongbow, Gaunt Castle, Gauntly Hall, and Stillbrook in Hampshire, which was my lord's farm and had wonderful furniture sold at his demise by a late celebrated auctioneer.&#10;&#10;Becky Sharp, a central character in the narrative, highly regards the names of the Marchioness of Steyne and the Countess of Gaunt on her visiting cards, pushing other cards to the bottom of the pack as these are court cards from the noble families of Bareacres and Caerlyon. She and Briggs likely looked up their family trees in the Peerage with excitement." />

Pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house.&#10;The sons have been called Arthurs, Uthers, and Caradocs, from&#10;immemorial time. Their heads have fallen in many a loyal conspiracy.&#10;Elizabeth chopped off the head of the Arthur of her day, who had been&#10;Chamberlain to Philip and Mary, and carried letters between the Queen&#10;of Scots and her uncles the Guises.  A cadet of the house was an&#10;officer of the great Duke and distinguished in the famous Saint&#10;Bartholomew conspiracy.  During the whole of Mary's confinement, the&#10;house of Camelot conspired in her behalf.

A recreant of James's time was momentarily perverted from&#10;his religion by the arguments of that great theologian, and the&#10;fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his timely weakness.

Steyne!&#10;Bareacres, Johnes of Helvellyn!  and Caerylon of Camelot! we may be&#10;sure that Becky and Briggs looked out those august names in the&#10;Peerage, and followed the noble races up through all the ramifications&#10;of the family tree" />

Neither divine allowed himself to&#10;be conquered, and though the fond mother hoped that her youngest and&#10;favourite son would be reconciled to her church--his mother church--a&#10;sad and awful disappointment awaited the devout lady--a disappointment&#10;which seemed to be a judgement upon her for the sin of her marriage.&#10;&#10;My Lord Gaunt married, as every person who frequents the Peerage knows,&#10;the Lady Blanche Thistlewood, a daughter of the noble house of&#10;Bareacres, before mentioned in this veracious history.  A wing of Gaunt&#10;House was assigned to this couple; for the head of the family chose to&#10;govern it, and while he reigned to reign supreme; his son and heir,&#10;however, living little at home, disagreeing with his wife, and&#10;borrowing upon post-obits such moneys as he required beyond the very&#10;moderate sums which his father was disposed to allow him" />

Becky found them in old wardrobes and quietly took them home, using them for her own dress.

    <node id=" magnificence of the&#10;brocade of Becky's train, and the splendour of the lace on her dress.&#10;&#10;The brocade was an old remnant, Becky said; and as for the lace, it was&#10;a great bargain.  She had had it these hundred years.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear Mrs. Crawley, it must have cost a little fortune,&quot; Lady Jane&#10;said, looking down at her own lace, which was not nearly so good; and&#10;then examining the quality of the ancient brocade which formed the&#10;material of Mrs. Rawdon's Court dress, she felt inclined to say that&#10;she could not afford such fine clothing, but checked that speech, with&#10;an effort, as one uncharitable to her kinswoman.&#10;&#10;And yet, if Lady Jane had known all, I think even her kindly temper&#10;would have failed her.  The fact is, when she was putting Sir Pitt's&#10;house in order, Mrs. Rawdon had found the lace and the brocade in old&#10;wardrobes, the property of the former ladies of the house, and had&#10;quietly carried the goods home, and had suited them to her own little&#10;person.

A score of years hence that&#10;too, that milliner's wonder, will have passed into the domain of the&#10;absurd, along with all previous vanities.  But we are wandering too&#10;much.  Mrs. Rawdon's dress was pronounced to be charmante on the&#10;eventful day of her presentation. Even good little Lady Jane was forced&#10;to acknowledge this effect, as she looked at her kinswoman, and owned&#10;sorrowfully to herself that she was quite inferior in taste to Mrs.&#10;Becky.&#10;&#10;She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Rawdon had&#10;bestowed upon that garment.  Rebecca had as good taste as any milliner&#10;in Europe, and such a clever way of doing things as Lady Jane little&#10;understood. The latter quickly spied out the magnificence of the&#10;brocade of Becky's train, and the splendour of the lace on her dress.&#10;&#10;The brocade was an old" />

The fact is that Lord Steyne had once purchased a&#10;couple of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could&#10;never forget her gratitude for that favour.&#10;&#10;The Lady Bareacres then came under Becky's cognizance--to whom the&#10;Colonel's lady made also a most respectful obeisance:  it was returned&#10;with severe dignity by the exalted person in question.&#10;&#10;&quot;I had the pleasure of making your Ladyship's acquaintance at Brussels,&#10;ten years ago,&quot; Becky said in the most winning manner.  &quot;I had the good&#10;fortune to meet Lady Bareacres at the Duchess of Richmond's ball, the&#10;night before the Battle of Waterloo.  And I recollect your Ladyship,&#10;and my Lady Blanche, your daughter, sitting in the carriage in the&#10;porte-cochere at the Inn, waiting for horses. I hope your Ladyship's&#10;diamonds are safe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Everybody's eyes looked into their neighbour's.  The famous diamonds&#10;had undergone a famous seizure, it appears, about which Becky, of&#10;course, knew nothing. Rawdon Crawley retreated with Lord Southdown into&#10;a window" />
    <node id=" to make a single remark except&#10;to state that the weather was very hot.  Indeed Becky would have left&#10;him at home, but that virtue ordained that her husband should be by her&#10;side to protect the timid and fluttering little creature on her first&#10;appearance in polite society.&#10;&#10;On her first appearance Lord Steyne stepped forward, taking her hand,&#10;and greeting her with great courtesy, and presenting her to Lady&#10;Steyne, and their ladyships, her daughters.  Their ladyships made three&#10;stately curtsies, and the elder lady to be sure gave her hand to the&#10;newcomer, but it was as cold and lifeless as marble.&#10;&#10;Becky took it, however, with grateful humility, and performing a&#10;reverence which would have done credit to the best dancer-master, put&#10;herself at Lady Steyne's feet, as it were, by saying that his Lordship&#10;had been her father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Becky,&#10;had learned to honour and respect the Steyne family from the days of&#10;her childhood.

He was to have followed the&#10;procession and waited upon his sovereign in a cab, but that his&#10;good-natured sister-in-law insisted that they should be a family party.&#10;The coach was large, the ladies not very big, they would hold their&#10;trains in their laps--finally, the four went fraternally together, and&#10;their carriage presently joined the line of royal equipages which was&#10;making its way down Piccadilly and St.  James's Street, towards the old&#10;brick palace where the Star of Brunswick was in waiting to receive his&#10;nobles and gentlefolks.&#10;&#10;Becky felt as if she could bless the people out of the carriage&#10;windows, so elated was she in spirit, and so strong a sense had she of&#10;the dignified position which she had at last attained in" />

Additionally, Becky is considering paying off other debts and doing kind gestures such as giving money to her former servant, Briggs, in order to present herself as a woman of means and respectability in polite society." />
    <node id="she sat at work, and sitting down to the piano, she rattled away a&#10;triumphant voluntary on the keys, which made the people pause under her&#10;window to listen to her brilliant music.&#10;&#10;That night, there came two notes from Gaunt House for the little woman,&#10;the one containing a card of invitation from Lord and Lady Steyne to a&#10;dinner at Gaunt House next Friday, while the other enclosed a slip of&#10;gray paper bearing Lord Steyne's signature and the address of Messrs.&#10;Jones, Brown, and Robinson, Lombard Street.&#10;&#10;Rawdon heard Becky laughing in the night once or twice.  It was only&#10;her delight at going to Gaunt House and facing the ladies there, she&#10;said, which amused her so.  But the truth was that she was occupied&#10;with a great number of other thoughts.  Should she pay off old Briggs&#10;and give her her conge? Should she astonish Raggles by settling his&#10;account? She turned over all these thoughts on her pillow, and on the&#10;next day, when Rawdon went out to pay his morning visit to the Club,&#10;Mrs. Crawley (in a modest dress with a veil on) whipped off" />
    <node id=" poor little&#10;Becky, alone with the ladies, went up to the fire-place whither the&#10;great ladies had repaired, the great ladies marched away and took&#10;possession of a table of drawings.  When Becky followed them to the&#10;table of drawings, they dropped off one by one to the fire again.  She&#10;tried to speak to one of the children (of whom she was commonly fond in&#10;public places), but Master George Gaunt was called away by his mamma;&#10;and the stranger was treated with such cruelty finally, that even Lady&#10;Steyne herself pitied her and went up to speak to the friendless little&#10;woman.&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord Steyne,&quot; said her Ladyship, as her wan cheeks glowed with a&#10;blush, &quot;says you sing and play very beautifully, Mrs. Crawley--I wish&#10;you would do me the kindness to sing to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will do anything that may give pleasure to my Lord Steyne or to&#10;you,&quot; said Rebecca, sincerely grateful, and seating herself at the&#10;piano, began to sing.&#10;&#10;She sang religious songs of Mozart, which had been early favourites of&#10;Lady Steyne, and with" />
    <node id="I can't send her away,&quot; Becky said presently, after a pause, and in a&#10;very sad voice.  Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke, and she&#10;turned away her head.&#10;&#10;&quot;You owe her her wages, I suppose?&quot; said the Peer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Worse than that,&quot; said Becky, still casting down her eyes; &quot;I have&#10;ruined her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ruined her? Then why don't you turn her out?&quot; the gentleman asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Men do that,&quot; Becky answered bitterly.  &quot;Women are not so bad as you.&#10;Last year, when we were reduced to our last guinea, she gave us&#10;everything.  She shall never leave me, until we are ruined utterly&#10;ourselves, which does not seem far off, or until I can pay her the&#10;utmost farthing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;------ it, how much is it?&quot; said the Peer with an oath. And Becky,&#10;reflecting on the largeness of his means, mentioned not only the sum&#10;which she had borrowed from Miss Briggs, but one of nearly double the&#10;amount.&#10;&#10;This caused the Lord Steyne to break out in another brief and energetic&#10;expression of anger, at" />

    <node id="The narrative suggests that Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's audience with the &quot;First Gentleman in Europe&quot; (an honorary title for the Prince Regent, who later became King George IV) is intended to quell any doubts about her virtue and reputation.

This is further emphasized when the narrator expresses &quot;love and awe&quot; for this historical figure, highlighting the significance of his endorsement.

    <node id="The ominous consequence that both the absent lord's children and Lord Steyne fear is the &quot;awful ancestral curse&quot; that may come down on them as inheritors of the father's shame as well as his honors. This fear is rooted in the &quot;dark mark of fate and doom&quot; that has befallen their family, symbolized by the first-born of Pharaoh being struck down.&#10;&#10;The absent lord's children initially talk about their father and devise plans against his return. However, they gradually stop mentioning him altogether. The stricken old grandmother trembles at the thought of the curse befalling them, while Lord Steyne tries to escape the &quot;horrid bedside ghost&quot; in Red Seas of wine and jollity, losing sight of it sometimes in the crowd and rout of his pleasures. However, it always comes back to him when alone, seeming to grow more threatening with years.&#10;&#10;To cope with this looming threat, Becky Crawley, now Lady Steyne, considers paying off old debts and doing kind gestures such as giving money to her former servant, Briggs, in order to present herself as a woman of means and respectability in polite society.

This event is significant because it showcases Becky's confidence and boldness in high-society settings.

This act angered her mother, Mrs. Sedley, who believed the money should have been used to pay off debts or provide for Mr. Sedley.&#10;&#10;Amelia also tried to find ways to increase their small income by giving lessons, painting card-racks, or doing fine work. However, their situation worsened when her father's shares did not rise as he had hoped, and they fell deeper into debt. The butcher and grocer became surly and insolent, and Amelia had to purchase items for Georgy's health using her own money.&#10;&#10;When she received her dividend, she decided to keep a portion back, having already contracted engagements for a new suit for Georgy. However, when she found out that Jos's remittances were not being paid, she gave all her money to her mother without hesitation. She also had to break the news to Georgy that he would not be receiving new clothes for Christmas, which led to his disappointment and loud outcry. Amelia handled this by explaining their financial situation to him and emphasizing that everyone else in the family was making sacrifices too.

For the Baronet and his daughters, there was an additional incentive to attend the dinner: their connection to Lady Jane and their desire to rise in society. Attending Lord Steyne's gathering would provide them with a valuable opportunity to socialize with members of the higher echelons of society, potentially strengthening their ties to influential individuals and furthering their aspirations for upward mobility.&#10;&#10;3. In Becky's case, she was likely motivated by her need to secure her position in society as Mrs. Crawley, a task made more challenging by her lower-class background and lack of connections compared to the other guests at Lord Steyne's dinner party. She would have seen this gathering as an important opportunity to make a good impression on her husband's influential relatives and social acquaintances.&#10;&#10;4.

The Square also features a statue of Lord Gaunt, who fought at Minden, in a three-tailed wig and Roman Emperor-like attire. &#10;&#10;The surrounding buildings have an air of dowagerism, suggesting they are past their prime, and the laced lacqueys and link-boys of old times, who once put out their torches in the blank iron extinguishers that still flank the lamps over the steps, are gone.

This is why Lord Steyne threatens to have Rebecca's dog poisoned - he is angry and frustrated with her for not being able to repay her debts. Rebecca is also afraid to reveal the truth to her husband, as he would be very upset and may resort to violent measures.

At last he clapped his hat on his head and flung out&#10;of the room.  Rebecca did not rise from her attitude of misery until&#10;the door slammed upon him and his carriage whirled away.  Then she rose&#10;up with the queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in&#10;her green eyes.

Amelia was uneasy when George spent time with his extended family because she was protective of him and anxious about his well-being. She may also have been wary of further entanglements with the Osborne family, given their strained relationship and her own difficult financial situation.

She feels sadness and worry about their impending separation, but tries to convince herself that this is a good opportunity for her son to have new experiences and enjoyments in the world. Amelia justifies George's behavior by blaming herself and seeing his new experiences as a form of ambition that she has denied him in the past. She also feels pride and emotion when she sees him attending church and giving charity, indicating that she takes comfort in his presence even from a distance.&#10;&#10;Despite her own feelings of abandonment and sadness, Amelia focuses on her love for her child and tries to do what is best for him. However, this comes at a cost to her own emotional well-being, as she feels a &quot;timorous debasement and self-humiliation&quot; in accepting the situation and taking all the blame upon herself. This portrayal of a mother's complex emotions reflects the narrator's observation that &quot;it is those who injure women who get the most kindness from them--they are born timid and tyrants and maltreat those who are humblest before them.&quot;&#10;&#10;In short, Amelia experiences a range of conflicting emotions as she copes with her son's departure, including sadness, worry, pride, and love. She tries to reconcile these feelings by focusing on her love for her child and taking comfort in his presence even from a distance, but ultimately feels a sense of debasement and self-humiliation in accepting the situation and taking all the blame upon herself." />

Amelia was uneasy when George spent time with his extended family because she was protective of him and anxious about his well-being. She may also have been wary of further entanglements with the Osborne family, given their strained relationship and her own difficult financial situation. Additionally, she may have felt that these visits were a reminder of her deceased husband and the life she could have had with him, leading to feelings of sadness and loss.">

How she owns that it is she and not the&#10;man who is guilty; how she takes all the faults on her side; how she&#10;courts in a manner punishment for the wrongs which she has not&#10;committed and persists in shielding the real culprit!  It is those who&#10;injure women who get the most kindness from them--they are born timid&#10;and tyrants and maltreat those who are humblest before them.&#10;&#10;So poor Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her son's&#10;departure, and had passed many and many a long solitary hour in making&#10;preparations for the end. George stood by his mother, watching her&#10;arrangements without the least concern.  Tears had fallen into his&#10;boxes; passages had been scored in his favourite books; old toys,&#10;relics, treasures had been hoarded away for him, and packed with&#10;strange neatness and care--and of all these things the boy took no&#10;note.  The child goes away smiling as the mother breaks her heart." target="The mother, Amelia, experiences a range of emotions as she copes with her son George's eagerness to live with his wealthy grandfather. She feels sadness and worry about their impending separation, but tries to convince herself that this is a good opportunity for her son to have new experiences and enjoyments in the world. Amelia justifies George's behavior by blaming herself and seeing his new experiences as a form of ambition that she has denied him in the past. She also feels pride and emotion when she sees him attending church and giving charity, indicating that she takes comfort in his presence even from a distance.&#10;&#10;Despite her own feelings of abandonment and sadness, Amelia focuses on her love for her child and tries to do what is best for him. However, this comes at a cost to her own emotional well-being, as she feels a &quot;timorous debasement and self-humiliation&quot; in accepting the situation and taking all the blame upon herself. This portrayal of a mother's complex emotions reflects the narrator's observation that &quot;it is those who injure women who get the most kindness from them--they are born timid and tyrants and maltreat those who are humblest before them.&quot;&#10;&#10;In short, Amelia experiences a range of conflicting emotions as she copes with her son's departure, including sadness, worry, pride, and love. She tries to reconcile these feelings by focusing on her love for her child and taking comfort in his presence even from a distance, but ultimately feels a sense of debasement and self-humiliation in accepting the situation and taking all the blame upon herself.">

If Mrs. George&#10;Osborne proposed to marry again, as Mr. O.  heard was her intention, he&#10;would not withdraw that allowance. But it must be understood that the&#10;child would live entirely with his grandfather in Russell Square, or at&#10;whatever other place Mr. O. should select, and that he would be&#10;occasionally permitted to see Mrs. George Osborne at her own residence.&#10;This message was brought or read to her in a letter one day, when her&#10;mother was from home and her father absent as usual in the City.&#10;&#10;She was never seen angry but twice or thrice in her life, and it was in&#10;one of these moods that Mr. Osborne's attorney had the fortune to&#10;behold her.

Additionally, this decision might also indicate that Mr. Osborne has realized the importance of family and is trying to make amends by providing a home for his grandson.">

She feels sadness and worry about their impending separation, but tries to convince herself that this is a good opportunity for her son to have new experiences and enjoyments in the world. Amelia justifies George's behavior by blaming herself and seeing his new experiences as a form of ambition that she has denied him in the past. She also feels pride and emotion when she sees him attending church and giving charity, indicating that she takes comfort in his presence even from a distance.&#10;&#10;Despite her own feelings of abandonment and sadness, Amelia focuses on her love for her child and tries to do what is best for him. However, this comes at a cost to her own emotional well-being, as she feels a &quot;timorous debasement and self-humiliation&quot; in accepting the situation and taking all the blame upon herself. This portrayal of a mother's complex emotions reflects the narrator's observation that &quot;it is those who injure women who get the most kindness from them--they are born timid and tyrants and maltreat those who are humblest before them.&quot;&#10;&#10;In short, Amelia experiences a range of conflicting emotions as she copes with her son's departure, including sadness, worry, pride, and love. She tries to reconcile these feelings by focusing on her love for her child and taking comfort in his presence even from a distance, but ultimately feels a sense of debasement and self-humiliation in accepting the situation and taking all the blame upon herself.">

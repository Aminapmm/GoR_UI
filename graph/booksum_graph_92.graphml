    <node id="1. Carol initially refuses to believe that medicine can be turned into a penny-picking business because she has a idealistic view of the profession as a priesthood of healing, dedicated to helping people rather than focusing on profit. This is in line with her character as an idealistic reformer who wants to improve Gopher Prairie.&#10;2. Kennicott's behavior towards the Widow Bogart influences Carol's view because it suggests that he may have previously hinted at her to be nice to the widow for personal gain, implying that he might be willing to compromise his medical practice for financial benefit. This would go against Carol's idealistic beliefs and cause her to question the true motivations of some professionals in Gopher Prairie." />

She flinched, looked at Guy beseechingly.&#10;&#10;He sprang up, strode to her with a nervous step, smoothed her hand. She&#10;wondered if she ought to be offended by his caress. Then she wondered if&#10;he liked her hat, the new Oriental turban of rose and silver brocade.&#10;&#10;He dropped her hand. His elbow brushed her shoulder. He flitted over to&#10;the desk-chair" />
    <node id="III&#10;&#10;&#10;Carol had started a salon.&#10;&#10;Since Kennicott, Vida Sherwin, and Guy Pollock were her only lions,&#10;and since Kennicott would have preferred Sam Clark to all the poets and&#10;radicals in the entire world, her private and self-defensive clique did&#10;not get beyond one evening dinner for Vida and Guy, on her first wedding&#10;anniversary; and that dinner did not get beyond a controversy regarding&#10;Raymie Wutherspoon's yearnings.&#10;&#10;Guy Pollock was the gentlest person she had found here. He spoke of her&#10;new jade and cream frock naturally, not jocosely; he held her chair&#10;for her as they sat down to dinner; and he did not, like Kennicott,&#10;interrupt her to shout, &quot;Oh say, speaking of that, I heard a good story&#10;today.&quot; But Guy was incurably hermit. He sat late and talked hard, and&#10;did not come again.&#10;&#10;Then she met Champ Perry in the post-office--and decided that in the&#10;history of the pioneers was the panacea for Gopher Prairie, for all&#10;of America.

Not in twenty&#10;years would the council propose or Gopher Prairie vote the funds for a&#10;new city hall.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;V&#10;&#10;&#10;Carol had avoided exposing her plans to Vida Sherwin. She was shy of the&#10;big-sister manner; Vida would either laugh at her or snatch the idea and&#10;change it to suit herself. But there was no other hope. When Vida came&#10;in to tea Carol sketched her Utopia.&#10;&#10;Vida was soothing but decisive:&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear, you're all off. I would like to see it: a real gardeny place&#10;to shut out the gales. But it can't be done. What could the clubwomen&#10;accomplish?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Their husbands are the most important men in town.

    <node id=", we're not so slow!&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Luke Dawson, wife of the richest man in town, gaped at them&#10;piteously when they appeared. Her expensive frock of beaver-colored&#10;satin with rows, plasters, and pendants of solemn brown beads was&#10;intended for a woman twice her size. She stood wringing her hands in&#10;front of nineteen folding chairs, in her front parlor with its faded&#10;photograph of Minnehaha Falls in 1890, its &quot;colored enlargement&quot; of&#10;Mr. Dawson, its bulbous lamp painted with sepia cows and mountains and&#10;standing on a mortuary marble column.&#10;&#10;She creaked, &quot;O Mrs. Kennicott, I'm in such a fix. I'm supposed to lead&#10;the discussion, and I wondered would you come and help?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What poet do you take up today?&quot; demanded Carol, in her library tone of&#10;&quot;What book do you wish to take out?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, the English ones.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not all of them?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;W-why yes.

Vida would not; Kennicott could not.&#10;&#10;Some one to share her refuge.&#10;&#10;Suddenly she was thinking of Guy Pollock.&#10;&#10;She dismissed him. He was too cautious. She needed a spirit as young and&#10;unreasonable as her own. And she would never find it. Youth would never&#10;come singing. She was beaten.&#10;&#10;Yet that same evening she had an idea which solved the rebuilding of&#10;Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Within ten minutes she was jerking the old-fashioned bell-pull of Luke&#10;Dawson. Mrs. Dawson opened the door and peered doubtfully about the&#10;edge of it. Carol kissed her cheek, and frisked into the lugubrious&#10;sitting-room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well, you're a sight for sore eyes!&quot; chuckled Mr. Dawson,&#10;dropping his newspaper, pushing his spectacles back on his forehead.&#10;&#10;&quot;You seem so excited,&quot; sighed Mrs. Dawson.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am! Mr. Dawson, aren't you a millionaire?&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" thoughts, Mrs.&#10;Kennicott. Of course I have never READ Swinburne, but years ago, when&#10;he was in vogue, I remember Mr. Warren saying that Swinburne (or was&#10;it Oscar Wilde? but anyway:) he said that though many so-called&#10;intellectual people posed and pretended to find beauty in Swinburne,&#10;there can never be genuine beauty without the message from the heart.&#10;But at the same time I do think you have an excellent idea, and though&#10;we have talked about Furnishings and China as the probable subject for&#10;next year, I believe that it would be nice if the program committee&#10;would try to work in another day entirely devoted to English poetry! In&#10;fact, Madame Chairman, I so move you.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Mrs. Dawson's coffee and angel's-food had helped them to recover&#10;from the depression caused by thoughts of Shakespeare's death they all&#10;told Carol that it was a pleasure to have her with them. The membership&#10;committee retired to the sitting-room for three minutes and elected her&#10;a member.&#10;&#10;And she stopped being patronizing.&#10;&#10;She wanted to be one of them. They were so loyal and kind" />

    <node id=" Sunday Schools?&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Leonard Warren, somewhat out of order but much more out of temper,&#10;cried, &quot;Well upon my word! I didn't suppose there was any one who felt&#10;that we could get enough of the Bible! I guess if the Grand Old Book&#10;has withstood the attacks of infidels for these two thousand years it is&#10;worth our SLIGHT consideration!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I didn't mean----&quot; Carol begged. Inasmuch as she did mean, it was&#10;hard to be extremely lucid. &quot;But I wish, instead of limiting ourselves&#10;either to the Bible, or to anecdotes about the Brothers Adam's wigs,&#10;which Culture Hints seems to regard as the significant point about&#10;furniture, we could study some of the really stirring ideas that are&#10;springing up today--whether it's chemistry or anthropology or labor&#10;problems--the things that are going to mean so terribly much.&quot;&#10;&#10;Everybody cleared her polite throat.&#10;&#10;Madam Chairman inquired, &quot;Is there any other discussion?

She glanced uneasily at Miss&#10;Sherwin. &quot;But what do you think, Vida?&quot;&#10;&#10;Vida smiled tactfully at each of the committee, and announced, &quot;Well, I&#10;don't believe we'd better start anything more right now. But it's been&#10;a privilege to hear Carol's dear generous ideas, hasn't it! Oh! There is&#10;one thing we must decide on at once.

Mrs.&#10;Dawson is going to be leader and the poor soul is frightened to death.&#10;She wanted me to get you to come.

Her chair was out in the open, exposed to their&#10;gaze, and it was a hard-slatted, quivery, slippery church-parlor chair,&#10;likely to collapse publicly and without warning. It was impossible to&#10;sit on it without folding the hands and listening piously.&#10;&#10;She wanted to kick the chair and run. It would make a magnificent&#10;clatter.&#10;&#10;She saw that Vida Sherwin was watching her. She pinched her wrist, as&#10;though she were a noisy child in church, and when she was decent and&#10;cramped again, she listened.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dawson opened the meeting by sighing, &quot;I'm sure I'm glad to see you&#10;all here today, and I understand that the ladies have prepared a number&#10;of very interesting papers, this is such an interesting subject, the&#10;poets, they have been an inspiration for higher thought, in fact wasn't&#10;it Reverend Benlick who said that some of the poets have been as much an" />

To find one of the &quot;young folks&quot; who&#10;took them seriously, heartened the Perrys, and she easily drew from&#10;them the principles by which Gopher Prairie should be born again--should&#10;again become amusing to live in.&#10;&#10;This was their philosophy complete . . . in the era of aeroplanes and&#10;syndicalism:&#10;&#10;The Baptist Church (and, somewhat less, the Methodist, Congregational,&#10;and Presbyterian Churches) is the perfect, the divinely ordained&#10;standard in music, oratory, philanthropy, and ethics. &quot;We don't need&#10;all this new-f" />

    <node id="The history of the pioneers in Gopher Prairie, as described by Mrs. Champ Perry, suggests that they possessed certain virtues such as sturdiness and integrity which are considered lost in the present time. These early settlers were Maine Yankees who built their own log stockade for defense against the Sioux. They were self-sufficient, growing their own corn, shooting ducks, pigeons, and prairie chickens, and making use of wild plums and crab-apples as treats. Despite their difficult circumstances, they took pride in their homes, making the best of their limited resources by repairing and decorating their furniture with care.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Perry believes that these values can be restored by returning veterans to power and following their &quot;backward path.&quot; This suggests that the pioneers' way of life was characterized by a sense of community, hard work, and self-sufficiency, which has been lost in the modern era. The present-day citizens of Gopher Prairie, including Carol Kennicott, are encouraged to look to the past as a model for restoring these virtues to their own lives and creating a more integrated and fulfilling society." />

The log stockade which Mrs. Champ&#10;Perry was to find when she trekked in was built afterward by the&#10;soldiers as a defense against the Sioux. The four cabins were inhabited&#10;by Maine Yankees who had come up the Mississippi to St. Paul and driven&#10;north over virgin prairie into virgin woods. They ground their own&#10;corn; the men-folks shot ducks and pigeons and prairie chickens; the&#10;new breakings yielded the turnip-like rutabagas, which they ate raw&#10;and boiled and baked and raw again.

    <node id="William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language. He is best known for his numerous plays, many of which are considered classics in literature and theater. Although not much is known about his life, it is believed that he was born in Stratford-on-Avon and later moved to London where he became a prominent figure in the theater scene.&#10;&#10;Some of Shakespeare's most well-known plays include &quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; which features a beautiful love story and explores a woman's intellect, drawing appreciation from women's clubs. The play focuses on Shylock, a Jewish moneylender who opposes his daughter's marriage to a Venetian gentleman named Antonio. Other famous works by Shakespeare include &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; &quot;Hamlet,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Othello,&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; These plays, along with many others, have been widely performed, studied, and admired for centuries due to their rich language, compelling narratives, and complex characters." />

Not much was&#10;known about his life, but after all that did not really make so much&#10;difference, because they loved to read his numerous plays, several of&#10;the best known of which she would now criticize.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the best known of his plays was &quot;" />

And perhaps there are several poets&#10;not mentioned today whom it might be worth while considering--Keats, for&#10;instance, and Matthew Arnold and Rossetti and Swinburne.

Burns&#10;had to work hard and was sometimes led by evil companionship into low&#10;habits.

Even before the entrance of the&#10;coffee and hot rolls Carol seized on Mrs. Champ Perry, the kind and&#10;ample-bosomed pioneer woman who gave historic dignity to the modern&#10;matrons of the Thanatopsis.

She suggested that the Thanatopsis ought to help the poor&#10;of the town. She was ever so correct and modern. She did not, she said,&#10;want charity for them, but a chance of self-help; an employment bureau,&#10;direction in washing babies and making pleasing stews, possibly a&#10;municipal fund for home-building. &quot;What do you think of my plans, Mrs.&#10;Warren?&quot; she concluded.&#10;&#10;Speaking judiciously, as one related to the church by marriage," />

After all, it's the churches, isn't it, that are the&#10;real heart of the community. As you may possibly know, my husband&#10;is prominent in Congregational circles all through the state for&#10;his advocacy of church-union. He hopes to see all the evangelical&#10;denominations joined in one strong body, opposing Catholicism and&#10;Christian Science, and properly guiding all movements that make for&#10;morality and prohibition. Here, the combined churches could afford&#10;a splendid club-house, maybe a stucco and half-timber building with&#10;gargoyles and all sorts of pleasing decorations on it, which, it seems&#10;to me, would be lots better to impress the ordinary class of people than&#10;just a plain old-fashioned colonial house, such as you describe.

    <node id="Carol's hope for her Utopian plans of creating a new city hall in Gopher Prairie faces several challenges, including resistance from the town council and the influence of the clubwomen's husbands over the town. The narrative mentions that it would be unlikely for the city council to propose or Gopher Prairie to vote for funds for a new city hall within the next 20 years. Moreover, Vida Sherwin, an influential figure in the town, doubts the feasibility of such a plan and emphasizes the difficulties they faced in getting the city council elected. Additionally, the clubwomen's husbands hold significant power in Gopher Prairie, which can make it challenging for Carol to push through her plans.&#10;&#10;However, Carol remains optimistic about her Utopian vision and seeks allies among the influential members of the community, such as the Dawsons. By asking Mr. Dawson if he's a millionaire, she may be trying to gauge whether he would have the financial resources to support her reform efforts. Furthermore, Carol's visit to Mrs. Dawson to lead a literary discussion suggests that she is building relationships with other influential members of the community as she continues her quest to improve Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there are significant challenges to Carol's plans for creating a new city hall in Gopher Prairie, she remains hopeful and actively seeks allies among the town's influential figures.

This idealized vision contrasts with the reality of their current situation in Archangel, which they find dull and uninspiring. The reference to Venice serves as a metaphor for the cultural enrichment that co-operative movements could bring to their rural community, providing access to activities such as dancing, lectures, and plays.&#10;&#10;By drawing this comparison, the speaker emphasizes the transformative potential of cooperative efforts. However, they also acknowledge the challenges they face in trying to implement these changes, likening it to &quot;scolding&quot; the Northern seas for not being tender-colored like those in Venice.

    <node id="There are efforts being made by Carol Kennicott, the librarian, to improve the ugliness of Gopher Prairie. She discovers pictures of New England streets, house-decoration periodicals, and a six-year file of the National Geographic in a room that resembles a grandmother's attic, which represents her enthusiasm for knowledge, town-planning, and house-decoration. Carol plans to use this collection to improve the community and library in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's first reform effort is to focus on the improvement of Gopher Prairie's city hall. She becomes an active citizen by advocating for a new city hall, which she sees as an opportunity to engage with the community and address Mrs. Nat Hicks' wish that the young people could have free dances at the city hall, as the lodge dances are so exclusive.&#10;&#10;However, there is resistance from the town council and the influence of the clubwomen's husbands over the town, which can make it challenging for Carol to push through her plans. The narrative mentions that it would be unlikely for the city council to propose or Gopher Prairie to vote for funds for a new city hall within the next 20 years. Additionally, Vida Sherwin, an influential figure in the town, doubts the feasibility of such a plan and emphasizes the difficulties they faced in getting the city council elected.&#10;&#10;The resistance from the men in the town to spend money on improvements according to the views of an outsider can be attributed to their lack of vision for the town's potential beauty and their belief that it is unnecessary to spend money on improvements. They think that the ugliness is a matter of taste, and they do not see why they should like what a Boston architect likes. The men in Gopher Prairie prefer to focus on selling prunes rather than improving the town's aesthetics.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol Kennicott is making efforts to improve the ugliness of Gopher Prairie by focusing on creating a new city hall and engaging with the community. However, she faces resistance from the town council and the influence of the clubwomen's husbands over the town.

    <node id="The narrative does not directly mention the concerns of a specific person regarding scientific farming, education, or architectural changes in their town. However, it does provide insight into the views of the main character, Carol Kennicott, on these topics.&#10;&#10;Carol does not have any explicit concerns about scientific farming mentioned in the narrative. Instead, she is more focused on the need for improving the cultural and intellectual life of Gopher Prairie, as well as its physical appearance. She believes that the town's architectural style is outdated, and she hopes to bring about changes that would modernize it and make it a more pleasant place to live.&#10;&#10;Regarding education, Carol sees the potential in utilizing resources such as the pictures of New England streets, house-decoration periodicals, and National Geographic issues to improve the community and library in Gopher Prairie. This interest in expanding access to knowledge reflects her belief that education can help uplift the town and its residents.&#10;&#10;Her enthusiasm for literature is evident when she agrees to assist Mrs. Dawson with a poetry discussion focused on English poets. By leading this literary exploration, Carol aims to liberalize the town and engage the community in intellectual pursuits.&#10;&#10;The resistance that Carol faces from the town council, clubwomen's husbands, and other influential figures demonstrates the challenges of bringing about change in Gopher Prairie. Despite these obstacles, Carol remains optimistic about her Utopian vision and seeks allies among the town's influential figures to help her reform efforts.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no direct mention of concerns regarding scientific farming, the character Carol Kennicott demonstrates an interest in improving education and architectural changes in her town, with a particular focus on expanding access to knowledge and modernizing the town's appearance. She sees these changes as essential for uplifting Gopher Prairie and its residents." />
    <node id="Robert Burns was a Scottish poet who lived in the 18th century. He is known for his self-education, having worked hard to gain knowledge despite not having the same educational advantages as many people today. This contrasts with Lord Byron, an aristocratic British poet, who moved in high society circles.&#10;&#10;Burns had a humble background and sometimes struggled with low habits, but he was also a good student who educated himself. His poetry often reflected his experiences and the beauty of rural life, as seen in his pieces about mice and other rustic subjects. He is particularly known for his poem &quot;To a Mouse,&quot; which explores themes of humility and nature's indifference to human concerns.&#10;&#10;Lord Byron, on the other hand, was born into an aristocratic family and enjoyed the privileges that came with his social standing. While he received a formal education, his lifestyle was sometimes criticized for being loose and contrary to traditional values. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, his poetry gained widespread popularity during his lifetime.&#10;&#10;The text mentions Byron's &quot;so-called aristocratic society-life&quot; in contrast to Burns' humble origins and self-education. This suggests that the speaker sees value in Burns' life story and considers him a more morally instructive figure due to his hard work, perseverance, and appreciation for the simple things in life.&#10;&#10;In summary, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet who rose from humble beginnings through self-education, while Lord Byron was an aristocratic British poet born into wealth and privilege. The contrast between their lives and work is highlighted by their different societal standings, educational experiences, and the themes reflected in their poetry." />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that people, including those in Gopher Prairie, create unnecessary problems and artificial conflicts for pleasure or spite due to a lack of more pressing concerns now that they have &quot;conquered nature&quot; and secured their basic needs. With the absence of natural threats, humans have turned to manufacturing their own difficulties and disputes, such as religious disagreements, social hierarchies, and commercial rivalries.&#10;&#10;In Gopher Prairie, this phenomenon is evident in the form of petty squabbles, rigid social expectations, and hypocrisy among the ruling class. The town's citizens feel compelled to uphold specific standards and appearances to maintain their status, which often leads to insincerity and an inability to live up to these self-imposed ideals. This situation creates a suffocating environment where genuine human connection and expression are discouraged, further fueling the desire for artificial conflicts and pleasure-seeking behaviors." />

    <node id="1. Carol initiated a plan to improve Gopher Prairie's city hall as her first reform effort. She was motivated by the discovery that the town was legally organized with a mayor and city-council, and that the current city hall was inadequate for the community's needs.&#10;2. Carol's attempt to create a meaningful clique failed in Gopher Prairie because of her idealistic approach and her reluctance to conform to the town's narrow social norms. Her efforts to engage with the community, such as leading literary discussions and advocating for a new city hall, were met with resistance from the town's conservative elements.&#10;3. In response to her failed attempts at reform, Carol sought inspiration from the pioneers' history, which she learned about from Mrs. Champ Perry. She was drawn to the pioneers' values of sturdiness, integrity, self-sufficiency, and community, which she saw as a model for restoring these virtues to contemporary society. This suggested that Carol recognized the need to understand and connect with the town's history and values in order to effectively engage with its citizens and bring about meaningful change." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Carol's hope in creating a &quot;gardeny place&quot; for Gopher Prairie seems to be limited, as she faces significant challenges from the town council and the influential clubwomen's husbands.

She suggests that the clubwomen's husbands hold significant power in Gopher Prairie, which can make it challenging for Carol to push through her plans.&#10;&#10;Carol had initially avoided discussing her plans with Vida due to her big-sister manner and fear of idea-snatching, but she eventually sketches her Utopia to Vida. Vida responds by expressing her support for the idea but emphasizing its impracticality, citing the challenges they faced in getting the city council elected.&#10;&#10;The clubwomen and their husbands play a significant role in Carol's aspiration for Gopher Prairie. The clubwomen are already involved in various community projects, such as tree-planting, anti-fly campaigns, and managing the restroom. However, their husbands, who hold significant power in the town, may pose a challenge to Carol's plans.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Carol faces significant challenges from the town council and the influential clubwomen's husbands, she remains hopeful and actively seeks allies among the town's influential figures.

    <node id="Mrs. Warren's view on helping the less fortunate is that it should be considered as charity rather than scientific schemes for abolishing poverty. She believes this because she thinks that genuine poverty is something that will always exist, and that there is nobility and joy in fulfilling one's duty to help those who are less fortunate. She also suggests that people who receive help will be more grateful if they recognize it as charity rather than a right. Furthermore, Mrs. Warren believes that the pleasure of giving is an important part of the Christian experience." />

But I&#10;must say it seems to me we should lose the whole point of the thing by&#10;not regarding it as charity. Why, that's the chief adornment of the true&#10;Christian and the church! The Bible has laid it down for our guidance.&#10;'Faith, Hope, and CHARITY,' it says, and, 'The poor ye have with ye&#10;always,' which indicates that there never can be anything to these&#10;so-called scientific schemes for abolishing charity, never! And isn't it&#10;better so? I should hate to think of a world in which we were deprived&#10;of all the pleasure of giving.

He is known for his self-education, having worked hard to gain knowledge despite not having the same educational advantages as many people today. This contrasts with Lord Byron, an aristocratic British poet, who moved in high society circles.&#10;&#10;Burns had a humble background and sometimes struggled with low habits, but he was also a good student who educated himself. His poetry often reflected his experiences and the beauty of rural life, as seen in his pieces about mice and other rustic subjects. He is particularly known for his poem &quot;To a Mouse,&quot; which explores themes of humility and nature's indifference to human concerns.&#10;&#10;Lord Byron, on the other hand, was born into an aristocratic family and enjoyed the privileges that came with his social standing. While he received a formal education, his lifestyle was sometimes criticized for being loose and contrary to traditional values. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, his poetry gained widespread popularity during his lifetime.&#10;&#10;The text mentions Byron's &quot;so-called aristocratic society-life&quot; in contrast to Burns' humble origins and self-education. This suggests that the speaker sees value in Burns' life story and considers him a more morally instructive figure due to his hard work, perseverance, and appreciation for the simple things in life.&#10;&#10;In summary, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet who rose from humble beginnings through self-education, while Lord Byron was an aristocratic British poet born into wealth and privilege. The contrast between their lives and work is highlighted by their different societal standings, educational experiences, and the themes reflected in their poetry.">

The narrative mentions that it would be unlikely for the city council to propose or Gopher Prairie to vote for funds for a new city hall within the next 20 years. Additionally, Vida Sherwin, an influential figure in the town, doubts the feasibility of such a plan and emphasizes the difficulties they faced in getting the city council elected.&#10;&#10;The resistance from the men in the town to spend money on improvements according to the views of an outsider can be attributed to their lack of vision for the town's potential beauty and their belief that it is unnecessary to spend money on improvements. They think that the ugliness is a matter of taste, and they do not see why they should like what a Boston architect likes. The men in Gopher Prairie prefer to focus on selling prunes rather than improving the town's aesthetics.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol Kennicott is making efforts to improve the ugliness of Gopher Prairie by focusing on creating a new city hall and engaging with the community. However, she faces resistance from the town council and the influence of the clubwomen's husbands over the town. The men in the town resist spending money on improvements according to the views of an outsider, believing that it is unnecessary and a matter of taste.">

He is known for his self-education, having worked hard to gain knowledge despite not having the same educational advantages as many people today. This contrasts with Lord Byron, an aristocratic British poet, who moved in high society circles.&#10;&#10;Burns had a humble background and sometimes struggled with low habits, but he was also a good student who educated himself. His poetry often reflected his experiences and the beauty of rural life, as seen in his pieces about mice and other rustic subjects. He is particularly known for his poem &quot;To a Mouse,&quot; which explores themes of humility and nature's indifference to human concerns.&#10;&#10;Lord Byron, on the other hand, was born into an aristocratic family and enjoyed the privileges that came with his social standing. While he received a formal education, his lifestyle was sometimes criticized for being loose and contrary to traditional values. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, his poetry gained widespread popularity during his lifetime.&#10;&#10;The text mentions Byron's &quot;so-called aristocratic society-life&quot; in contrast to Burns' humble origins and self-education. This suggests that the speaker sees value in Burns' life story and considers him a more morally instructive figure due to his hard work, perseverance, and appreciation for the simple things in life.&#10;&#10;In summary, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet who rose from humble beginnings through self-education, while Lord Byron was an aristocratic British poet born into wealth and privilege. The contrast between their lives and work is highlighted by their different societal standings, educational experiences, and the themes reflected in their poetry.">

He is known for his self-education, having worked hard to gain knowledge despite not having the same educational advantages as many people today. This contrasts with Lord Byron, an aristocratic British poet, who moved in high society circles.&#10;&#10;Burns had a humble background and sometimes struggled with low habits, but he was also a good student who educated himself. His poetry often reflected his experiences and the beauty of rural life, as seen in his pieces about mice and other rustic subjects. He is particularly known for his poem &quot;To a Mouse,&quot; which explores themes of humility and nature's indifference to human concerns.&#10;&#10;Lord Byron, on the other hand, was born into an aristocratic family and enjoyed the privileges that came with his social standing. While he received a formal education, his lifestyle was sometimes criticized for being loose and contrary to traditional values. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, his poetry gained widespread popularity during his lifetime.&#10;&#10;The text mentions Byron's &quot;so-called aristocratic society-life&quot; in contrast to Burns' humble origins and self-education. This suggests that the speaker sees value in Burns' life story and considers him a more morally instructive figure due to his hard work, perseverance, and appreciation for the simple things in life.&#10;&#10;In summary, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet who rose from humble beginnings through self-education, while Lord Byron was an aristocratic British poet born into wealth and privilege.

However, it does provide insight into the views of the main character, Carol Kennicott, on these topics.&#10;&#10;Carol does not have any explicit concerns about scientific farming mentioned in the narrative. Instead, she is more focused on the need for improving the cultural and intellectual life of Gopher Prairie, as well as its physical appearance. She believes that the town's architectural style is outdated, and she hopes to bring about changes that would modernize it and make it a more pleasant place to live.&#10;&#10;Regarding education, Carol sees the potential in utilizing resources such as the pictures of New England streets, house-decoration periodicals, and National Geographic issues to improve the community and library in Gopher Prairie. This interest in expanding access to knowledge reflects her belief that education can help uplift the town and its residents.&#10;&#10;Her enthusiasm for literature is evident when she agrees to assist Mrs. Dawson with a poetry discussion focused on English poets.

    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is a plan for a tiramisu tasting contest and a potential barbecue activity on Sunday. However, Grad A will be out of town visiting their parents, so they will not be able to participate in these activities. The location of where they are going to visit their parents is specified as the South Bay. Grad C has mentioned that they should be free on Sunday. As for Grad D, they are organizing the tiramisu tasting contest and are working out the details, including the panel of impartial judges who will do a blind taste test and then vote." />
    <node id=" then vote .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Should be fun .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Seems like {disfmarker} Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours . Then , if you were to bribe them , you could uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . Well , I was thinking if um {disfmarker} y you guys have plans for Sunday ? We 're {disfmarker} we 're not {disfmarker} it 's probably going to be this Sunday , but um we 're sort of working with the weather here because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what {disfmarker} whoever brings whatever you know , can throw it on there . So only the tiramisu is free , nothing else .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Well , I 'm going back to visit my parents this weekend , so , I 'll be out of town .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So you 're going" />
    <node id=" coffee shop , in San Francisco , and uh he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso , and he 's like &quot; excuse me I ordered the large espresso ? &quot;&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Uh . We 're having , {vocalsound} a tiramisu tasting contest this weekend .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Wait {disfmarker} do are y So you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: No ? Um . There was a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Ah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste {disfmarker} do a blind taste {vocalsound} and then vote .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Should be fun .&#10;Speaker: Grad" />

Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So um .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: I wasn't {disfmarker} wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for {pause}" />
    <node id=" &quot; Travel constraints &quot; would be something like you know , maybe they said they can {disfmarker} they only wanna take a bus or something like that , right ? And then those are somewhat related to the path ,&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: so that would determine whether we 'd {disfmarker} could take {disfmarker} we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . Um , &quot; Goal &quot; . Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination . Um , and then if you go up , Robert , Yeah , so {disfmarker} um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person . Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Uh , Prosody I don't really {disf" />

That would be , I don't know , the &quot; landmark - iness &quot; of things ," />
    <node id="The goal of developing a &quot;Constructicon&quot; is to find ways of writing down Image schemas, X-schemas, and constructions in a formal manner. This would allow for the rules governing the activation of these constructions to be encoded in a Bayes-net input system. The previous rules that are currently being used will be replaced entirely by this new system.&#10;&#10;The way this new system will work is by taking an input, such as an &quot;approach&quot; construction, and activating the appropriate construction based on that input. This decision as to which construction to activate will be made by the Bayes-net system. The previous rules that were used to make these decisions will no longer be in effect.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the development of the Constructicon will allow for the creation of a reference for semantic parameters for X-schemas. This will enable users to specialize generalized X-schemas by supplying the necessary parameters. Overall, the goal of developing the Constructicon is to create a more flexible and efficient system for activating appropriate constructions based on input, replacing the previous rules-based system with a Bayes-net input system." />
    <node id=" Source , Path , Goal , whatever .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some {disfmarker} some form , and have this be in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in the content , loosely called &quot; Constructicon &quot; . And the rules we want to throw away completely . And um {disfmarker} and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net , which is exactly getting the input feeding into here . This decides whether it 's an whether action {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Enter , the Vista , or the whatever&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh , &quot; approach &quot; , you called it , I think this time .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: That 's what you said {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's fine . Yeah , but {disfmarker}" />
    <node id=" B&#10;Content: That 's what you said {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's fine . Yeah , but {disfmarker} Right . But it 's not construction there , it 's action . Construction is a d is a different story .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Right . This is uh {disfmarker} so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the {disfmarker} for the X - schema ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} Yes .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah . So that {disfmarker} that uh i if you had the generalized &quot; Go &quot; X - schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And then uh , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go" />
    <node id=" try to do a knowledge engineering thing&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that . Um and&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: &quot; Eh - eh - eh . &quot; Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: So that {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Well , mmm , something . I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and , um , I understand where this {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector" />
    <node id=" know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John {disfmarker} Johno said .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah . But the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the nice thing is that you know , it just is a {disfmarker} is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: and uh&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that {disfmarker} that is helpful to them .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: I mean , ultimately we {disfmarker} we may w w we regard this as sort of an exercise in {disfmarker} in thinking about the problem and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wanna" />
    <node id="disfmarker} I know how to do any individual case , right ? but I don't yet {disfmarker} see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to {pause} get powerful generalizations . And&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: um&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Maybe we sho should we a add then the &quot; what 's this ? &quot; domain ? N I mean , we have to &quot; how do I get to X &quot; . Then we also have the &quot; what 's this ? &quot; domain , where we get some slightly different {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Could . Uh .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them &quot; intentions &quot; anymore .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So he {disfmarker} he dislikes the term .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Well , I {disfmarker} I don't like the term either ," />
    <node id=" of first principles thinking about this . I just at the moment don't know .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: H No . Well , no the Bayes {disfmarker} the Bayes - nets {disfmarker} The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision . But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the {disfmarker} uh general . So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , and there 's a language for talking about trajectors , you shouldn't have to do that differently for uh uh going to something , than for circling it , for uh telling someone else how to go there ,&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Getting out of {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: whatever it is . So that {disfmarker} that , the {disfmarker} the decision processes are gonna be different What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have" />
    <node id="In this context, prosody refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, as opposed to the actual words or syntax used. The parse, on the other hand, refers to the structure of a sentence in terms of its grammatical components, such as subjects, verbs, and objects. World knowledge is the use of real-world information to understand language, for example, knowing that certain places have specific opening and closing times. Prosody provides additional context and meaning beyond the words themselves and helps convey emotions or attitudes. It's different from the parse and world knowledge as it focuses on how something is said rather than what is said or the background knowledge required to understand it." />
    <node id=" or {disfmarker} so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff . Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Alright , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the thesis level&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs because they 're really fancy then , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for these kinds of analysis .

    <node id="marker} the decision processes are gonna be different What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs . So all sorts of different tasks {pause} and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . And that 's {disfmarker} that would be the really pretty result . And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , i that {disfmarker} that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent {disfmarker} you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , in independent of whether it {disfmarker} about {disfmarker} what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you" />
    <node id=" , you have prepositional phrases that {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah , but they 're {disfmarker} they 're easier for parsers .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Parsers can pick those up but {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker} with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time . Because the {disfmarker} mean the semantics are very complex in that .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: OK , yeah ? I had one more {pause} thing . I don't remember . I just forgot it again . No . Oh yeah , b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to {disfmarker} to throw this away and {disfmarker} and replace it with something else , or whatever , so that we have {disfmarker} so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , that generalize over those" />

    <node id="1. Define the nodes: The first step in converting the sketch into a real Bayes-net would be to define the nodes in the network. Each concept or variable discussed in the conversation, such as &quot;Image schemas,&quot; &quot;X-schemas,&quot; and &quot;constructions,&quot; could be a node in the network.&#10;2. Determine relationships: The next step would be to determine the relationships between these nodes. This can be done by analyzing the conversation and identifying how each concept influences or is influenced by other concepts. For example, the Bayes-net input system may influence which construction is activated based on the input provided.&#10;3. Specify probabilities: Once the nodes and relationships have been determined, probability distributions would need to be assigned to each node. These probability distributions reflect the likelihood of a particular value for that node, given its parent nodes in the network. For example, the probability distribution for the &quot;construction activation&quot; node may depend on the input provided and the Bayes-net input system.&#10;4. Verify and refine: After filling in these details, it's important to verify that the resulting Bayes-net accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed in the conversation. This step may involve iterative refinement and validation with domain experts or through simulation studies.&#10;5. Implement and test: Finally, the fully specified Bayes-net can be implemented in a suitable programming language or software platform and tested for its effectiveness in solving the problem at hand. This may involve comparing its performance to that of the previous rules-based system or evaluating it against other criteria established by the project goals." />
    <node id=" where this {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and {disfmarker} and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh , I don't think our friends uh on Wednesday are going to be able to {disfmarker} Well , maybe they will .

Now . Alright , so I understand what 's {disfmarker} what you got . I don't yet understand {pause} how you would use it . So let me see if I can ask&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Well , this is not a working Bayes - net .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: a s Right . No , I understand that , but {disfmarker} but um So , what {disfmarker} Let 's slide back up again and see {disfmarker} start at the {disfmarker} at the bottom and Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop . Yeah . So , you could imagine w Uh , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something .&#10;Speaker: Grad" />
    <node id="The speakers, particularly Professor B, express a desire to develop a generalized method for extracting properties to be used in different Bayes networks across various decision processes. This would enable them to handle sources, trajectors, and other concepts in a consistent manner, regardless of the specific decision being made or the context of the conversation. By doing so, they aim to create a flexible and efficient system for activating appropriate constructions based on input, replacing the previous rules-based system with a Bayes-net input system." />
    <node id=" it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that {disfmarker} OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah . And , um So .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: So in that case , the sum we 'd have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes . We 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were {disfmarker} I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So what I was gonna say is {disfmarker} is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally {disfmarker} I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are .

    <node id=" about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n {pause} each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics . So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , OK ? then you could say &quot; Aha , let 's have these three factors &quot; , OK ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And then the question would be if {disfmarker} if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about .

    <node id="The purpose of signing up for the Wednesday slot is to hold discussions about the system design, particularly focusing on integrating belief-nets into the system.

The aim is to get the linguists contributing to the development process, which will help re-formulate things and create summary nodes that are independent of specific problems, but rather generalize over them.

    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is a plan for a tiramisu tasting contest and a potential barbecue activity on Sunday. Grad A will be out of town visiting their parents in the South Bay, so they will not be able to participate. The rest of the group is planning to work with the weather and combine the contest with a barbecue activity where everyone can bring their own food to grill. However, only the tiramisu tasting is free, as they are not providing other food or drinks for the barbecue. Grad D is organizing the contest and working out details such as impartial judges who will do a blind taste test and then vote." />
    <node id=" baseline case , that 's another sort of thing &quot; OK , here 's a {disfmarker} another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this &quot; . Add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property you have an action , &quot; pppt ! &quot; You do that . Um , then the question would be Uh Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology , OK ? because that 's all {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} all you 're using is this type {disfmarker} the types in the ontology and you 're done .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Hmm ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right ?

    <node id="1. The group does not believe that the provided screenshot accurately represents a Bayes net. Grad D suggests treating it as a UML diagram or a simple screenshot, while Professor B is unsure if they can present it to their friends on Wednesday as a Bayes net. They refer to it as a visual aid for thinking about the concepts discussed, which still need to be specified more carefully.&#10;2. The group plans to use the process of converting the sketch into a real Bayes-net as a way to engage linguists in the development process. By defining nodes, determining relationships, specifying probabilities, and refining the model through verification, they aim to create a high-quality system that generalizes over specific problems.&#10;3. They intend to present the concept of using belief-nets to the computer scientists involved in the project, explaining how these networks fit into the overall system design. Additionally, they will discuss the task, dialogue, and linguistic aspects with the linguists, encouraging their contribution to the development process. This collaboration aims to help re-formulate things and create summary nodes that are independent of specific problems, resulting in a more efficient and flexible system for decision making." />
    <node id="1. Define the nodes: The process for defining nodes would remain the same, where each concept or variable discussed is treated as a node in the network. For example, &quot;Source-path-goal trajector&quot; could be a node.&#10;2. Determine relationships: This step would also stay similar, with relationships between nodes determined by analyzing the conversation and identifying how concepts influence one another. In this case, the relationship between input and construction activation could be specified.&#10;3. Specify probabilities: However, when turning the sketch into a real Bayes-net with actual values, additional effort is required to assign accurate probability distributions to each node. This may involve gathering empirical data or consulting domain experts to estimate the likelihood of different values for each node based on its parents in the network.&#10;4. Verify and refine: The verification step becomes more critical when dealing with actual values, as it's essential to ensure that the Bayes-net accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed. This might involve iterative refinement and validation with domain experts or through simulation studies.&#10;5. Implement and test: Once the Bayes-net has been fully specified, it can be implemented in a suitable programming language or software platform. However, when working with actual values, additional care must be taken to ensure that the implementation accurately represents the probability distributions and relationships defined in the network. Furthermore, thorough testing is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bayes-net in solving the problem at hand.&#10;&#10;In summary, turning the sketch into a real Bayes net with actual values requires additional effort in specifying probabilities, verifying the accuracy of the network, and ensuring that both the implementation and testing accurately represent the defined probability distributions and relationships." />
    <node id="1. Spatial adverbs can pose significant challenges to parsers because they often involve complex semantics, making it difficult for parsing algorithms to accurately interpret their meaning within a sentence. This is due to the fact that spatial adverbs require understanding of spatial relationships and concepts, which may not be explicitly stated in the text itself.&#10;&#10;2. An architecture like the one being discussed might enable the replacement of certain representational formats by providing a more generalized method for extracting properties to be used across different Bayes networks and decision processes. By standardizing the way information is represented and activated within these networks, it becomes easier to swap out specific components or representations with alternative options that serve the same purpose. This flexibility can lead to improved efficiency and performance, as well as better adaptability in handling a wide range of decision-making scenarios." />
    <node id="1. Nodes in the Bayes network: Based on the text, potential nodes could include &quot;spatial adverbs,&quot; &quot;parsers,&quot; &quot;Image schemas,&quot; &quot;X-schemas,&quot; &quot;constructions,&quot; and &quot;Bayes-net input system.&quot;&#10;2. Relationships between nodes: The relationships between these nodes would be determined by analyzing the conversation and identifying how each concept influences or is influenced by other concepts. For example, the Bayes-net input system might influence which construction is activated based on the input provided.&#10;3. Semantic implications of a container construction: By analyzing the text, we can determine that a construction treating a referred entity as a container has semantic implications, such as the possibility of subsequent questions or actions related to that entity involving it as a container (e.g., &quot;how do I get into the castle&quot; or &quot;what is there in the castle&quot;).&#10;4. Impact on processing subsequent information: The text suggests that this deep semantic information, obtained from local constructions, could impact the way you process everything else. This might involve retrieving additional information related to the container entity and adjusting the processing of subsequent questions or actions accordingly.&#10;5. Development of a Constructicon: The goal is to create a system for writing down Image schemas, X-schemas, and constructions in a formal manner, allowing for the rules governing the activation of these constructions to be encoded in a Bayes-net input system. This would replace the previous rules-based system entirely and enable more efficient activation of appropriate constructions based on input." />
    <node id="disfmarker} what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way .

    <node id="The &quot;landmark-ness&quot; concept that Grad A mentioned refers to the significance or noteworthiness of a place, as if it were included in a tour book. In the context of a tourbook, this concept could be used to determine whether a particular location is a popular tourist destination or has unique features that make it worth visiting.&#10;&#10;Grad A suggests using this concept in combination with other factors, such as the person's current location and their travel constraints, to create image schema categories for a belief network. The idea is to use these categories to analyze and understand a person's behavior or intentions related to traveling or navigating through space.&#10;&#10;For example, if a person is at a landmark, they might be more likely to spend time there or take pictures, rather than hurrying to their next destination. Similarly, if someone has indicated that they only want to use public transportation, this might affect which landmarks or destinations are accessible to them. By considering these different factors together, it may be possible to make more accurate predictions about a person's behavior or preferences in a given context." />
    <node id="Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: or they were hurried . That 's kind of related to that .

    <node id="isfmarker} we have uh {disfmarker} I was just made some examples from the ontology and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a building and it has doors and stuff like this , but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history , &quot; were any of these things that {disfmarker} that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? &quot; ,&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: &quot; were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? &quot; ,&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: and so forth , and maybe draw some inferences on that .

    <node id="1. The group, including Speaker: Grad D and Professor B, acknowledges the need to reformulate certain aspects of their project. They hope that some linguists will become interested enough to contribute to this process, helping to create summary nodes that are independent of specific problems and leading to a higher quality system.&#10;2. On Wednesday, they plan to discuss the system design with both linguists and computer scientists. For the linguists, the focus will be on the task, dialogue, and linguistic aspects of the system. For the computer scientists, they will explain where belief-nets fit into the overall design and how the pieces fit together.&#10;3. The conversation between Speaker: Grad D and Professor B suggests that they will use the process of converting a sketch into a real Bayes-net as a way to engage linguists in the development process. This hands-on activity will involve defining nodes, determining relationships, specifying probabilities, and refining the model through verification.&#10;4. By fostering collaboration between linguists and computer scientists, they aim to create a more efficient and flexible system for decision making, as both groups contribute their expertise to understanding the system design and the role of belief-nets within it." />

    <node id="1. Audio Quality: There were issues with the audio quality during the meeting, particularly regarding a participant referred to as &quot;the wizard&quot; who was sometimes not audible due to wireless connection problems. It was suggested that she should be moved closer to improve her audio transmission.&#10;&#10;2. Mispronunciation: Speaker Grad A raised a question about whether a participant mispronounced the word &quot;Anlage.&quot; No clear conclusion or response was noted in the transcript regarding this issue, but it demonstrates potential linguistic concerns within the group.&#10;&#10;3. Recording the Meeting: Professor B asked if the meeting was being recorded. Speaker Grad D did not explicitly confirm or deny this, which might indicate a need for better communication about recording meetings, if necessary, to ensure proper documentation and consent from all participants.&#10;&#10;4. Improving Future Sessions: To enhance future sessions, Speaker Grad D suggested that lessons learned should include having shorter reading materials (five minutes being too long) and using bullet points instead of lengthy texts for better readability and comprehension. Additionally, the group discussed making presentations optional, as they might not be necessary in every meeting and could potentially distract from the main topics of discussion." />

    <node id="1. Introducing a self-introduction by the system: The suggestion was made that when the system is called or initiated, it should introduce itself to the user. This would provide a better introduction for the wizard, making the interaction more user-friendly and engaging.&#10;   &#10;2. Alternating between human and computer tasks: Another proposal was to have subjects switch tasks between interacting with a computer and interacting with a human. This approach would result in gathering nice data for analysis and help refine the tasks more specifically. By avoiding rephrasing or giving direct instructions, users would be less likely to repeat specific phrases or actions when interacting with the system." />
    <node id=" . We need to {disfmarker} So that 's one thing . And we need a better introduction for the wizard .

    <node id="1. Speaker A is open to the idea of using a &quot;knowledge engineering&quot; approach to tackle the problem of reformulating certain aspects of the project, but they need more guidance on how to merge the existing systems together. They also express concern about the technical problem of managing too many factors in the belief-nets.&#10;2. Speaker B is supportive of developing a generalized method for extracting properties for different Bayes networks across various decision processes. They aim to create a flexible and efficient system for activating appropriate constructions based on input, replacing the previous rules-based system with a Bayes-net input system. Speaker B also acknowledges the need to address the technical problem of managing too many factors in the belief-nets and wants to focus on the most crucial ones.&#10;3. Speaker D suggests adding the &quot;what's this?&quot; domain to the system, which would involve summarizing nodes that are independent of specific problems, leading to a higher quality system. They also mention that there might be some interesting aspects related to linguistics in addressing &quot;what's this?&quot; questions." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;landmark-ness&quot; tourbook referred to by Speaker A is a concept that signifies the significance or noteworthiness of a place, as if it were included in a tour book. This idea can be used to determine whether a particular location is a popular tourist destination or has unique features that make it worth visiting.&#10;2. The speakers discuss using this &quot;landmark-ness&quot; concept in combination with other factors, such as the person's current location and their travel constraints, to create image schema categories for a belief network. By considering these different factors together, they aim to analyze and understand a person's behavior or intentions related to traveling or navigating through space.&#10;3. The speakers mention that this discussion is in connection with a non-working Bayes net. They plan to replace the previous rules-based system with a Bayes-net input system. Instead of using rules, they want to use a belief network that decides which approach construction should be activated based on the input.&#10;4. In summary, the intended use of a &quot;landmark-ness&quot; tourbook is to help determine the significance or noteworthiness of a place in the context of travel and navigation. This concept would be applied in connection with a Bayes net by using it as one of several factors to create image schema categories for analyzing and understanding a person's behavior or intentions related to traveling or navigating through space." />
    <node id="1. The probabilities associated with each choice refer to the likelihood of a particular decision being made based on various factors, such as &quot;landmark-ness,&quot; usefulness, prosody (how something is said), parse (the verb chosen and its modification), and world knowledge (opening and closing times, time of day, etc.). These probabilities would be determined through the use of a belief network, specifically a Bayes net, which can analyze and understand a person's behavior or intentions related to traveling or navigating through space.&#10;2. Landmark-ness and usefulness can coexist as separate entities. Grad A initially suggested that they might not be mutually exclusive, and Professor B agreed, indicating that it may be necessary to treat them as separate factors within the belief network. This decision allows for a more nuanced analysis of a person's behavior or intentions in relation to travel and navigation." />
    <node id=" that , you know , th um , they add up to one , but that there 's uh {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that it doesn't have to be one zero zero .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mmm .

So whenever there 's a choice , uh {disfmarker} so like landmark - ness and usefulness ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Well , see I don't think those would be mutually {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: it seems like something could both be {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Absolutely right .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And so that you might want to then have those b Th - Then they may have to be separate . They may not be able to be" />
    <node id="The same agent that is responsible for making a decision will also be responsible for carrying it out. This agent follows a three-step process to gather information and apply the belief-net:&#10;&#10;1. First, the agent gathers initial information or uses existing data to create a vector as input for the belief-net.&#10;2. Next, the agent runs this vector through a belief-net, which is a type of artificial intelligence model used for making decisions based on probabilities. In this case, the belief-net is designed to handle M-3-L information (a specific type of data) and may require additional information from sources like an ontology, the real world, or dialogue history.&#10;3. After running the vector through the belief-net, the agent receives a new vector as output, which can then be used at the &quot;simulation or action end&quot; to determine the appropriate decision or action to take. This may involve getting more information based on the updated vector's results, creating a feedback loop for further refinement of the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;The agent is expected to be rule-driven and capable of handling tasks like interacting with different components (such as an ontology interface) to gather necessary information for the belief-net input." />
    <node id=" um there 's an issue about whether there will be {disfmarker} that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision , so it probably will .

Specify probabilities: Gather empirical data or consult domain experts to estimate the likelihood of different values for each node based on its parents in the network. Assign accurate probability distributions to each node to turn the sketch into a real Bayes-net with actual values.&#10;4. Verify and refine: Ensure that the Bayes-net accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed by iteratively refining and validating it with domain experts or through simulation studies.&#10;5. Implement and test: Once the Bayes-net has been fully specified, implement it in a suitable programming language or software platform and thoroughly test its effectiveness in solving the problem at hand." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, Grad D's assessment of a person's abilities seems to be influenced by their conversational skills and ability to provide clear and relevant responses. This is evident when Grad D discusses Lila, who impressed him more in her written communication than in conversation. He also appreciates people who can respond well to unanticipated questions, as demonstrated by his positive assessment of the &quot;wizard's&quot; performance. Furthermore, Grad D believes that involving a diverse group of individuals in tasks will yield better results, suggesting that he values diverse perspectives and experiences in assessing abilities." />

    <node id="The speakers, Grad D, Professor B, and others, are discussing the creation of a knowledge design and interface specification for a system that involves an ontology and belief-nets. They want to find a specification for an interface that can take a normal three-L (presumably a three-tiered) object and interact with the ontology to ask relevant questions and determine where different components fit in. They mention wanting to decouple the high-level, reusable rules and concepts from any specific implementation of a belief-net or decision-making system. The discussion also touches on the idea of using pedagogical belief-nets to help illustrate and explain the concepts they are working with. It is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it seems that the speakers are working on the design for an intelligent system, possibly for decision making or problem solving, and are considering how different components of the system should interact with each other." />

    <node id="1. When designing the content, the speakers considered the probabilities associated with each choice, such as business intention and touring intention. They discussed the idea that these probabilities could coexist and be treated as separate factors within a belief network, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of a person's behavior or intentions related to travel and navigation.&#10;2. The speakers also mentioned the possibility of insisting that the probabilities of business and touring intention add up to one, indicating that they are considering both intentions as mutually exclusive or complementary events within the belief network. This would mean that the probability of a person having either a business or touring intention at a given time would be 1 (or 100%).&#10;&#10;In summary, the speakers allowed for both probabilities to add up to one, indicating that they are considering both intentions as mutually exclusive or complementary events within the belief network." />

    <node id="1. Travel constraints: One of the travel constraints mentioned in the conversation was the use of public transportation as a preferred mode of travel. If a person has indicated that they only want to use public transportation, this might affect which landmarks or destinations are accessible to them.&#10;2. Goals: The goal of reaching a destination is an important factor in determining whether a person should take public transportation or walk. If the destination is far away or not easily accessible by foot, taking public transportation may be a more viable option.&#10;3. Context: The context of a person's current situation can also influence their decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if someone is dressed in business attire and needs to arrive at a meeting on time, they may choose to take public transportation rather than walking.&#10;4. Discourse: Asking about open hours or the admission fee of a destination could indicate that a person plans to visit the location, and therefore may choose to take public transportation rather than walk. Additionally, asking where the entrance is located could suggest that the person has already decided on their mode of transportation.&#10;5. World Knowledge: The time of day, opening and closing times of destinations, and other world knowledge can also influence a person's decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if a destination is closed when a person arrives, they may choose to walk to another location instead." />
    <node id="1. First, extract relevant information about the town hall from the ontology, including details that define it as both a building (with features like doors) and an institution (with elements such as a mayor).&#10;2. Analyze the dialogue history to check if any components of the town hall, either as a building or an institution, have been mentioned. This step involves looking for references to aspects like the physical structure or the institution's administration.&#10;3. Draw inferences based on the information gathered from the ontology and the dialogue history. For example, if building-related components have been mentioned, infer that the conversation focuses on the town hall as a physical structure. Conversely, if institutional elements have been discussed, conclude that the talk revolves around the town hall's administrative aspects.&#10;4. Create a vector using the information gathered from the ontology, dialogue history analysis, and inferences drawn during the process. This vector will serve as input for the belief network." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the person who pretended to be both a system and a human is referred to as &quot;Lila&quot; or &quot;she.&quot; The significance of the wizard (who is also Lila) being inaudible at times during the interaction is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it could be inferred that the inaudibility was intentional as part of the simulation, possibly to test how users would respond to interacting with a non-responsive system or to simulate technical difficulties. Grad D also mentions that Lila's performance as the &quot;wizard&quot; was impressive, suggesting that she handled unexpected questions and challenges well during the interaction." />

    <node id="1. Ideal result for decision processes: The ideal result would be having an intermediate representation that is consistent across various inputs, outputs, tasks, and ways of expressing them. This uniform mechanism would facilitate the extraction of fundamental things going on in different situations, making it easier to manage and process information.&#10;&#10;2. Fancier parser using constructions: A fancier parser utilizing construction grammar can help extract deep semantic information about users' intentions by identifying specific constructions that provide insights into what people want to do or refer to, regardless of the context (e.g., &quot;what is this&quot; or &quot;where is it&quot;). By analyzing these constructions, the parser can determine the user's intent and pull out relevant semantic information, enabling more efficient and accurate processing of user inputs." />
    <node id="1. A good next step in creating summary nodes is to follow the knowledge engineering trick suggested by Professor B, which involves defining each node's scope narrowly enough to avoid combinatorial explosions. This can be achieved by identifying the most relevant factors for the decision and creating compact decision nodes just above the final one. For example, if the decision can be characterized as a trade-off between three factors, create binary (or relatively compact) decision nodes for each factor.&#10;2. When considering relevant decision variables for making a bottom-line decision about which mode to choose, it's important to informally think about what the most crucial things are. This could include:&#10;   - Spatial adverbs&#10;   - Parsers&#10;   - Image schemas&#10;   - X-schemas&#10;   - Constructions&#10;   - Bayes-net input system&#10;&#10;By understanding how these factors interact and influence each other, you can create a more effective Bayes-net that accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed in the conversation." />
    <node id="1. Audio Quality: The audio quality of the &quot;wizard's&quot; connection was problematic due to wireless connection issues, making it difficult for others to hear her clearly. It was suggested that she move closer to improve her audio transmission.&#10;   &#10;2. Mispronunciation: Speaker Grad A questioned whether a participant mispronounced the word &quot;Anlage,&quot; but no clear conclusion or response regarding this issue is noted in the transcript, indicating potential linguistic concerns within the group.&#10;&#10;3. Recording the Meeting: Professor B asked if the meeting was being recorded, and Speaker Grad D did not explicitly confirm or deny this, suggesting a need for better communication about recording meetings to ensure proper documentation and consent from all participants.&#10;&#10;4. Improving Future Sessions: To enhance future sessions, Grad D suggested having shorter reading materials (five minutes being too long), using bullet points instead of lengthy texts for better readability and comprehension, and making presentations optional as they might not be necessary in every meeting and could potentially distract from the main topics of discussion.&#10;&#10;Litonya is a participant in the meeting who was asked to serve as the first subject during a test. Her weaknesses discussed by Professor B and Grad D include difficulties with reading aloud texts containing many names and trying to repeat complex phrases verbatim. The &quot;grammatical gender problem&quot; mentioned by Grad D might also be considered a weakness, as it caused confusion about whether &quot;wizard&quot; was the correct term for her role." />

The aim is to get the linguists contributing to the development process, which will help re-formulate things and create summary nodes that are independent of specific problems, but rather generalize over them.

Travel constraints: One of the travel constraints mentioned in the conversation was the use of public transportation as a preferred mode of travel. If a person has indicated that they only want to use public transportation, this might affect which landmarks or destinations are accessible to them.&#10;2. Goals: The goal of reaching a destination is an important factor in determining whether a person should take public transportation or walk. If the destination is far away or not easily accessible by foot, taking public transportation may be a more viable option.&#10;3. Context: The context of a person's current situation can also influence their decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if someone is dressed in business attire and needs to arrive at a meeting on time, they may choose to take public transportation rather than walking.&#10;4. Discourse: Asking about open hours or the admission fee of a destination could indicate that a person plans to visit the location, and therefore may choose to take public transportation rather than walk. Additionally, asking where the entrance is located could suggest that the person has already decided on their mode of transportation.&#10;5. World Knowledge: The time of day, opening and closing times of destinations, and other world knowledge can also influence a person's decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if a destination is closed when a person arrives, they may choose to walk to another location instead.">

In summary, the intended use of a &quot;landmark-ness&quot; tourbook is to help determine the significance or noteworthiness of a place in the context of travel and navigation.

Define the nodes: The first step in converting the sketch into a real Bayes-net would be to define the nodes in the network. Each concept or variable discussed in the conversation, such as &quot;Image schemas,&quot; &quot;X-schemas,&quot; and &quot;constructions,&quot; could be a node in the network.&#10;2. Determine relationships: The next step would be to determine the relationships between these nodes. This can be done by analyzing the conversation and identifying how each concept influences or is influenced by other concepts. For example, the Bayes-net input system may influence which construction is activated based on the input provided.&#10;3. Specify probabilities: Once the nodes and relationships have been determined, probability distributions would need to be assigned to each node. These probability distributions reflect the likelihood of a particular value for that node, given its parent nodes in the network. For example, the probability distribution for the &quot;construction activation&quot; node may depend on the input provided and the Bayes-net input system.&#10;4. Verify and refine: After filling in these details, it's important to verify that the resulting Bayes-net accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed in the conversation. This step may involve iterative refinement and validation with domain experts or through simulation studies.&#10;5. Implement and test: Finally, the fully specified Bayes-net can be implemented in a suitable programming language or software platform and tested for its effectiveness in solving the problem at hand. This may involve comparing its performance to that of the previous rules-based system or evaluating it against other criteria established by the project goals.">

Spatial adverbs can pose significant challenges to parsers because they often involve complex semantics, making it difficult for parsing algorithms to accurately interpret their meaning within a sentence. This is due to the fact that spatial adverbs require understanding of spatial relationships and concepts, which may not be explicitly stated in the text itself.&#10;&#10;2.

This uniform mechanism would facilitate the extraction of fundamental things going on in different situations, making it easier to manage and process information.&#10;&#10;2. Fancier parser using constructions: A fancier parser utilizing construction grammar can help extract deep semantic information about users' intentions by identifying specific constructions that provide insights into what people want to do or refer to, regardless of the context (e.g., &quot;what is this&quot; or &quot;where is it&quot;). By analyzing these constructions, the parser can determine the user's intent and pull out relevant semantic information, enabling more efficient and accurate processing of user inputs.">

The &quot;landmark-ness&quot; tourbook referred to by Speaker A is a concept that signifies the significance or noteworthiness of a place, as if it were included in a tour book. This idea can be used to determine whether a particular location is a popular tourist destination or has unique features that make it worth visiting.&#10;2. The speakers discuss using this &quot;landmark-ness&quot; concept in combination with other factors, such as the person's current location and their travel constraints, to create image schema categories for a belief network. By considering these different factors together, they aim to analyze and understand a person's behavior or intentions related to traveling or navigating through space.&#10;3. The speakers mention that this discussion is in connection with a non-working Bayes net. They plan to replace the previous rules-based system with a Bayes-net input system. Instead of using rules, they want to use a belief network that decides which approach construction should be activated based on the input.&#10;4. In summary, the intended use of a &quot;landmark-ness&quot; tourbook is to help determine the significance or noteworthiness of a place in the context of travel and navigation. This concept would be applied in connection with a Bayes net by using it as one of several factors to create image schema categories for analyzing and understanding a person's behavior or intentions related to traveling or navigating through space.">

Define the nodes: The process for defining nodes would remain the same, where each concept or variable discussed is treated as a node in the network. For example, &quot;Source-path-goal trajector&quot; could be a node.&#10;2. Determine relationships: This step would also stay similar, with relationships between nodes determined by analyzing the conversation and identifying how concepts influence one another. In this case, the relationship between input and construction activation could be specified.&#10;3. Specify probabilities: However, when turning the sketch into a real Bayes-net with actual values, additional effort is required to assign accurate probability distributions to each node. This may involve gathering empirical data or consulting domain experts to estimate the likelihood of different values for each node based on its parents in the network.&#10;4. Verify and refine: The verification step becomes more critical when dealing with actual values, as it's essential to ensure that the Bayes-net accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed. This might involve iterative refinement and validation with domain experts or through simulation studies.&#10;5. Implement and test: Once the Bayes-net has been fully specified, it can be implemented in a suitable programming language or software platform. However, when working with actual values, additional care must be taken to ensure that the implementation accurately represents the probability distributions and relationships defined in the network. Furthermore, thorough testing is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bayes-net in solving the problem at hand.&#10;&#10;In summary, turning the sketch into a real Bayes net with actual values requires additional effort in specifying probabilities, verifying the accuracy of the network, and ensuring that both the implementation and testing accurately represent the defined probability distributions and relationships.">

Spatial adverbs can pose significant challenges to parsers because they often involve complex semantics, making it difficult for parsing algorithms to accurately interpret their meaning within a sentence. This is due to the fact that spatial adverbs require understanding of spatial relationships and concepts, which may not be explicitly stated in the text itself.&#10;&#10;2. An architecture like the one being discussed might enable the replacement of certain representational formats by providing a more generalized method for extracting properties to be used across different Bayes networks and decision processes. By standardizing the way information is represented and activated within these networks, it becomes easier to swap out specific components or representations with alternative options that serve the same purpose. This flexibility can lead to improved efficiency and performance, as well as better adaptability in handling a wide range of decision-making scenarios.">

For example, the Bayes-net input system might influence which construction is activated based on the input provided.&#10;3. Semantic implications of a container construction: By analyzing the text, we can determine that a construction treating a referred entity as a container has semantic implications, such as the possibility of subsequent questions or actions related to that entity involving it as a container (e.g., &quot;how do I get into the castle&quot; or &quot;what is there in the castle&quot;).&#10;4. Impact on processing subsequent information: The text suggests that this deep semantic information, obtained from local constructions, could impact the way you process everything else. This might involve retrieving additional information related to the container entity and adjusting the processing of subsequent questions or actions accordingly.&#10;5. Development of a Constructicon: The goal is to create a system for writing down Image schemas, X-schemas, and constructions in a formal manner, allowing for the rules governing the activation of these constructions to be encoded in a Bayes-net input system.

Next, the agent runs this vector through a belief-net, which is a type of artificial intelligence model used for making decisions based on probabilities. In this case, the belief-net is designed to handle M-3-L information (a specific type of data) and may require additional information from sources like an ontology, the real world, or dialogue history.&#10;3. After running the vector through the belief-net, the agent receives a new vector as output, which can then be used at the &quot;simulation or action end&quot; to determine the appropriate decision or action to take.

Spatial adverbs can pose significant challenges to parsers because they often involve complex semantics, making it difficult for parsing algorithms to accurately interpret their meaning within a sentence. This is due to the fact that spatial adverbs require understanding of spatial relationships and concepts, which may not be explicitly stated in the text itself.&#10;&#10;2. An architecture like the one being discussed might enable the replacement of certain representational formats by providing a more generalized method for extracting properties to be used across different Bayes networks and decision processes. By standardizing the way information is represented and activated within these networks, it becomes easier to swap out specific components or representations with alternative options that serve the same purpose. This flexibility can lead to improved efficiency and performance, as well as better adaptability in handling a wide range of decision-making scenarios.">

This agent follows a three-step process to gather information and apply the belief-net:&#10;&#10;1. First, the agent gathers initial information or uses existing data to create a vector as input for the belief-net.&#10;2. Next, the agent runs this vector through a belief-net, which is a type of artificial intelligence model used for making decisions based on probabilities. In this case, the belief-net is designed to handle M-3-L information (a specific type of data) and may require additional information from sources like an ontology, the real world, or dialogue history.&#10;3. After running the vector through the belief-net, the agent receives a new vector as output, which can then be used at the &quot;simulation or action end&quot; to determine the appropriate decision or action to take. This may involve getting more information based on the updated vector's results, creating a feedback loop for further refinement of the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;The agent is expected to be rule-driven and capable of handling tasks like interacting with different components (such as an ontology interface) to gather necessary information for the belief-net input.">

They want to find a specification for an interface that can take a normal three-L (presumably a three-tiered) object and interact with the ontology to ask relevant questions and determine where different components fit in. They mention wanting to decouple the high-level, reusable rules and concepts from any specific implementation of a belief-net or decision-making system. The discussion also touches on the idea of using pedagogical belief-nets to help illustrate and explain the concepts they are working with. It is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it seems that the speakers are working on the design for an intelligent system, possibly for decision making or problem solving, and are considering how different components of the system should interact with each other.">

Define the nodes: The process for defining nodes would remain the same, where each concept or variable discussed is treated as a node in the network. For example, &quot;Source-path-goal trajector&quot; could be a node.&#10;2. Determine relationships: This step would also stay similar, with relationships between nodes determined by analyzing the conversation and identifying how concepts influence one another. In this case, the relationship between input and construction activation could be specified.&#10;3.

This might involve retrieving additional information related to the container entity and adjusting the processing of subsequent questions or actions accordingly.&#10;5. Development of a Constructicon: The goal is to create a system for writing down Image schemas, X-schemas, and constructions in a formal manner, allowing for the rules governing the activation of these constructions to be encoded in a Bayes-net input system. This would replace the previous rules-based system entirely and enable more efficient activation of appropriate constructions based on input." target="1. Ideal result for decision processes: The ideal result would be having an intermediate representation that is consistent across various inputs, outputs, tasks, and ways of expressing them. This uniform mechanism would facilitate the extraction of fundamental things going on in different situations, making it easier to manage and process information.&#10;&#10;2. Fancier parser using constructions: A fancier parser utilizing construction grammar can help extract deep semantic information about users' intentions by identifying specific constructions that provide insights into what people want to do or refer to, regardless of the context (e.g., &quot;what is this&quot; or &quot;where is it&quot;). By analyzing these constructions, the parser can determine the user's intent and pull out relevant semantic information, enabling more efficient and accurate processing of user inputs.">

Travel constraints: One of the travel constraints mentioned in the conversation was the use of public transportation as a preferred mode of travel. If a person has indicated that they only want to use public transportation, this might affect which landmarks or destinations are accessible to them.&#10;2. Goals: The goal of reaching a destination is an important factor in determining whether a person should take public transportation or walk. If the destination is far away or not easily accessible by foot, taking public transportation may be a more viable option.&#10;3. Context: The context of a person's current situation can also influence their decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if someone is dressed in business attire and needs to arrive at a meeting on time, they may choose to take public transportation rather than walking.&#10;4. Discourse: Asking about open hours or the admission fee of a destination could indicate that a person plans to visit the location, and therefore may choose to take public transportation rather than walk. Additionally, asking where the entrance is located could suggest that the person has already decided on their mode of transportation.&#10;5. World Knowledge: The time of day, opening and closing times of destinations, and other world knowledge can also influence a person's decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if a destination is closed when a person arrives, they may choose to walk to another location instead.">

This agent follows a three-step process to gather information and apply the belief-net:&#10;&#10;1. First, the agent gathers initial information or uses existing data to create a vector as input for the belief-net.&#10;2. Next, the agent runs this vector through a belief-net, which is a type of artificial intelligence model used for making decisions based on probabilities. In this case, the belief-net is designed to handle M-3-L information (a specific type of data) and may require additional information from sources like an ontology, the real world, or dialogue history.&#10;3. After running the vector through the belief-net, the agent receives a new vector as output, which can then be used at the &quot;simulation or action end&quot; to determine the appropriate decision or action to take. This may involve getting more information based on the updated vector's results, creating a feedback loop for further refinement of the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;The agent is expected to be rule-driven and capable of handling tasks like interacting with different components (such as an ontology interface) to gather necessary information for the belief-net input.">

This step involves looking for references to aspects like the physical structure or the institution's administration.&#10;3.

This would provide a better introduction for the wizard, making the interaction more user-friendly and engaging.&#10;   &#10;2. Alternating between human and computer tasks: Another proposal was to have subjects switch tasks between interacting with a computer and interacting with a human. This approach would result in gathering nice data for analysis and help refine the tasks more specifically. By avoiding rephrasing or giving direct instructions, users would be less likely to repeat specific phrases or actions when interacting with the system." target="Based on the transcript, the person who pretended to be both a system and a human is referred to as &quot;Lila&quot; or &quot;she.&quot; The significance of the wizard (who is also Lila) being inaudible at times during the interaction is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it could be inferred that the inaudibility was intentional as part of the simulation, possibly to test how users would respond to interacting with a non-responsive system or to simulate technical difficulties. Grad D also mentions that Lila's performance as the &quot;wizard&quot; was impressive, suggesting that she handled unexpected questions and challenges well during the interaction.">

Fancier parser using constructions: A fancier parser utilizing construction grammar can help extract deep semantic information about users' intentions by identifying specific constructions that provide insights into what people want to do or refer to, regardless of the context (e.g., &quot;what is this&quot; or &quot;where is it&quot;). By analyzing these constructions, the parser can determine the user's intent and pull out relevant semantic information, enabling more efficient and accurate processing of user inputs.">

A good next step in creating summary nodes is to follow the knowledge engineering trick suggested by Professor B, which involves defining each node's scope narrowly enough to avoid combinatorial explosions. This can be achieved by identifying the most relevant factors for the decision and creating compact decision nodes just above the final one. For example, if the decision can be characterized as a trade-off between three factors, create binary (or relatively compact) decision nodes for each factor.&#10;2. When considering relevant decision variables for making a bottom-line decision about which mode to choose, it's important to informally think about what the most crucial things are.

First, extract relevant information about the town hall from the ontology, including details that define it as both a building (with features like doors) and an institution (with elements such as a mayor).&#10;2. Analyze the dialogue history to check if any components of the town hall, either as a building or an institution, have been mentioned. This step involves looking for references to aspects like the physical structure or the institution's administration.&#10;3. Draw inferences based on the information gathered from the ontology and the dialogue history. For example, if building-related components have been mentioned, infer that the conversation focuses on the town hall as a physical structure. Conversely, if institutional elements have been discussed, conclude that the talk revolves around the town hall's administrative aspects.&#10;4.

    <edge source="1. Define the nodes: Based on the conversation, identify all relevant concepts or variables as nodes in the network. Nodes could include &quot;spatial adverbs,&quot; &quot;parsers,&quot; &quot;Image schemas,&quot; &quot;X-schemas,&quot; &quot;constructions,&quot; and &quot;Bayes-net input system.&quot;&#10;2. Determine relationships: Analyze the conversation to determine how each node influences or is influenced by other nodes in the network. For example, the relationship between the &quot;input&quot; and &quot;construction activation&quot; could be specified.&#10;3. Specify probabilities: Gather empirical data or consult domain experts to estimate the likelihood of different values for each node based on its parents in the network. Assign accurate probability distributions to each node to turn the sketch into a real Bayes-net with actual values.&#10;4. Verify and refine: Ensure that the Bayes-net accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed by iteratively refining and validating it with domain experts or through simulation studies.&#10;5. Implement and test: Once the Bayes-net has been fully specified, implement it in a suitable programming language or software platform and thoroughly test its effectiveness in solving the problem at hand." target="1. A good next step in creating summary nodes is to follow the knowledge engineering trick suggested by Professor B, which involves defining each node's scope narrowly enough to avoid combinatorial explosions. This can be achieved by identifying the most relevant factors for the decision and creating compact decision nodes just above the final one. For example, if the decision can be characterized as a trade-off between three factors, create binary (or relatively compact) decision nodes for each factor.&#10;2. When considering relevant decision variables for making a bottom-line decision about which mode to choose, it's important to informally think about what the most crucial things are. This could include:&#10;   - Spatial adverbs&#10;   - Parsers&#10;   - Image schemas&#10;   - X-schemas&#10;   - Constructions&#10;   - Bayes-net input system&#10;&#10;By understanding how these factors interact and influence each other, you can create a more effective Bayes-net that accurately reflects the intended concepts and relationships discussed in the conversation.">

Travel constraints: One of the travel constraints mentioned in the conversation was the use of public transportation as a preferred mode of travel. If a person has indicated that they only want to use public transportation, this might affect which landmarks or destinations are accessible to them.&#10;2. Goals: The goal of reaching a destination is an important factor in determining whether a person should take public transportation or walk. If the destination is far away or not easily accessible by foot, taking public transportation may be a more viable option.&#10;3. Context: The context of a person's current situation can also influence their decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if someone is dressed in business attire and needs to arrive at a meeting on time, they may choose to take public transportation rather than walking.&#10;4. Discourse: Asking about open hours or the admission fee of a destination could indicate that a person plans to visit the location, and therefore may choose to take public transportation rather than walk. Additionally, asking where the entrance is located could suggest that the person has already decided on their mode of transportation.&#10;5. World Knowledge: The time of day, opening and closing times of destinations, and other world knowledge can also influence a person's decision to take public transportation or walk. For example, if a destination is closed when a person arrives, they may choose to walk to another location instead.">

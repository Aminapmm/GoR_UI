    <node id="In the story, Johnson feels a sense of comfort from the presence of his zit gun after he moves cushions for Caldwell, who is thick-voiced and bumped into by someone. This situation takes place in a venue where they are enjoying music, perfume, and dimmed lights with a bright spotlight above. The context suggests that this is a lounge or club, and the atmosphere is sensual and possibly romantic.&#10;&#10;The presence of the zit gun provides Johnson with a sense of security and confidence in this setting. Given that the zit guns are almost noiseless and can knock out a human or Venusian in seconds, it's likely that Johnson appreciates having the weapon as a means of self-defense. This feeling of comfort is particularly relevant given that there are hints of potential danger in the story, such as the mention of humans dying easily and no one questioning the motives of the killer.&#10;&#10;Overall, Johnson's fondness for the zit gun stems from its effectiveness as a weapon and its ability to provide him with a sense of safety and protection in potentially risky or threatening situations." />

Didn't mean to bump into you.&quot; Caldwell's voice was still thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of seconds.&#10; &#10; True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.&#10; &#10; The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle" />
    <node id=", perfume seemed to flow even more freely through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The curtain rose.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.&#10; &#10; Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened and became a rock.&#10; &#10; Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the spotlight as if by magic.&#10; &#10; Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. &quot;How—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shhh. Nobody knows.&quot;&#10; &#10; No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin—&#10;" />
    <node id=" beat of a Venusian rhumba, the notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room. Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses, perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him, aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.&#10; &#10; Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to recognize Caldwell.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?&quot; His voice was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a headwaiter was bowing to him.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll have a tarmur to start,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;How are the dreams tonight?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself will be here to do ze dreaming." />
    <node id=", humans died easily. No one questioned the motives of the killer.&#10; &#10; &quot;You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,&quot; Vee Vee said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not any longer,&quot; he laughed.&#10; &#10; &quot;You have decided them?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Every last one of them?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to them.&quot; He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.&#10; &#10; &quot;Zlock!&quot; Caldwell said, to the bartender. &quot;Make it snappy. Gotta have zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.&quot; Caldwell's voice was thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.&#10; &#10; &quot;I haven't seen him,&quot; Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. &quot;But I think he is" />
    <node id=" Her arms came up around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.&#10; &#10; &quot;What—&quot; he gasped.&#10; &#10; &quot;I had to do it now, darling,&quot; she answered. &quot;There may not be a later.&quot;&#10; &#10; Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of Venusians were attacking a man.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's Martin!&quot; Caldwell shouted. &quot;He is here!&quot;&#10; &#10; In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd. Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But there seemed to be an endless number of them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Vee Vee?&quot; Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had slid out of his sight.&#10; &#10; &quot;Vee Vee!&quot; Johnson's voice became a shout.&#10; &#10; &quot;To hell with the woman!&quot; Caldwell grunted" />
    <node id="In the story, Johnson's body parts are metaphorically whispering to him about their functions as he is in a tense situation. They are reporting what they are doing in order to prepare him for action. Here are the different parts of his body and their functions mentioned in the story:&#10;&#10;1. Skin - covered with sweat&#10;2. Adrenals - pouring forth adrenaline&#10;3. Pancreas - gearing up for action&#10;4. Thyroid - preparing him for action&#10;&#10;The little voices urge Johnson to take action, as they are excited and ready. However, Johnson tells them to be quiet, emphasizing that there is a time to hurry and a time to take action, but in this situation, hasty action could lead to disaster. The chorus of voices grows quiet, but they continue to remind Johnson to act quickly.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the various parts of Johnson's body are collectively expressing their readiness for action and urging him to do something in the tense situation he is in." />
    <node id=" &quot;I—&quot; Johnson whispered.&#10; &#10; &quot;I am your skin,&quot; another voice whispered. &quot;I am covered with sweat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We are your adrenals.

I....&quot;&#10; &#10; A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Be quiet!&quot; he said roughly.&#10; &#10; The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. &quot;Action, Master! Do something.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Quiet!&quot; Johnson ordered.&#10; &#10; &quot;But hurry. We are excited.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation, if action is taken before the time for it—if that time ever comes—we can all die.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Die?&quot; the chorus quavered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Now be quiet. When" />
    <node id=" sending tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold. In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the coldness now.&#10; &#10; Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you feel it, darling?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What is it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How would I know?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Please!&quot; Her voice grew sharp. &quot;I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Johnny! How do you know my name?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he is incognito on Venus?&quot; Her voice had a teasing quality in it.&#10; &#10; &quot;But—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Kar" />
    <node id=" &quot;Haven't you ever seen this before?&quot; he whispered.&#10; &#10; &quot;N—o.&quot; She shivered again. &quot;Oh, Johnny....&quot;&#10; &#10; Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting—for what? The whole situation was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself was not prepared to disagree.&#10; &#10; Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ... going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.&#10; &#10; The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep, perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He" />
    <node id=" back to her.&#10; &#10; Again she patted his arm. &quot;Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with me.&quot;&#10; &#10; A gray color came up inside his soul. &quot;But—but—&quot; His voice was suddenly weak.&#10; &#10; The fingers on his arm were very gentle. &quot;No harm will come to you. Am I not with you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's what I'm afraid of!&quot; he snapped at her. If he had had a choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they were—his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin—But Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?&#10; &#10; Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on" />
    <node id="1. Skin - The skin is covered with sweat, indicating that Johnson's body is preparing for action by increasing his sensitivity and readiness.&#10;2. Adrenals - The adrenals are pouring forth adrenaline, which is a hormone that prepares the body for the fight-or-flight response in tense situations.&#10;3. Pancreas - The pancreas is gearing up for action, possibly by releasing glucose into the bloodstream to provide energy.&#10;4. Thyroid - The thyroid is preparing him for action, as it plays a role in regulating the body's metabolic rate and response to stress.&#10;&#10;Johnson orders these parts of his body to be quiet because he recognizes that there is a time to hurry and a time to take action, but in this situation, hasty action could lead to disaster. He understands that the readiness of his body is necessary but must be controlled and used at the right moment. He wants to emphasize the need to hurry, as the situation requires quick thinking and reaction, but he also wants to prevent premature or rash actions that might jeopardize their safety." />
    <node id="The &quot;something else&quot; affecting Johnson and the Venusians in the Rooms of the Dreamers is never explicitly stated in the story. However, it can be inferred that it is some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present in the rooms, which may be responsible for the shared hallucinations and sensations experienced by the individuals within. This is suggested by the dream-like state that the Rooms induce, as well as the hypnotic trance that the Venusian watchers seem to be in. Additionally, Johnson describes a sense of his &quot;nerves being touched&quot; upon entering these places, which further implies an external influence at play.

    <node id=" by something else. It was this something else that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance. He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...&#10;  watching a space ship float in an endless void .&#10; &#10; As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer, the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe.&#10; &#10; All he saw was the space ship.&#10; &#10; It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.&#10; &#10; Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off stars. He had made models of space ships" />
    <node id=" in his mind. &quot;This is what you came to Venus to see. This ... this....&quot; The first voice went into silence. Another voice took its place.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is another damned vision!&quot; the second voice said. &quot;This ... this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity, can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We are not tricking you!&quot; the eyes hotly insisted. &quot;It is happening. We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You lied about the space ship!&quot; the second voice said.&#10; &#10; &quot;We did not lie about the space ship!&quot; the eyes insisted. &quot;When our master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I—&quot; Johnson whispered.&#10; &#10; &quot;I am your skin,&quot; another voice whispered. &quot;I am covered with sweat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We are" />
    <node id=" &#10; It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.&#10; &#10; The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.&#10; &#10; The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching hold of" />
    <node id=" She released the grip on his arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;But, didn't you see it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;See what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The space ship!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No. No.&quot; She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.&#10;&quot;I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact with my dream.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Your dream?&quot;&#10; &#10; He asked a question but she did not answer it. &quot;Sit down, darling, and look at your damned space ship.&quot; Her voice was a taut whisper of sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had not heard it before in this place.&#10; &#10; He thought about the space ship he had seen.&#10; &#10; The vision would not come.&#10; &#10; He shook his head and tried again.&#10; &#10; Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Vee Vee, Johnson's companion, suddenly left during the attack on the Venusians because she sensed that there may not be a later opportunity for them to be together.

Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Growing.&quot; The blue eyes were unafraid.&#10; &#10; Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman on him.&#10; &#10; There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.&#10; &#10; In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily.

I mean....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am very knowing,&quot; the girl said, smiling.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?&quot;&#10; &#10; For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then it came again, stronger. &quot;Aren't you here?&quot;&#10; &#10; Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his nose. &quot;My dear child ...&quot; he sputtered.&#10; &#10; &quot;I am not a child,&quot; she answered with a firm sureness that left no doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. &quot;And my name is Vee Vee.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Vee Vee?

    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn it!&quot; A human voice said.&#10; &#10; A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.&#10; &#10; Unger fell.&#10; &#10; He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking, body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.&#10; &#10; There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The silence went. Voices came.&#10; &#10; &quot;Who did that?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What happened?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!&quot; Anger marked the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. &quot;What—what happened? I was back in the lab on Earth—&quot; Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as if some pleasant dream had been interrupted.&#10; &#10; On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away" />
    <node id="Johnson is afraid that Vee Vee, the person who assures him that his secrets are safe, may actually pose a danger to him and his companions. This fear stems from the fact that she was asking about Martin, one of the individuals Johnson is trying to locate on Venus, and her sudden departure during an attack on the Venusians. Johnson interprets this behavior as a potential threat, as it suggests that Vee Vee might have perceived some danger associated with the attack. Furthermore, he feels that his life, as well as those of Caldwell and possibly Vee Vee herself, hang in the balance, making her presence crucial for their survival, especially given the hostile environment on Venus where humans are easily targeted and killed without repercussions. However, it's important to note that these conclusions are based on Johnson's assumptions and the information provided in the story, and further details may be revealed as the narrative progresses." />
    <node id="The nature of the force or sensation that Johnny Johnson and Vee are experiencing as they enter the Room of the Dreamer is never explicitly stated in the story.

He stretched himself flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.&#10; &#10; The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it.

    <node id="The experience of entering the Room of the Dreamer is one of sensory overload, with the protagonist Johnny Johnson noting the &quot;soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer&quot; and the hypnotic music that is initially inharmonious to human ears but eventually reveals its own unique rhythms and melodies. The room is cool and damp, reflecting the often rainy climate of Venus. Upon entering the room, Johnson senses unseen forces at play, which he suspects are responsible for the shared hallucinations experienced by those within. These forces may be some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present in the rooms, as suggested by the dream-like state and hypnotic trance that it induces. The Venusian watchers seem to be particularly susceptible to these forces, entering a trance-like state that is reminiscent of opium smokers. However, the exact nature of these forces remains unclear and speculative.&#10;&#10;The story also suggests that there may be some kind of telepathic or mind-reading abilities at play in this environment, as Vee seems to know Johnny's real name despite him being incognito on Venus. It is possible that the shared hallucinogenic state induced by the Room of the Dreamer allows her to access information from Johnson's subconscious mind, including his true name.&#10;&#10;Overall, entering the Room of the Dreamer is a surreal and otherworldly experience, characterized by its sensory overload, hypnotic atmosphere, and unseen forces at play. The story leaves much to the imagination, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions about the exact nature of these forces and abilities." />

This ... this....&quot; The first voice went into silence. Another voice took its place" />
    <node id="1. The woman's name is Vee Vee, which she claims is all she goes by, having &quot;just grown&quot; like Topsy.&#10;2. She is an Earth-like woman with a tan skin tone, abundant brown hair, and blue eyes the color of Earth's skies. This appearance stands out in a place where few humans venture without escorts.&#10;3. Vee Vee appears to have knowledge about Johnson, addressing him by name and acknowledging his identity as one of Earth's foremost scientists despite his incognito status on Venus.&#10;4. She is aware of Martin, another human whom Johnson is looking for on Venus, indicating that she may have some connection to their mission or the people they are seeking.&#10;5. Vee Vee suddenly leaves during an attack on the Venusians at the bar, which raises suspicion and makes Johnson question her motives and potential allegiance. This behavior also suggests that she might have perceived danger associated with the attack.&#10;6. Due to the hostile environment on Venus where humans are easily targeted and killed without repercussions, Johnson is concerned for his life as well as those of Caldwell and possibly Vee Vee herself, making her presence crucial for their survival.&#10;&#10;These elements create a mystery around Vee Vee's character, leaving readers curious about her true intentions, knowledge of Martin, and reasons for being in such a potentially dangerous environment without an escort." />
    <node id="ong. Johnson was at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. &quot;Tarmur,&quot; Johnson said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light, admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him, watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking itself.&#10; &#10; &quot;Beautiful, aren't they?&quot; a soft voice said. He glanced to his right. A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue, the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons. Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were" />
    <node id="1. &quot;Vee Vee&quot; is a Venusian woman who accompanies Johnson in the story. She is likely a resident or native of Venus who is familiar with the Rooms of the Dreamer and their effects. The significance of the chilly sensation and unknown forces that Johnson experiences upon entering the Room of the Dreamer is that they are indicative of some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present in the rooms, which may be responsible for the shared hallucinations and sensations experienced by those within. This is suggested by the dream-like state that the Rooms induce, as well as the hypnotic trance that the Venusian watchers seem to be in.&#10;2. Vee Vee seems to know Johnson's true identity because she recognizes him as one of Earth's foremost scientists, despite his attempts to remain incognito on Venus. It is possible that she has heard or read about him and his reputation, and therefore recognized him when he entered the room. Alternatively, it's possible that the shared hallucinogenic state induced by the Room of the Dreamer allowed her to access information from Johnson's subconscious mind, including his true name. However, these are only speculations and the story does not provide a definitive answer to this question." />
    <node id="Johnson is afraid that Vee Vee, who moments before had kissed him passionately, might be a potential threat to him and his companions. This fear arises from the realization that she had been asking about Martin, one of the individuals Johnson is trying to locate on Venus. The story suggests that this venue is a sensual and potentially dangerous place, with hints of violence and the presence of venomous Venusians. By saying &quot;That's what I'm afraid of!&quot;, Johnson expresses his concern that her actions and motivations might put him and his companions in harm's way.&#10;&#10;Caldwell mentions that Vee Vee had been asking about Martin because he is an important figure in their mission on Venus. The fact that she was asking questions about him raises suspicions about her true intentions and loyalties. It is unclear at this point whether she is a friend or foe, but Johnson's fear suggests that he believes she might be a threat to their safety. As the story progresses, more details may be revealed about Vee Vee's role in the narrative and her connection to Martin." />
    <node id="1. The reality of what Johnson is perceiving on Venus in terms of the levitating Venusian Buddha is not explicitly stated in the story. However, it seems that the Rooms of the Dreamer have some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present that induces shared hallucinations and sensations among the individuals within. This is suggested by Johnson's experience of his &quot;nerves being touched&quot; upon entering these places, as well as the hypnotic trance that the Venusian watchers seem to be in.&#10;&#10;The first voice that Johnson hears claims that the Buddha is truly levitating, while the second voice argues that it is not possible for anyone or anything to defy the laws of gravity and float upward. The eyes insist that they are reporting accurately and that they do not lie, but they also admit to having been out of focus when Johnson's master saw the space ship. It is unclear whether the Venusian Buddha is actually levitating or if it is a shared hallucination induced by the Rooms of the Dreamer.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Johnson's skin is covered with sweat and he is experiencing a chilly sensation also suggests that there may be some atmospheric or chemical agent present in the rooms that is affecting his physical senses. Therefore, it is possible that his eyes and skin are also being affected by this agent, leading to potentially unreliable perceptions of reality.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide a definitive answer as to whether the Venusian Buddha is truly levitating or if Johnson's senses are being deceived, it suggests that there may be some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present in the Rooms of the Dreamer that is affecting the perceptions and sensations of the individuals within." />
    <node id="1. The unknown forces that Johnson encounters upon entering the Room of the Dreamer are likely some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present in the rooms. These forces may be responsible for the shared hallucinations and sensations experienced by those within, including the hypnotic trance that the Venusian watchers seem to be in. Johnson describes a sense of his &quot;nerves being touched&quot; upon entering these places, which further implies an external influence at play. However, the exact nature of these forces remains unclear and speculative.&#10;2. The chilly sensation that Vee Vee experiences when they enter the Room of the Dreamer could be attributed to the pleasantly cool but damp climate of Venus, as suggested by the dream-like state and hypnotic trance that it induces. It is possible that this atmosphere affects different people in different ways, causing a range of sensations from chills to tingling feelings through the nose, as experienced by Johnson with the perfume of the Dreamer.&#10;3. The fact that Vee Vee recognizes Johnson's true identity suggests that she may be familiar with his reputation or background, and therefore able to identify him despite his attempts at anonymity on Venus. Alternatively, it is possible that the shared hallucinogenic state induced by the Room of the Dreamer allowed her to access information from Johnson's subconscious mind, including his true name. However, these are only speculations and the story does not provide a definitive answer to this question." />
    <node id="we can all die.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Die?&quot; the chorus quavered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go together.&quot;&#10; &#10; The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.&#10; &#10; &quot;I hear a whirring sound,&quot; his ears reported.&#10; &#10; &quot;Please!&quot; Johnson said.&#10; &#10; In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.&#10; &#10; &quot;Master, we are not lying!&quot; his eyes repeated.&#10; &#10; &quot;I sweat....&quot; his skin began.&#10; &#10; &quot;Watch Unger!&quot; Johnson said.&#10; &#10; The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yaaah!&quot; The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a Venusian being jarred out of his dream.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn it!&quot; A human voice said.&#10; &#10; A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Johnson is afraid of the unknown forces and chilly sensations present in the Room of the Dreamer, which he suspects are atmospheric or chemical agents responsible for the shared hallucinations experienced by those within. He is also wary of Vee Vee, as he fears she may pose a danger to him and his companions. Her behavior, such as asking about Martin and leaving during an attack on the Venusians, leads Johnson to believe that she might be a threat to their safety.&#10;2. Despite Vee Vee's attempts to make him more comfortable by moving cushions for him, Johnson feels uncomfortable around her due to his suspicions about her true intentions and loyalties. He is unsure whether she is a friend or foe, and the fact that she had been asking about Martin raises further questions. This unease makes it difficult for him to fully trust her, even in the dream-like state induced by the Room of the Dreamer." />

    <node id="1. The cause of Johnson's thoughts pounding while he is wide awake and alert is not explicitly stated in the story, but it seems to be related to the appearance of the space ship in his vision. This sight triggers memories of his childhood dreams about flight to the stars and models of spaceships he made.&#10;2. The object that has appeared in Johnson's vision, causing everything else to disappear from his reality, is a space ship. It appears suddenly, as if out of nowhere or nothingness, replacing all other sensory inputs like the room, sound of music, perfume, and other people. This causes him to focus solely on the space ship, which he finds to be the most beautiful sight he has ever seen in his life, filling him with a deep glow of wonder." />
    <node id="1. The great Unger is a person mentioned in the story who is known for his exceptional skill in dreaming. It is unclear from the story exactly who or what Unger is, but it is suggested that they are a powerful and renowned figure in the world of the Rooms of the Dreamers.&#10;2. The event about to occur in one hour or less is some kind of communal dreaming session or performance, for which Johnson has requested reservations. It is mentioned that the great Unger himself will be present to lead the dreaming, and that both Venusians and humans attend these events to experience the &quot;wonderful&quot; dreams. The Venusian bartender and the green drink called &quot;tarmur&quot; suggest that this event is taking place in a venue that caters to both human and Venusian clientele." />

That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might be something else. And he might be there.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!&quot; The headwaiter clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of sight.&#10; &#10; &quot;Say, I want to know more—&quot; Johnson began. His words were drowned in a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet, cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.&#10; &#10; In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation of what was to happen.&#10; &#10; The trumpets flared again.&#10; &#10; On one side of the place, a big" />
    <node id="1. Johnson's mysterious observation that caused his companion, Vee Vee, to break contact with her dream is not explicitly stated in the story. However, it can be inferred that it was related to the appearance of the space ship in his vision. This sight triggered memories of his childhood dreams about flight to the stars and models of spaceships he made.&#10;2. Vee Vee is now urging Johnson to look at a 'damned space ship' while hearing an unfamiliar high-speed whirring sound because she wants him to share in her experience, as she had been watching something else before he mentioned the space ship. The high-speed whirring sound could be related to the functioning or presence of the space ship, but this is not explicitly stated in the story." />
    <node id="The interaction between Johnson and the girl ends with them deciding to go watch the &quot;dreaming&quot; together. Despite her earlier attempt to use the Karmer grip on him, Johnson feels assured enough not to suspect any danger from her for the time being. However, he warns her that if she tries to use the nerve block grip again, he will break her arm. The girl, for her part, promises not to repeat her mistake.&#10;&#10;The conversation then shifts to Vee Vee's comment about breaking their victim's neck, which Johnson ignores and changes the subject. It is unclear from the story what Vee Vee means by this comment or whether it has any relevance to the plot.&#10;&#10;Overall, the interaction between Johnson and the girl suggests a tentative truce and an underlying sense of unease and suspicion, particularly on Johnson's part. While he seems willing to trust her for now, he remains vigilant and wary of any potential threats she may pose to him or his companions." />
    <node id=". &quot;You're the first man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shall we go watch the dreaming?&quot; He took the arm that still hung limp at her side and tucked it into his elbow.&#10; &#10; &quot;If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,&quot; he said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.&#10; &#10; &quot;I won't do it again,&quot; the girl said stoutly. &quot;I never make the same mistake twice.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Good,&quot; Johnson said.&#10; &#10; &quot;The second time we break our victim's neck,&quot; Vee Vee said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What a sweet, charming child you—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I told you before, I'm not a child.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Child vampire,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Let me finish my sentences before you interrupt.&quot;&#10; &#10; She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again" />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information on what happened to Vee Vee after she suddenly left during the attack on the Venusians. However, based on Johnson's fear for her safety and the hostile environment on Venus where humans are easily targeted and killed without repercussions, it is possible that she left to avoid danger or potential harm. Her sudden departure may have also been prompted by her desire to protect Johnson and Caldwell, given that her presence could be crucial for their survival.&#10;&#10;As for why Vee Vee left, the story suggests that she may have perceived some danger or threat associated with the attack on the Venusians. When asked about her motives for being at the gathering, she answered cryptically that she was &quot;growing,&quot; which could imply that she had a personal stake in the events unfolding on Venus. Additionally, her sudden departure during the attack may have been prompted by a need to attend to this personal stake or to ensure the safety of someone or something else.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide definitive answers to what happened to Vee Vee or why she left, it suggests that her departure was motivated by a desire to avoid danger and protect those around her." />
    <node id="The strange phenomenon occurring in the room where Johnson and others are present is the apparent levitation of a Venusian Dreamer named Unger. This is indicated by the fact that Unger is floating ten feet above the floor, and Johnson cannot see any wires or detect any known force lifting him. Additionally, the eyes of another individual in the room insist that they are reporting accurately and that Unger is indeed levitating, despite a second voice arguing that it is not possible for anything to defy the laws of gravity. The situation is further complicated by the presence of various voices representing different senses and bodily functions, adding to the surreal atmosphere of the room. The phenomenon causes an enraged reaction from one Venusian being, suggesting that it is a highly unusual and unexpected event." />
    <node id="1. The exact cause of Vee Vee's sudden fear is not explicitly stated in the story, but it can be inferred that it may have something to do with Johnson's behavior or observations while in the Room of the Dreamer. Specifically, Johnson sees a space ship in his vision, which triggers memories of his childhood dreams about flight to the stars and models of spaceships he made. This sight may have caused him to react in some way that alarmed Vee Vee, prompting her to break contact with her dream and grip his arm tightly.&#10;2. Additionally, Johnson's suspicions about Vee Vee's true intentions and loyalties, as well as her previous attempts to make him more comfortable by moving cushions for him, may have contributed to her fear. The fact that she had been asking about Martin also raises questions for Johnson, making it difficult for him to fully trust her even in the dream-like state induced by the Room of the Dreamer.&#10;3. It's possible that Vee Vee is worried about Johnson's safety or well-being, and is reacting out of concern for him. Alternatively, she may have some other reason for being afraid, such as a fear of being discovered or exposed in some way. However, these are only speculations and the story does not provide a definitive answer to this question." />
    <node id="1. &quot;Eve's way&quot; likely refers to seduction or manipulation, as opposed to the physical restraint of the Karmer grip. This is suggested by Vee Vee's use of flirtatious and teasing language, as well as Johnson's suspicion and unease in her presence.&#10;2. The semi-illumined Room of the Dreaming with circling ramps is a setting where individuals can experience something called &quot;the dreaming.&quot; It is unclear from the story what exactly &quot;the dreaming&quot; entails, but it appears to be a significant or noteworthy activity on Venus. The room's design, with tiered levels and open spaces, suggests that it is a large and important venue. The description of the room and its effects on Johnson's senses also indicate that it may be a place where sensory manipulation or hallucinations occur." />

Instead with the tips of her fingers she gently patted his arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;There, there, darling, relax,&quot; she said. &quot;I know a better way to get you than by using the Karmer grip.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What way?&quot;&#10; &#10; Her eyes sparkled. &quot;Eve's way,&quot; she answered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Um!&quot; Surprise sounded in his grunt. &quot;But apples don't grow on Venus.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.&quot;&#10; &#10; Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming, Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps rising up from an open space at the bottom.

From beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that sounded like lutes from heaven.&#10; &#10; Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.&#10; &#10; She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing it, she began to massage it.&#10; &#10; &quot;You—you—&quot; Hot anger and shock were in her voice. &quot;You're the first man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And you're the first woman who ever tried" />
    <node id="1. The decision made by Johnson and the lady (Vee Vee) to go see the dreaming is significant because it indicates their interest in and willingness to participate in a communal dreaming session led by the great Unger, a highly skilled dreamer. This suggests that they value the experience of shared dreams and are open to exploring altered states of consciousness.&#10;2. Based on the preparations being made, it can be inferred that some kind of dreaming performance or event is about to occur in the Rooms of the Dreamers. The presence of both human and Venusian attendees, as well as the great Unger himself, suggests that this event is a popular and well-regarded occasion for experiencing wonderful dreams. The atmospheric or chemical agents present in the rooms may induce shared hallucinations and sensations among the individuals within, creating a dream-like state that allows them to explore their subconscious minds together." />
    <node id="In this conversation, the person being addressed is Johnson, who is revealed by his reaction to Vee Vee's question about Martin. The speaker, Vee Vee, attempts to confirm Johnson's identity by addressing him by name and acknowledging his reputation as one of Earth's foremost scientists, despite his efforts to remain incognito on Venus. Additionally, she asks Johnson questions about Martin, indicating her knowledge of the mission or the people they are seeking, further solidifying her recognition of Johnson.&#10;&#10;The text states: &quot;That's what I'm afraid of!&quot; said Johnson in a low voice. He pushed her roughly from him. &quot;You were asking about Martin! Who are you? What do you want?&quot;&#10;&#10;This response from Johnson confirms that Vee Vee had asked about Martin, which she could only have known if she recognized or was connected to the mission involving Martin and Johnson. The fact that she knows these details suggests she is familiar with their objectives on Venus and, by extension, Johnson's identity as a key figure in this mission." />
    <node id="1. The various bodily functions whispering to Johnson are his skin, covered with sweat; his adrenals, pouring forth adrenaline; his pancreas, gearing up for action; and his thyroid, preparing him for action. These body parts are expressing their readiness for action and urging Johnson to do something in the tense situation he is in, as they collectively prepare him for the fight-or-flight response.&#10;2. Johnson tells them to be quiet because he recognizes that there is a time to hurry and a time to take action, but in this situation, hasty action could lead to disaster. He wants to emphasize the need to hurry, as the situation requires quick thinking and reaction, but he also wants to prevent premature or rash actions that might jeopardize their safety. The chorus of voices grows quiet, but they continue to remind Johnson to act quickly, indicating that his body is still ready for action and alert for potential dangers." />

The great Unger himself will be present to lead the dreaming, and both Venusians and humans attend these events to experience the &quot;wonderful&quot; dreams.&#10;3. The perfume of the Dreamer and the reactions of the people present suggest that this event is a popular and well-regarded occasion for experiencing shared dreams and hallucinations. The atmospheric or chemical agents present in the rooms may induce these sensations, creating a dream-like state that allows the individuals within to explore their subconscious minds together.&#10;4. Additionally, the fact that both Venusians and humans attend these events suggests that this venue caters to both clientele, as indicated by the Venusian bartender and the green drink called &quot;tarmur.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Vee Vee is a young Venusian woman who accompanies Johnson in the story, and she seems to know his true identity as one of Earth's foremost scientists. She recognizes him when he enters the Room of the Dreamer, suggesting that she may have heard or read about him and his reputation. Alternatively, it's possible that the shared hallucinogenic state induced by the Room of the Dreamer allowed her to access information from Johnson's subconscious mind, including his true name.&#10;2. Vee Vee is described as being very knowing, suggesting that she may be wise beyond her years or possess some form of extrasensory perception. This is further supported by her ability to sense danger or threats associated with the attack on the Venusians, causing her to leave suddenly during the chaos.&#10;3. Despite the potential dangers present in this space port city, Vee Vee does not seem to be disturbed or afraid. She remains calm and composed throughout their interactions, even joking and flirting with Johnson at times. This could indicate that she is a brave and confident individual who is unafraid of facing challenges or threats.&#10;4. Overall, Vee Vee is portrayed as an enigmatic and mysterious character who may possess hidden knowledge or abilities beyond what is immediately apparent. Her true motivations and intentions are never fully revealed in the story, leaving room for speculation and interpretation." />

They are at a venue where there is potential danger, with hints of violence and the presence of venomous Venusians.&#10;2. Vee Vee had been asking about Martin, an important figure in their mission on Venus, which raises suspicions about her true intentions and loyalties. Johnson expresses his concern that her actions might put him and his companions in harm's way by saying &quot;That's what I'm afraid of!&quot;.&#10;3. Caldwell has information that Martin is, or was, on Venus due to the girl asking for him. This leads Johnson to be cautious around Vee Vee, despite her earlier display of affection towards him.&#10;4. They make reservations for &quot;the dreaming&quot;, a sensory experience that seems popular among the attendees. Vee Vee becomes particularly interested when Johnson mentions seeing a spaceship in his childhood dreams and memories of making models of spaceships.&#10;5.

This fear arises from the realization that she had been asking about Martin, one of the individuals Johnson is trying to locate on Venus. The story suggests that this venue is a sensual and potentially dangerous place, with hints of violence and the presence of venomous Venusians. By saying &quot;That's what I'm afraid of!&quot;, Johnson expresses his concern that her actions and motivations might put him and his companions in harm's way.&#10;&#10;Caldwell mentions that Vee Vee had been asking about Martin because he is an important figure in their mission on Venus. The fact that she was asking questions about him raises suspicions about her true intentions and loyalties. It is unclear at this point whether she is a friend or foe, but Johnson's fear suggests that he believes she might be a threat to their safety. As the story progresses, more details may be revealed about Vee Vee's role in the narrative and her connection to Martin.">

However, based on Johnson's fear for her safety and the hostile environment on Venus where humans are easily targeted and killed without repercussions, it is possible that she left to avoid danger or potential harm. Her sudden departure may have also been prompted by her desire to protect Johnson and Caldwell, given that her presence could be crucial for their survival.&#10;&#10;As for why Vee Vee left, the story suggests that she may have perceived some danger or threat associated with the attack on the Venusians. When asked about her motives for being at the gathering, she answered cryptically that she was &quot;growing,&quot; which could imply that she had a personal stake in the events unfolding on Venus. Additionally, her sudden departure during the attack may have been prompted by a need to attend to this personal stake or to ensure the safety of someone or something else.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide definitive answers to what happened to Vee Vee or why she left, it suggests that her departure was motivated by a desire to avoid danger and protect those around her.">

This is suggested by Johnson's experience of his &quot;nerves being touched&quot; upon entering these places, as well as the hypnotic trance that the Venusian watchers seem to be in.&#10;&#10;The first voice that Johnson hears claims that the Buddha is truly levitating, while the second voice argues that it is not possible for anyone or anything to defy the laws of gravity and float upward. The eyes insist that they are reporting accurately and that they do not lie, but they also admit to having been out of focus when Johnson's master saw the space ship. It is unclear whether the Venusian Buddha is actually levitating or if it is a shared hallucination induced by the Rooms of the Dreamer.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Johnson's skin is covered with sweat and he is experiencing a chilly sensation also suggests that there may be some atmospheric or chemical agent present in the rooms that is affecting his physical senses. Therefore, it is possible that his eyes and skin are also being affected by this agent, leading to potentially unreliable perceptions of reality.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide a definitive answer as to whether the Venusian Buddha is truly levitating or if Johnson's senses are being deceived, it suggests that there may be some kind of atmospheric or chemical agent present in the Rooms of the Dreamer that is affecting the perceptions and sensations of the individuals within.">

Vee Vee is a young Venusian woman who accompanies Johnson in the story, and she seems to know his true identity as one of Earth's foremost scientists. She recognizes him when he enters the Room of the Dreamer, suggesting that she may have heard or read about him and his reputation. Alternatively, it's possible that the shared hallucinogenic state induced by the Room of the Dreamer allowed her to access information from Johnson's subconscious mind, including his true name.&#10;2. Vee Vee is described as being very knowing, suggesting that she may be wise beyond her years or possess some form of extrasensory perception. This is further supported by her ability to sense danger or threats associated with the attack on the Venusians, causing her to leave suddenly during the chaos.&#10;3. Despite the potential dangers present in this space port city, Vee Vee does not seem to be disturbed or afraid. She remains calm and composed throughout their interactions, even joking and flirting with Johnson at times.

Overall, Vee Vee is portrayed as an enigmatic and mysterious character who may possess hidden knowledge or abilities beyond what is immediately apparent. Her true motivations and intentions are never fully revealed in the story, leaving room for speculation and interpretation.">

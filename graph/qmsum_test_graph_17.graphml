    <node id="The Industrial Designer's working design method involves the use of a chip that produces a unique pattern when a button on the circuit is pressed, closing the circuit. This pattern is then sent to an LED (Light Emitting Diode) which illuminates in a specific way to indicate which button has been pressed. The designer mentioned using Morse code as an example of how this pattern could be created.&#10;&#10;The chip needs to be more intelligent than a standard one, as different TV brands use different patterns for the same button presses. By understanding these patterns and making the chip produce them accordingly, they aim to create a universal remote that can work with all TVs. The designer also mentioned that they could switch off the television using this method and save the setting, making it functional.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there is another LED used in this design, but it produces infrared light, which is invisible. This is likely for communication between the remote and the device being controlled (e.g., the TV).&#10;&#10;The designer also suggests using a normal light bulb instead of an LED for one of the indicators, so that users can visually confirm that they have pressed a button." />
    <node id=" because otherwise we won't make it .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay , sorry .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Is it fin Are you finished ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and" />
    <node id=" .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um that's connecting to all the components .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah , and this" />
    <node id=" uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns" />
    <node id=" Project Manager&#10;Content: But it's cool if it was green .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . It's it's not very important ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Green or red or whatever , it is cool . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: so yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So mm {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No . I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have" />
    <node id=" go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Changing the signal .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and then um it's working .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , that's the right uh option .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . Well uh the components .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , that's a bit technical , and" />
    <node id="Content: Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But this one is producing infrared light&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low ," />
    <node id="The main challenge in creating a specialized remote control for televisions priced at twenty-five Euros is that similar universal remotes are already available on the market for twenty Euros, and limiting the remote's functionality to only television control may further impact its competitiveness. However, focusing on simplicity and good usability can help address this challenge by making the remote more user-friendly and appealing to potential customers. Additionally, marketing the product with a motto like &quot;putting the fashion in electronics&quot; could help differentiate it from other remotes, emphasizing its unique design and style, and potentially justifying a slightly higher price point.&#10;&#10;Another important factor mentioned is that seventy-five percent of users find most remote controls ugly and would be willing to spend more money on an attractive one. The team should focus on designing an aesthetically pleasing remote control while ensuring it meets the desired price point, targeting the identified user preferences for a stylish design.&#10;&#10;In summary, addressing this challenge involves differentiating the product from competitors through simplicity, good usability, and unique design features that align with customer preferences, making the remote more appealing at its targeted price range of twenty-five Euros." />
    <node id=" out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros .

    <node id="1. Button Design and Layout: The team discussed having fewer buttons or integrating the buttons into the design to create a cleaner look. They also considered making the remote available in different colors as an option.&#10;&#10;2. Light Indicator: The industrial designer suggested using a normal light bulb instead of an LED for one of the indicators, so that users can visually confirm they have pressed a button. However, there were concerns about making it look cheap due to the limited budget.&#10;&#10;3. Infrared LED: Another LED was mentioned, which produces infrared light for communication between the remote and the device being controlled (e.g., the TV).&#10;&#10;4. Morse Code Patterns: The industrial designer explained using a chip that produces unique patterns when buttons are pressed, resembling Morse code. This would help create a universal remote capable of working with all TV brands.&#10;&#10;5. Mobile Phone Inspiration: The team drew inspiration from mobile phones for the design, particularly their use of light to indicate button presses in the dark. They saw this as a potential solution for both younger and elderly users who might struggle with visibility.&#10;&#10;Potential concerns include:&#10;- Keeping the design simple, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing while meeting the desired price point.&#10;- Ensuring good usability and compatibility with various TV brands.&#10;- Balancing the need for a compact size with ease of use and visibility for users of all ages." />

    <node id="1. Function of the Button and Chip: The button in this device is used to trigger a circuit closure when pressed, signaling the chip about which specific button has been activated. The chip then produces a unique pattern corresponding to the button press, as per its programming. This could be similar to Morse code patterns where each button generates a distinct sequence of signals.&#10;&#10;2. Communication with Infrared Bulb: After the chip receives information about the button press, it sends out a specific pattern to the infrared LED. The infrared bulb communicates this pattern to the device being controlled (like a TV), and this communication is facilitated through infrared light that is invisible to human eyes.&#10;&#10;In summary, when a button is pressed, it signals the chip which then generates a unique pattern. This pattern is sent to an infrared LED for communicating with the device being controlled, enabling the desired functionality (e.g., changing channels or adjusting volume)." />
    <node id="1. Usability: The usability of having a central device in a room that you can scream to from anywhere is questionable. While it might seem like a novel idea, practical issues arise, such as background noise, variations in volume and clarity of speech, and potential privacy concerns. The Industrial Designer mentioned they weren't sure how this would work, indicating they may need more information or research on the concept to determine its feasibility and usability.&#10;   &#10;2. Implementation: Although it is ultimately the Industrial Designer's job to figure out the implementation details, there were mixed opinions from the team regarding this feature. The User Interface designer expressed concern about whether it would be very usable, focusing on making the remote more user-friendly overall. Marketing content creators liked the idea but wondered if it was reachable or fancy enough to attract customers.&#10;   &#10;3. Feasibility: There was no clear consensus on whether this feature is feasible to realize. The Industrial Designer mentioned they didn't read about speech recognition technology, which may be necessary for implementing this feature. Project Managers suggested that integrating such technology might not be very expensive but did not make a definitive statement regarding its feasibility.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the team has mixed opinions on the usability and feasibility of having a central device in a room that you can scream to from anywhere. While some members find it an interesting concept, others have concerns about its practicality, usability, and technical implementation. Further research and discussion are required to determine if this feature aligns with customer preferences, product differentiation goals, and the remote's targeted price range." />

    <node id="The unique feature that this modern television has is the ability to search for its own pattern, eliminating the need for users to find their television or specific codes. This is achieved through the use of a more intelligent chip in the remote control. When a button on the remote is pressed, the chip produces a unique pattern that resembles Morse code. This pattern is then sent to an LED (Light Emitting Diode) which illuminates in a specific way to indicate which button has been pressed. The television's receiver unit can interpret this pattern, allowing it to identify the correct remote control and pair with it. This feature allows for easier setup and use of the universal remote control, as users do not have to manually search for their TV brand or input codes." />

    <node id="The industrial designer's working design involves pressing a button that closes a circuit and signals a chip about which specific button has been activated. The chip then produces a unique pattern corresponding to the button press, similar to Morse code patterns. This pattern is sent to an LED (Light Emitting Diode) display, indicating visibly which button has been pressed. Additionally, there is another infrared LED used for communication between the remote and the device being controlled (e.g., the TV).

    <node id="1. Color Options: The team considered offering different color options for the remote control, including possibly using a green color when buttons are pressed to provide visual confirmation. However, concerns about battery life and visibility were raised. Another suggestion was to use a normal light bulb instead of an LED for one of the indicators, but there were concerns about making it look cheap due to the limited budget.&#10;&#10;2. Unique Shape Considerations: The team drew inspiration from mobile phones for the design, particularly their use of light to indicate button presses in the dark. This could be a potential solution for both younger and elderly users who might struggle with visibility. There was also discussion about making the whole remote control become green if buttons are pressed, finding it cool, but there were concerns about battery life and visibility mentioned by other team members.&#10;&#10;Potential concerns include keeping the design simple, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing while meeting the desired price point, ensuring good usability and compatibility with various TV brands, and balancing the need for a compact size with ease of use and visibility for users of all ages. The main challenge is to differentiate the product from competitors through simplicity, good usability, and unique design features that align with customer preferences, making the remote more appealing at its targeted price range of twenty-five Euros. By focusing on designing an aesthetically pleasing remote control while ensuring it meets the desired price point, targeting the identified user preferences for a stylish design, the team can create a specialized remote control for televisions that stands out from other remotes on the market." />

    <node id="1. The conversation started with the Project Manager, User Interface (UI), Industrial Designer, and Marketing discussing the design of simple buttons for a project. They decided on the layout and number of buttons.&#10;2. The group then broke for lunch. During the lunch break, there were some background sounds and vocals from Marketing, but no clear or meaningful conversation was shared in the transcript.&#10;3. After lunch, the Project Manager confirmed the length of the second meeting and asked Marketing and UI for their names, which they provided.&#10;4. The Industrial Designer brought up the idea of having only four buttons due to the target audience being both younger people who prefer internet use and older people who often use teletext. They decided to keep the design simple with one level of buttons.&#10;5. The User Interface Content mentioned that, despite having fewer buttons, the design should be prioritized and integrated into the button layout. Everyone agreed.&#10;6. Later in the conversation, there was an apparent change or decision made regarding the project, but the transcript does not provide enough context to understand the specifics of this change.&#10;7. The User Interface Content suggested making the device more modern by incorporating features similar to mobile phones. Everyone agreed with this idea as well.&#10;8. Towards the end of the conversation, there were several vocal sounds and filler words without any clear or meaningful discussion.&#10;9. The Project Manager asked if a decision had been made about something, to which Marketing responded &quot;changes.&quot; However, the transcript does not provide enough context to understand what changes they were referring to.&#10;10. The User Interface Content mentioned that this change would require making some nice features, and the Industrial Designer agreed.&#10;&#10;In summary, during this conversation, the team discussed the design of simple buttons for their project, decided on the layout, broke for lunch, and continued the discussion after lunch by considering their target audience and incorporating a modern design with limited buttons. There were also some unclear decisions or changes made towards the end of the conversation. The lunch break itself did not include any significant or clear discussions." />

    <node id="The team is considering using LEDs not only on but around and inside the buttons of the remote control for several reasons. First, LEDs can serve as indicators that a button has been pressed, providing tactile feedback to users. This is why the industrial designer suggested using a normal light bulb instead of an LED, to ensure users can visually confirm they have pressed a button. However, LEDs are more cost-effective and compact than traditional light bulbs.&#10;&#10;Second, LEDs can produce infrared light for communication between the remote and the device being controlled, such as a TV. This is different from visible light produced by LEDs used as indicators, and it allows the remote to send signals to the device without interfering with human vision.&#10;&#10;Third, using LEDs around and inside the buttons can make the design more visually appealing and modern, which could help attract customers. The team drew inspiration from mobile phones for the design, particularly their use of light to indicate button presses in the dark. This feature could benefit both younger and elderly users who might struggle with visibility.&#10;&#10;However, there are concerns about making the design look cheap due to budget limitations, so using LEDs around and inside the buttons should be balanced with cost considerations. Additionally, ensuring good usability and compatibility with various TV brands is essential, and the chip producing unique patterns when buttons are pressed could help achieve this goal." />
    <node id="1. Based on the discussion, using a green color for the indicator when buttons are pressed could provide a visible confirmation to users that they have pressed a button. However, concerns about battery life and visibility were raised. Therefore, if green is used, it should be balanced with energy efficiency and adequate lighting conditions.&#10;&#10;2. Another suggestion was to use a normal light bulb instead of an LED for one of the indicators, but there were concerns about making it look cheap due to the limited budget. If a traditional light bulb is considered, care should be taken to ensure that it fits within the overall design aesthetic and price range without compromising quality.&#10;&#10;3. The team also drew inspiration from mobile phones for the design, particularly their use of light to indicate button presses in the dark. This could be a potential solution for both younger and elderly users who might struggle with visibility. Using LEDs around and inside the buttons can make the design more visually appealing and modern while serving as indicators that a button has been pressed.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, incorporating green color for the indicator when buttons are pressed can be beneficial, but it should be balanced with energy efficiency and lighting conditions. Using traditional light bulbs or LEDs around and inside the buttons can serve as indicators and enhance the visual appeal of the remote control. The choice of colors and lighting elements should align with the desired price point, targeting user preferences for a stylish design that stands out from other remotes on the market." />

    <node id="Based on the conversation between the marketing content speaker, industrial designer, and project manager, the button's indicator light should be a normal light bulb, which provides a more visible confirmation to users that they have pressed a button compared to an LED. There was no strong preference for the indicator to be green, but rather easily visible. However, the team is still considering different options for using colors as visual indicators for the device's status.&#10;&#10;The industrial designer mentioned that pressing the button would close a circuit and signal a chip about which specific button has been activated, resulting in a unique pattern on the LED display indicating the pressed button. While there were discussions about using an additional infrared LED for communication between the remote and the controlled device, no explicit mention was made regarding the location of the normal light bulb indicator.&#10;&#10;Considering the need for visibility, the normal light bulb indicator should be located in a position that is easily noticeable by users when they interact with the button, such as directly above or below it. The primary goal is to ensure users can quickly and clearly see that their button press has been registered, making the user experience more intuitive and efficient." />
    <node id="The User Interface and Industrial Designer content believe that using LCD for a remote control priced at twelve and a half Euros, specifically one with limited functionality focusing on TV functions only, is not usable.

This is achieved through the use of a more intelligent chip in the remote control. When a button on the remote is pressed, the chip produces a unique pattern that resembles Morse code. This pattern is then sent to an LED (Light Emitting Diode) which illuminates in a specific way to indicate which button has been pressed. The television's receiver unit can interpret this pattern, allowing it to identify the correct remote control and pair with it.

This is achieved through the use of a more intelligent chip in the remote control. When a button on the remote is pressed, the chip produces a unique pattern that resembles Morse code. This pattern is then sent to an LED (Light Emitting Diode) which illuminates in a specific way to indicate which button has been pressed. The television's receiver unit can interpret this pattern, allowing it to identify the correct remote control and pair with it. This feature allows for easier setup and use of the universal remote control, as users do not have to manually search for their TV brand or input codes.">

The conversation started with the Project Manager, User Interface (UI), Industrial Designer, and Marketing discussing the design of simple buttons for a project. They decided on the layout and number of buttons.&#10;2. The group then broke for lunch. During the lunch break, there were some background sounds and vocals from Marketing, but no clear or meaningful conversation was shared in the transcript.&#10;3. After lunch, the Project Manager confirmed the length of the second meeting and asked Marketing and UI for their names, which they provided.&#10;4. The Industrial Designer brought up the idea of having only four buttons due to the target audience being both younger people who prefer internet use and older people who often use teletext. They decided to keep the design simple with one level of buttons.&#10;5. The User Interface Content mentioned that, despite having fewer buttons, the design should be prioritized and integrated into the button layout. Everyone agreed.&#10;6. Later in the conversation, there was an apparent change or decision made regarding the project, but the transcript does not provide enough context to understand the specifics of this change.&#10;7. The User Interface Content suggested making the device more modern by incorporating features similar to mobile phones. Everyone agreed with this idea as well.&#10;8. Towards the end of the conversation, there were several vocal sounds and filler words without any clear or meaningful discussion.&#10;9. The Project Manager asked if a decision had been made about something, to which Marketing responded &quot;changes.&quot; However, the transcript does not provide enough context to understand what changes they were referring to.&#10;10. The User Interface Content mentioned that this change would require making some nice features, and the Industrial Designer agreed.&#10;&#10;In summary, during this conversation, the team discussed the design of simple buttons for their project, decided on the layout, broke for lunch, and continued the discussion after lunch by considering their target audience and incorporating a modern design with limited buttons. There were also some unclear decisions or changes made towards the end of the conversation. The lunch break itself did not include any significant or clear discussions.">

    <edge source="The team is considering using LEDs not only on but around and inside the buttons of the remote control for several reasons. First, LEDs can serve as indicators that a button has been pressed, providing tactile feedback to users. This is why the industrial designer suggested using a normal light bulb instead of an LED, to ensure users can visually confirm they have pressed a button. However, LEDs are more cost-effective and compact than traditional light bulbs.&#10;&#10;Second, LEDs can produce infrared light for communication between the remote and the device being controlled, such as a TV. This is different from visible light produced by LEDs used as indicators, and it allows the remote to send signals to the device without interfering with human vision.&#10;&#10;Third, using LEDs around and inside the buttons can make the design more visually appealing and modern, which could help attract customers. The team drew inspiration from mobile phones for the design, particularly their use of light to indicate button presses in the dark. This feature could benefit both younger and elderly users who might struggle with visibility.&#10;&#10;However, there are concerns about making the design look cheap due to budget limitations, so using LEDs around and inside the buttons should be balanced with cost considerations. Additionally, ensuring good usability and compatibility with various TV brands is essential, and the chip producing unique patterns when buttons are pressed could help achieve this goal." target="1. Based on the discussion, using a green color for the indicator when buttons are pressed could provide a visible confirmation to users that they have pressed a button. However, concerns about battery life and visibility were raised. Therefore, if green is used, it should be balanced with energy efficiency and adequate lighting conditions.&#10;&#10;2. Another suggestion was to use a normal light bulb instead of an LED for one of the indicators, but there were concerns about making it look cheap due to the limited budget. If a traditional light bulb is considered, care should be taken to ensure that it fits within the overall design aesthetic and price range without compromising quality.&#10;&#10;3.

This could be a potential solution for both younger and elderly users who might struggle with visibility. Using LEDs around and inside the buttons can make the design more visually appealing and modern while serving as indicators that a button has been pressed.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, incorporating green color for the indicator when buttons are pressed can be beneficial, but it should be balanced with energy efficiency and lighting conditions. Using traditional light bulbs or LEDs around and inside the buttons can serve as indicators and enhance the visual appeal of the remote control. The choice of colors and lighting elements should align with the desired price point, targeting user preferences for a stylish design that stands out from other remotes on the market.">

    <node id="In the passage, Oak makes a sincere and passionate promise towards Miss Everdene despite her concerns about their relationship. Oak is in love with Bathsheba, but she is hesitant to be with him because of their different social statuses and her independent nature. However, Oak is undeterred and tells her that he will continue to love her, long for her, and &quot;KEEP WANTING YOU till I die.&quot; He assures her that he will never despise her and that his love for her is not dependent on her responding to his feelings. Despite Bathsheba's reluctance, Oak's words are filled with genuine emotion, showing his sincerity and passion towards her." />

(Calling&#10;one's self merely Somebody, without giving a name, is not to be taken&#10;as an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it springs&#10;from a refined modesty, of which townspeople, with their cards and&#10;announcements, have no notion whatever.)&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was out.  The voice had evidently been hers.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you come in, Mr. Oak?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, thank 'ee,&quot; said Gabriel, following her to the fireplace.  &quot;I've&#10;brought a lamb for Miss Everdene.  I thought she might like one to&#10;rear; girls do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She might,&quot; said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; &quot;though she's only a visitor&#10;here. " />

And from a quiet modesty that would have&#10;become a vestal, which seemed continually to impress upon him that he&#10;had no great claim on the world's room, Oak walked unassumingly and&#10;with a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the&#10;shoulders.  This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he&#10;depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his&#10;capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.&#10;&#10;He had just reached the time of life at which &quot;young&quot; is ceasing to&#10;be the prefix of &quot;man&quot; in speaking of one.  He was at the brightest&#10;period of masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were&#10;clearly separated: he had passed the time during which the influence&#10;of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse,&#10;and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united&#10;again, in the character of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and&#10;family" />

His dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in&#10;which Oak waited for the girl's presence, that the farmer was quite&#10;struck with the resemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at&#10;the dog.  However, he continued to watch through the hedge for her&#10;regular coming, and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened&#10;without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself.  Oak&#10;had nothing finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able to&#10;frame love phrases which end where they begin; passionate tales--&#10;&#10;&#10;         --Full of sound and fury&#10;      --Signifying nothing--&#10;&#10;&#10;he said no word at all.&#10;&#10;By making inquiries he found that the girl's name was Bathsheba&#10;Everdene, and that the cow would go dry in about seven days.

    <node id="The narrative suggests that the girl lay down backwards on her pony in such a manner as a way to pass through a part of the path where the boughs were spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet, making it impossible to ride erect beneath them.

The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of&#10;a kingfisher--its noiselessness that of a hawk.  Gabriel's eyes had&#10;scarcely been able to follow her.  The tall lank pony seemed used to&#10;such doings, and ambled along unconcerned.  Thus she passed under the&#10;level boughs.&#10;&#10;The performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head&#10;and its tail, and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having&#10;ceased with the passage of the plantation, she began to adopt&#10;another, even more obviously convenient than the first.  She had&#10;no side-saddle, and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the&#10;smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways.  Springing to&#10;her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying&#10;herself that nobody was in sight, she seated herself in the manner&#10;demanded by the saddle, though hardly expected of the woman, and&#10;trotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill.&#10;&#10;Oak was amused, perhaps a little" />

An hour passed, the girl&#10;returned, properly seated now, with a bag of bran in front of&#10;her.  On nearing the cattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a&#10;milking-pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off.&#10;The boy led away the horse, leaving the pail with the young woman.&#10;&#10;Soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular&#10;succession from within the shed, the obvious sounds of a person&#10;milking a cow.  Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand, and waited&#10;beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill.&#10;&#10;She came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her knee. The left&#10;arm was extended as a balance, enough of it being shown bare to make&#10;Oak wish that the event had happened in the summer, when the whole&#10;would have been revealed.  There was a bright air and manner about&#10;her" />

Here he ensconced himself, and peeped through the&#10;loophole in the direction of the rider's approach.&#10;&#10;She came up and looked around--then on the other side of the hedge.&#10;Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when&#10;an unexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for&#10;the present.  The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected the&#10;plantation.  It was not a bridle-path--merely a pedestrian's track,&#10;and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven&#10;feet above the ground, which made it impossible to ride erect beneath&#10;them.  The girl, who wore no riding-habit, looked around for a&#10;moment, as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view,&#10;then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back, her&#10;head over its tail, her feet against its shoulders, and her eyes to&#10;the sky.

Without throwing a&#10;Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid, let it be said that here criticism&#10;checked itself as out of place, and looked at her proportions with a&#10;long consciousness of pleasure.  From the contours of her figure in&#10;its upper part, she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders; but&#10;since her infancy nobody had ever seen them.  Had she been put into&#10;a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush.  Yet&#10;she was not a shy girl by any means; it was merely her instinct to&#10;draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do&#10;it in towns.&#10;&#10;That the girl's thoughts hovered about her face and form" />

Even its position terrestrially is&#10;one of the elements of a new interest, and for no particular reason&#10;save that the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again&#10;into the plantation.  Lingering and musing here, he heard the steps of&#10;a horse at the foot of the hill, and soon there appeared in view an&#10;auburn pony with a girl on its back, ascending by the path leading&#10;past the cattle-shed.  She was the young woman of the night before.&#10;Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having&#10;lost in the wind; possibly she had come to look for it.  He hastily&#10;scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found&#10;the hat among the leaves.  Gabriel" />

The idea of such a slight wind catching it.&quot;&#10;&#10;The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and was encased in a&#10;tight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely uniform from eyes&#10;to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour, her&#10;long back being mathematically level.  The other was spotted, grey&#10;and white. " />

A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill&#10;whereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the&#10;sunshine of a few days earlier.&#10;&#10;Norcombe Hill--not far from lonely Toller-Down--was one of the spots&#10;which suggest" />

By the side of the&#10;latter a steaming bran-mash stood in a bucket.  One of the women was&#10;past middle age.  Her companion was apparently young and graceful;&#10;he could form no decided opinion upon her looks, her position being&#10;almost beneath his eye, so that he saw her in a bird's-eye view, as&#10;Milton's Satan first saw Paradise.  She wore no bonnet or hat, but&#10;had enveloped herself in a large cloak, which was carelessly flung&#10;over her head as a covering.&#10;&#10;&quot;There, now we'll go home,&quot; said the elder of the two, resting her&#10;knuckles upon her hips, and looking at their goings-on as a whole.&#10;&quot;I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now.

    <node id="The significance of Gabriel's physical appearance is that it is exactly average, falling between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot as depicted in a window of his church. This reflects his character, which is also average or neutral in many ways - he is not particularly remarkable or memorable. The twopence he uses to let the young woman pass is significant because it is an appreciable amount that represents an infringement on a day's wages, yet the young woman initially treats it as an insignificant sum when she fails to thank Gabriel for his help. This highlights her initial character and sets up the conflict between them, as well as foreshadowing the later dispute over twopence at the toll-gate." />

The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden&#10;seemed to think so too, for she carelessly glanced over him, and told&#10;her man to drive on.  She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on&#10;a minute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt&#10;none, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we&#10;know how women take a favour of that kind.&#10;&#10;The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle" />
    <node id="acquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he, in considerateness,&#10;turned away his head.&#10;&#10;The sympathetic man still looked the other way, and wondered when she&#10;would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again.&#10;He heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the&#10;breeze, and looked.  She had gone away.&#10;&#10;With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to&#10;his work.&#10;&#10;Five mornings and evenings passed.  The young woman came regularly to&#10;milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one, but never allowed&#10;her vision to stray in the direction of Oak's person.  His want of&#10;tact had deeply offended her--not by seeing what he could not help,&#10;but by letting her know that he had seen it.  For, as without law&#10;there is no sin, without eyes there is no indecorum; and she appeared&#10;to feel that Gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman&#10;without her own connivance.  It was food for great regret with him;&#10;it was also a _contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he&#10;had experienced" />

It was a difference concerning twopence between the&#10;persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mis'ess's niece is upon the top of the things, and she says that's&#10;enough that I've offered ye, you great miser, and she won't pay any&#10;more.&quot;  These were the waggoner's words.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well; then mis'ess's niece can't pass,&quot; said the turnpike-keeper,&#10;closing the gate.&#10;&#10;Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants, and fell into&#10;a reverie.  There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably&#10;insignificant.

On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution--a&#10;fine January morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible&#10;to make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an occasional&#10;gleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday&#10;basket, and stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the&#10;aunt--George, the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great&#10;concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking.&#10;&#10;Gabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with&#10;strange meditation.  At evening he had fancifully traced it down the&#10;chimney to the spot of its origin--seen the hearth and Bathsheba&#10;beside it--beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had&#10;worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included&#10;in the compass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of&#10;his love a" />

He had leased the land, stocked it with two hundred sheep, and was now responsible for their welfare, particularly during lambing. The narrative highlights Oak's careful attention to his flock, describing his deliberate movements as he tends to them throughout the night, reflecting his expertise and deep understanding of his occupation as a shepherd.&#10;&#10;Inside the hut, Oak exhibits a quiet-energy while attending to various tasks such as checking on the ewes, assisting in the birthing process, and caring for newborn lambs. He carries a lantern to illuminate his way as he moves around the enclosure, and his steady swings and turns among the flock display elements of grace, demonstrating his comfort and skill in this environment. After completing his rounds, Oak retires to the hut, where he sleeps on a simple couch near a stove that keeps him warm during the cold winter nights.&#10;&#10;Farmer Oak's movements and actions throughout the narrative illustrate his deep connection to his work as a shepherd and his devotion to ensuring the success of his new farming venture." />

The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of&#10;his ewes, and sheep having been his speciality from his youth, he&#10;wisely refrained from deputing the task of tending them at this&#10;season to a hireling or a novice.&#10;&#10;The wind continued to beat about the corners of the hut, but the&#10;flute-playing ceased.  A rectangular space of light appeared in the&#10;side of the hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak's&#10;figure.  He carried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door&#10;behind him, came forward and busied himself about this nook of the&#10;field for nearly twenty minutes, the lantern light appearing and&#10;disappearing here and there, and brightening him or darkening him&#10;as he stood before or behind it.&#10;&#10;Oak's motions, though they had a quiet-energy, were slow, and their&#10;deliberateness accorded well with his occupation.

During the twelvemonth preceding this time he had been enabled&#10;by sustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease&#10;the small sheep-farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion, and stock&#10;it with two hundred sheep.  Previously he had been a bailiff for a&#10;short time, and earlier still a shepherd only, having from his&#10;childhood assisted his father in tending the flocks of large&#10;proprietors, till old Gabriel sank to rest.&#10;&#10;This venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of farming as master&#10;and not as man, with an advance of sheep not yet paid for, was a&#10;critical juncture with Gabriel Oak, and he recognised his position&#10;clearly.  The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of&#10;his e" />

He returned to the hut, bringing in&#10;his arms a new-born lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for&#10;a full-grown sheep, united by a seemingly inconsiderable membrane&#10;about half the substance of the legs collectively, which constituted&#10;the animal's entire body just at present.&#10;&#10;The little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small&#10;stove, where a can of milk was simmering.  Oak extinguished the&#10;lantern by blowing into it and then pinching the snuff, the cot being&#10;lighted by a candle suspended by a twisted wire.  A rather hard&#10;couch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly down, covered&#10;half the floor of this little habitation, and here the young man&#10;stretched himself along, loosened his woollen cravat, and closed his&#10;eyes.  In about the time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would&#10;have decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.&#10;&#10;The inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and&#10;alluring, and the scarlet" />

Yet, although if&#10;occasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a&#10;dash as can the men of towns who are more to the manner born, his&#10;special power, morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing&#10;little or nothing to momentum as a rule.&#10;&#10;A close examination of the ground hereabout, even by the wan&#10;starlight only, revealed how a portion of what would have been&#10;casually called a wild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for&#10;his great purpose this winter.  Detached hurdles thatched with straw&#10;were stuck into the ground at various scattered points, amid and&#10;under which the whitish forms of his meek ewes moved and rustled.&#10;The ring of the sheep-bell, which had been silent during his absence,&#10;recommenced, in tones that had more mellowness than clearness, owing&#10;to an increasing growth of surrounding wool.

Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating&#10;hole--of which there was one on each side of the hut.&#10;&#10;Gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door&#10;closed one of these must be kept open--that chosen being always on&#10;the side away from the wind.  Closing the slide to windward, he&#10;turned to open the other; on second thoughts the farmer considered&#10;that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two,&#10;till the temperature of the hut was a little raised.  He sat down.&#10;&#10;His head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself&#10;weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak&#10;decided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall&#10;asleep.

At last he felt cold, and shaking an extra quantity of&#10;bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more&#10;fuel upon the stove.

Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it;--did he,&#10;poor dear!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Oak to the voice, &quot;but George was walking&#10;on behind me with a temper as mild as milk.&quot;&#10;&#10;Almost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was seized with a misgiving&#10;as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer. Nobody appeared, and&#10;he heard the person retreat among the bushes.&#10;&#10;Gabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought small furrows into&#10;his forehead by sheer force of reverie.

    <node id="Gabriel's action of giving twopence to the gatekeeper to let the red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden pass is significant because it sets up the conflict between them and foreshadows the later dispute over twopence at the toll-gate. The fact that Gabriel is willing to give up an appreciable amount of money, which represents an infringement on a day's wages, shows his generosity and kindness, while the maiden's initial lack of gratitude highlights her self-centeredness and vanity. This interaction also serves to contrast their characters and set up the dynamics of their relationship throughout the narrative." />
    <node id=" inference was irresistible by&#10;Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though he fain would&#10;have been.  There was no necessity whatever for her looking in the&#10;glass.  She did not adjust her hat, or pat her hair, or press a&#10;dimple into shape, or do one thing to signify that any such intention&#10;had been her motive in taking up the glass.  She simply observed&#10;herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her&#10;thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which&#10;men would play a part--vistas of probable triumphs--the smiles being&#10;of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won.&#10;Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was&#10;so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any&#10;part in them at all.&#10;&#10;The waggoner's steps were heard returning.

The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if&#10;a little more pronounced, dignity if a little less.  Rays of male&#10;vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural&#10;districts; she brushed hers with her hand, as if Gabriel had been&#10;irritating its pink surface by actual touch, and the free air of her&#10;previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase&#10;of itself.  Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not at all.&#10;&#10;&quot;I found a hat,&quot; said Oak.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is mine,&quot; said she, and, from a sense of proportion, kept down to&#10;a small smile an inclination to laugh distinctly: &quot;it flew away last&#10;night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One o'clock this morning?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--it was.&quot;  She was surprised.  &quot;How did you know?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was here.&quot;&#10;" />

    <node id="The girl on the auburn pony is the same young woman who had encountered Gabriel Oak the previous night when she sought his help with her runaway horse. She is identified as such when the narrator notes that Oak &quot;instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind.&quot;&#10;&#10;As for why she might have visited the plantation, the text provides some clues. Given that she is not wearing a riding-habit and that she looks around to ensure that all humanity is out of view before assuming her unusual position on the pony's back, it is possible that she is trying to avoid being seen. The fact that she had lost her hat in the wind the previous night suggests that she might have come back to look for it, which Oak eventually finds and takes back with him. However, the text does not provide definitive evidence for this theory, and so it remains a possibility rather than a certainty." />
    <node id="Based on the description provided, Farmer Oak is a young man of sound judgment and reliable character during working days. He has easy movements, wears appropriate clothing, and demonstrates general good behavior. On Sundays, however, he adopts a more laid-back attitude, attending church but privately yawning during the sermon and thinking about dinner. This suggests that Oak may be somewhat indifferent or uninterested in religious matters, preferring to focus on more worldly concerns.&#10;&#10;Despite this apparent lack of spiritual engagement, Oak is described as having a &quot;quiet modesty&quot; that sets him apart from others. He carries himself with humility and does not seek attention or validation based on his appearance. Instead, he seems to value his capacity for hard work and ability to &quot;wear well&quot; over superficial appearances.&#10;&#10;At the time of the narrative, Oak is no longer a young man but has not yet reached middle age. He is at the peak of his masculine growth, with his intellect and emotions clearly separated, allowing him to make rational decisions and approach problems with a level head. This maturity and stability in his personality make him an effective and skilled shepherd, as evidenced by his careful attention to his flock during the lambing season." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK--AN INCIDENT&#10;&#10;&#10;When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they&#10;were within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were&#10;reduced to chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them,&#10;extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch&#10;of the rising sun.&#10;&#10;His Christian name was Gabriel, and on working days he was a young&#10;man of sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good&#10;character.  On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to&#10;postponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella: upon the&#10;whole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space&#10;of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of&#10;the parish and the drunken section,--that is, he went to church, but&#10;yawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene&#10;creed, and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to&#10;be listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood&#10;in the scale of public opinion, when his friends and critics were in&#10;tantrums" />
    <node id="1. Gabriel Oak makes an awkward advance towards the young woman by holding her hand for too long and commenting on its softness. She then teasingly offers to let him kiss her hand, which he does. This incident leaves her feeling uncomfortable and indecorous, as she believes Oak's actions imply that she is an improper woman.&#10;2. As a result, the young woman avoids Gabriel Oak's presence during her subsequent visits to his farm. She is offended by his lack of tact in making her feel indecent, despite his good intentions. This creates a rift in their relationship and causes her to keep her distance from him until she feels more comfortable." />
    <node id="1. Gabriel's impression of the girl as a beauty is initially based on her physical appearance, with &quot;a face which any father might have been proud to acknowledge as his daughter's.&quot; However, her self-consciousness and modest behavior also contribute to his positive impression of her. When she catches Gabriel looking at her, she becomes conscious of her appearance and brushes her face, while Gabriel is the one who blushes. This interaction highlights her youthful vanity and dignity.&#10;2. The girl's true identity is revealed when she encounters Gabriel on his farm during a subsequent visit. She is riding an auburn pony and wearing the same red jacket as the previous night when she sought his help with her runaway horse. Additionally, when Gabriel mentions that he found a hat, she confirms that it is hers and reveals that it flew away in the wind the previous night at one o'clock, which matches the timing of their earlier encounter. These details confirm her identity as the young woman from the previous night." />
    <node id="Gabriel Oak found the girl in her hut when she was missing because he heard his dog, Daisy, howling and scratching at the door of the hut. When he went to investigate, he saw that the girl's dog had led him to her. The girl had come to the milking and discovered Oak unconscious near the hut after hearing Daisy's distress. She poured milk over him, which revived him. Oak then asked her how she found him, and she explained that she heard Daisy's howling and scratching at the door of the hut when she came to the milking, leading her to discover Oak inside." />
    <node id="The &quot;girl&quot; racing after Farmer Oak is Bathsheba Everdene. She is doing so because she has realized that her aunt had mistakenly given the impression to Oak that she (Bathsheba) had a sweetheart, which is not true. Bathsheba wants to correct this misunderstanding as she has never had a sweetheart and never had several. Additionally, she had avoided giving him her hand during their earlier encounter because she was taken aback by his sudden declaration of love and proposal and didn't want to encourage him further. Therefore, she is chasing after Oak to clarify the misunderstanding and set things right between them." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, when Gabriel Oak observes the young woman through a mirror while she is visiting his farm, he notices that she seems to be avoiding his presence and looks around to ensure that all humanity is out of view before assuming an unusual position on her pony's back. Given these observations, it can be inferred that Oak realizes that the young woman is trying to avoid being seen by him or anyone else.&#10;&#10;As for what she might have been thinking or planning, the narrative provides some clues but does not offer definitive evidence. It is possible that she had come back to look for her hat, which she had lost in the wind the previous night, as Oak eventually finds and takes it with him. However, this is only a possibility, and the text does not confirm it.&#10;&#10;Overall, based on Oak's observations, it can be inferred that the young woman is trying to avoid being seen by others while visiting his farm, but her specific thoughts and intentions are left up to interpretation." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Gabriel Oak forms an impression of the young woman (Bathsheba Everdene) as someone who is trying to avoid being seen by others while visiting his farm. However, there is no detailed description provided about her height, features, or overall demeanor that would allow for a specific assessment of her appearance.&#10;&#10;When Oak first observes Bathsheba through the mirror, he notices that she seems to be avoiding his presence and assumes an unusual position on her pony's back. These observations suggest that Bathsheba is feeling self-conscious or uncomfortable around Oak, but they do not provide any physical description of her appearance.&#10;&#10;Later in the narrative, after Bathsheba discovers Oak unconscious near her hut and revives him by pouring milk over him, Oak asks her how she found him. She explains that she heard Daisy's howling and scratching at the door of the hut when she came to the milking, leading her to discover Oak inside. This interaction highlights Bathsheba's kindness and attentiveness but does not offer any further physical description of her appearance.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Oak forms an impression of Bathsheba as someone who is trying to avoid being seen by others, there is no specific assessment of her appearance provided in the narrative. It is also unclear how this comparison affects his perception of her, as the text does not offer any insight into Oak's thoughts or feelings about Bathsheba beyond his observations of her behavior." />

Humans can only stand and listen to the antiphonies of the trees on the right and left.&#10;&#10;There is an ancient and decaying plantation of beeches on the northern side of the hill, which shelters the southern slope from the keenest blasts.

The thin&#10;grasses, more or less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in&#10;breezes of differing powers, and almost of differing natures--one&#10;rubbing the blades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another&#10;brushing them like a soft broom.

It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil--an ordinary&#10;specimen of those smoothly-outlined protuberances of the globe which&#10;may remain undisturbed on some great day of confusion, when far&#10;grander heights and dizzy granite precipices topple down.&#10;&#10;The hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying&#10;plantation of beeches, whose upper verge formed a line over the&#10;crest, fringing its arched curve against the sky, like a mane.&#10;To-night these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest&#10;blasts, which smote the wood and floundered through it with a sound&#10;as of grumbling, or gushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened&#10;moan.

There was also a cat in a willow basket, from&#10;the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and&#10;affectionately surveyed the small birds around.&#10;&#10;The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the&#10;only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up&#10;and down the perches of its prison.

Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert&#10;wakefulness with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse&#10;operation, he looked at his watch, found that the hour-hand had&#10;shifted again, put on his hat, took the lamb in his arms, and carried&#10;it into the darkness.  After placing the little creature with its&#10;mother, he stood and carefully examined the sky, to ascertain the&#10;time of night from the altitudes of the stars.&#10;&#10;The Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless Pleiades, were&#10;half-way up the Southern sky, and between them hung Orion, which&#10;gorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now, as it&#10;soared forth above the rim of the landscape.

For a moment he seemed&#10;impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or rather with&#10;the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and&#10;sounds of man.  Human shapes, interferences, troubles, and joys&#10;were all as if they were not, and there seemed to be on the shaded&#10;hemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself; he could&#10;fancy them all gone round to the sunny side.&#10;&#10;Occupied thus, with eyes stretched afar, Oak gradually perceived&#10;that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the&#10;outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing." />

She discovered him and poured milk over him, which revived him.&#10;2. The girl seems reluctant to reveal her name to Gabriel because she is modest or uninterested in forming a relationship with him. Additionally, her lack of gratitude for the twopence he gives the gatekeeper highlights her self-centeredness and vanity. However, her actions in saving Gabriel's life demonstrate her courage and kindness, making her an important character in the narrative.&#10;3. The text does not provide definitive evidence, but it is possible that she had come back to look for her hat, which she had lost in the wind the previous night, as Oak eventually finds and takes it with him." />
    <node id="The &quot;Somebody&quot; who would like to speak with Miss Everdene is Mr. Oak, Gabriel Oak. He initially refers to himself as such because of his refined modesty, which is a characteristic of the rural world and differs from the customs of townspeople who use cards and announcements.&#10;&#10;Gabriel brings a lamb to Miss Everdene with the hope that she might like to rear it, as he thought girls usually do.

This is revealed when Oak &quot;instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind&quot; upon seeing her.&#10;2. The narrative suggests that she might have returned to look for her hat, which she had lost in the wind the previous night. Oak finds and takes the hat with him, implying that it was hers. However, this is not definitively stated in the text. Her motivations for visiting the plantation are not explicitly mentioned and remain open to interpretation.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there are clues that suggest she might have returned to look for her lost hat, the narrative does not provide definitive evidence for this theory. It is possible that she had another reason for visiting the plantation, which is left up to the reader's interpretation based on Oak's observations of her behavior." />
    <node id="The milkmaid, who is the same young woman Gabriel Oak had helped with her runaway horse the previous night, reddens when she realizes that Oak has recognized her. She becomes self-conscious as she remembers the &quot;strange antics&quot; she had exhibited while passing through the trees, which were observed by Oak. This realization causes a &quot;nettled palpitation&quot; and a hot face, leading her to blush deeply. In response, Oak looks away in considerateness, realizing that his gaze is making her uncomfortable." />

Recollection of the&#10;strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was&#10;succeeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation, and that by a hot&#10;face.  It was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to&#10;reddening as a rule; not a point in the milkmaid but was of the&#10;deepest rose-colour.  From the Maiden's Blush, through all varieties&#10;of the Provence down to the Crimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak's&#10;acquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he, in considerateness,&#10;turned away his head.&#10;&#10;The sympathetic man still looked the other way," />

I'm lately come to this place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A large farm?&quot; she inquired, casting her eyes round, and swinging&#10;back her hair, which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass; but&#10;it being now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent&#10;curves with a colour of their own.&#10;&#10;&quot;No; not large.

    <node id="1. The text does not provide any direct information about the young woman's plan to get oatmeal. It is possible that she needed to purchase some or had come to discuss it with Oak, but this is only speculation.&#10;2. While Oak is observing the young woman from a higher position, he cannot see her facial features clearly enough to be curious about them. His focus is more on her behavior and actions, which suggest that she is trying to avoid being seen. Therefore, there is no indication in the text of Oak being curious about the young woman's features due to his aerial position." />
    <node id="The source of the vivid and abiding impression of riding along the world's eastward roll while standing alone on a hill during midnight is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it suggests that it may be due to several factors. These include the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly objects, the better outlook upon space that a hill affords, the wind, and the solitude. The poetry of motion is described as an epic form of gratification that can be enjoyed by standing on a hill at a small hour of the night, expanding one's senses, and watching the stately progress through the stars.&#10;&#10;Experiencing such majestic speeding makes it hard to return to earth and believe it comes from a human frame because it creates a strong contrast between the vastness and grandeur of the universe and the smallness and insignificance of human beings. The narrator describes feeling disoriented and detached from humanity after such an experience, as if the consciousness of speeding is too immense to be contained within a tiny human frame." />

The poetry of motion is a&#10;phrase much in use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification&#10;it is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night,&#10;and, having first expanded with a sense of difference from the mass&#10;of civilised mankind, who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all&#10;such proceedings at this time, long and quietly watch your stately&#10;progress through the stars.

They had a clearness which was to be found&#10;nowhere in the wind, and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in&#10;nature.  They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.&#10;&#10;The tune was not floating unhindered into the open air: it seemed&#10;muffled in some way, and was altogether too curtailed in power to&#10;spread high or wide.  It came from the direction of a small dark&#10;object under the plantation hedge--a shepherd's hut--now presenting&#10;an outline to which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled&#10;to attach either meaning or use.&#10;&#10;The image as a whole was that of a small Noah's Ark on a small&#10;Ararat, allowing the traditionary outlines and general form of&#10;the Ark which are followed by toy-makers--and by these means are&#10;established in men's imaginations among their firmest, because&#10;earliest impressions--to pass as an approximate pattern.

A difference of colour in the&#10;stars--oftener read of than seen in England--was really perceptible&#10;here.

    <node id="Oak becomes awkward and hesitant in his interaction with Bathsheba's hand because he realizes that holding her hand for too long and commenting on its softness may have given her the wrong impression and made her feel uncomfortable.

This creates a rift in their relationship, causing her to avoid him until she feels more comfortable.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba offers to let Oak kiss her hand as a teasing response to his awkwardness and hesitation. She does this to lighten the mood and ease the tension between them. By doing so, she also wants to show Oak that she is not offended by his actions and that she can still joke around with him. This gesture allows them to move past the awkward moment and continue their relationship on a more comfortable note." />
    <node id="1. The conversation between Gabriel Oak and the unnamed young woman is significant because it sets the stage for their future interactions and serves to introduce their contrasting personalities and demeanors. Oak is straightforward, reliable, and community-oriented, while the girl comes across as modest, self-centered, and somewhat secretive.&#10;2. This initial interaction also establishes a sense of curiosity and mystery around the young woman's character, which piques the reader's interest and encourages them to learn more about her motivations and background. The fact that she remains unnamed throughout this exchange further emphasizes her enigmatic nature and adds to the intrigue surrounding her role in the narrative.&#10;3. Furthermore, their conversation highlights the power dynamics between these two characters, with Oak occupying a higher position both literally (as he observes her from a distance) and figuratively (as an experienced farmer), while the girl appears vulnerable and dependent on his assistance. This sets up a dynamic of mutual reliance and interdependence that will become more pronounced as the story progresses.&#10;4. Finally, this conversation also serves to underscore the theme of self-discovery and personal growth that pervades the narrative. Through their interactions, both Oak and the young woman learn more about themselves and their place in the world, ultimately forging a deep bond built on mutual respect, understanding, and admiration.&#10;&#10;In summary, the conversation between Gabriel Oak and the unnamed young woman is significant because it introduces their contrasting personalities, generates curiosity around her character, highlights power dynamics, and sets the stage for future interactions that will form an essential part of the narrative's exploration of self-discovery and personal growth." />

His features are exactly between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot as depicted in a window of his church, making him unremarkable or forgettable.&#10;2. The reaction of the red-jacketed maiden to Gabriel when he pays for her passage highlights her self-centeredness and vanity. Despite the fact that the twopence he gives the gatekeeper represents an appreciable amount that is an infringement on a day's wages, she fails to thank him or even acknowledge his help, indicating her lack of gratitude and selfishness.&#10;3. The contrast between Gabriel's generosity and kindness, as shown by his willingness to give up part of his wages to help the maiden, and her initial lack of gratitude sets up the conflict and dynamics of their relationship throughout the narrative." />

The poetry of motion is described as an epic form of gratification that can be enjoyed by standing on a hill at a small hour of the night, expanding one's senses, and watching the stately progress through the stars.&#10;&#10;Experiencing such majestic speeding makes it hard to return to earth and believe it comes from a human frame because it creates a strong contrast between the vastness and grandeur of the universe and the smallness and insignificance of human beings. The narrator describes feeling disoriented and detached from humanity after such an experience, as if the consciousness of speeding is too immense to be contained within a tiny human frame.">

The contrast between Gabriel's generosity and kindness, as shown by his willingness to give up part of his wages to help the maiden, and her initial lack of gratitude sets up the conflict and dynamics of their relationship throughout the narrative.">

As a result, the young woman avoids Gabriel Oak's presence during her subsequent visits to his farm. She is offended by his lack of tact in making her feel indecent, despite his good intentions.

He had leased the land, stocked it with two hundred sheep, and was now responsible for their welfare, particularly during lambing. The narrative highlights Oak's careful attention to his flock, describing his deliberate movements as he tends to them throughout the night, reflecting his expertise and deep understanding of his occupation as a shepherd.&#10;&#10;Inside the hut, Oak exhibits a quiet-energy while attending to various tasks such as checking on the ewes, assisting in the birthing process, and caring for newborn lambs. He carries a lantern to illuminate his way as he moves around the enclosure, and his steady swings and turns among the flock display elements of grace, demonstrating his comfort and skill in this environment. After completing his rounds, Oak retires to the hut, where he sleeps on a simple couch near a stove that keeps him warm during the cold winter nights.&#10;&#10;Farmer Oak's movements and actions throughout the narrative illustrate his deep connection to his work as a shepherd and his devotion to ensuring the success of his new farming venture." target="Based on the description provided, Farmer Oak is a young man of sound judgment and reliable character during working days.

This suggests that Oak may be somewhat indifferent or uninterested in religious matters, preferring to focus on more worldly concerns.&#10;&#10;Despite this apparent lack of spiritual engagement, Oak is described as having a &quot;quiet modesty&quot; that sets him apart from others.

This suggests that Oak may be somewhat indifferent or uninterested in religious matters, preferring to focus on more worldly concerns.&#10;&#10;Despite this apparent lack of spiritual engagement, Oak is described as having a &quot;quiet modesty&quot; that sets him apart from others.

He has easy movements, wears appropriate clothing, and demonstrates general good behavior. On Sundays, however, he adopts a more laid-back attitude, attending church but privately yawning during the sermon and thinking about dinner. This suggests that Oak may be somewhat indifferent or uninterested in religious matters, preferring to focus on more worldly concerns.&#10;&#10;Despite this apparent lack of spiritual engagement, Oak is described as having a &quot;quiet modesty&quot; that sets him apart from others. He carries himself with humility and does not seek attention or validation based on his appearance. Instead, he seems to value his capacity for hard work and ability to &quot;wear well&quot; over superficial appearances.&#10;&#10;At the time of the narrative, Oak is no longer a young man but has not yet reached middle age. He is at the peak of his masculine growth, with his intellect and emotions clearly separated, allowing him to make rational decisions and approach problems with a level head. This maturity and stability in his personality make him an effective and skilled shepherd, as evidenced by his careful attention to his flock during the lambing season.">

Gabriel's physical appearance is significant because it reflects his character, which is average or neutral in many ways. His features are exactly between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot as depicted in a window of his church, making him unremarkable or forgettable.&#10;2. The reaction of the red-jacketed maiden to Gabriel when he pays for her passage highlights her self-centeredness and vanity. Despite the fact that the twopence he gives the gatekeeper represents an appreciable amount that is an infringement on a day's wages, she fails to thank him or even acknowledge his help, indicating her lack of gratitude and selfishness.&#10;3. The contrast between Gabriel's generosity and kindness, as shown by his willingness to give up part of his wages to help the maiden, and her initial lack of gratitude sets up the conflict and dynamics of their relationship throughout the narrative.">

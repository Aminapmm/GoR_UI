He also gets his tan shoes polished to a brassy luster and shaves just before arriving at her flat.&#10;&#10;During their visit to various places in Washington, the woman notices that her companion is interested in learning about new things and asks questions about the sights they see. For instance, when they visit the Capitol, she tells him (and he asks her to guess) how many feet it is to the top of the dome, and at lunchtime, she shows herself as an habitue by leading him through the catacombs to the senate restaurant. He also shows a willingness to play along with her, despite being a serious person.&#10;&#10;The woman's companion is also seen as a friendly and sociable person, as he gets along well with the people they meet during their visit, such as the congressman, a cynical young widow, commanders and majors, newspapermen, chemists and geographers, and a teacher from the militant suffrage headquarters.&#10;&#10;Moreover, her companion is portrayed as a helpful person who offers practical solutions to problems. For example, he tells the secretary what to do when her eyes are tired from typing, and the teacher asks him (not as the husband of a friend but as a physician) whether there is &quot;anything to this inoculation for colds.&quot;&#10;&#10;Overall, the woman forms a positive impression of her companion based on their visit to Washington D.C., seeing him as a thoughtful, considerate, friendly, and helpful person who goes out of his way to please her." />

She was glad that he had made&#10;the decision himself.&#10;&#10;She had leave from the office for two days.&#10;&#10;She watched him marching from the train, solid, assured, carrying his&#10;heavy suit-case, and she was diffident--he was such a bulky person to&#10;handle.

The teacher took her to headquarters. Carol never&#10;became a prominent suffragist. Indeed her only recognized position was&#10;as an able addresser of envelopes. But she was casually adopted by&#10;this family of friendly women who, when they were not being mobbed or&#10;arrested, took dancing lessons or went picnicking up the Chesapeake&#10;Canal or talked about the politics of the American Federation of Labor.&#10;&#10;With the congressman's secretary and the teacher Carol leased a small&#10;flat. Here she found home, her own place and her own people. She had,&#10;though it absorbed most of her salary, an excellent nurse for Hugh. She&#10;herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays.

    <node id="The author, Sinclair Lewis, critiques the Tories' opposition to the organizer by pointing out the hypocrisy and self-interest in their actions. He suggests that they are not truly concerned about sedition or national security, but rather about protecting their own financial interests related to mortgages, wheat, and shops. The author also criticizes the Tories for labeling their opponents with derogatory terms as a means of justifying their opposition and delegitimizing the opposition's arguments. Lewis portrays this tactic as an &quot;eternal art&quot; used by various groups throughout history to maintain power and status, and he suggests that it is a disingenuous way of avoiding honest debate and dialogue.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the author critiques the Tories' narrow-minded perspective on what constitutes success or failure. He portrays the Uplifters, including Carol, as having more complex and nuanced ambitions than simply achieving wealth or fame. The author suggests that the Tories' focus on material success is misguided, and that their efforts to suppress opposition are ultimately self-defeating.&#10;&#10;Overall, Lewis critiques the Tories for prioritizing their own financial interests over the needs of the community, and for using underhanded tactics to silence opposition. He suggests that this approach is not only unethical, but also unsustainable in the long term." />

    <node id="The scenario presented is similar to the situation between Carol and Kennicott in the narrative. In response to the question, whether one would consider running away with their spouse, it depends on the context and intentions behind such an action. In the narrative, Carol initially agrees to accompany Kennicott on a two-week trip to the South, pretending to be his sister, as a way for them to reconnect and reignite their relationship.&#10;&#10;However, after some reflection, Carol appreciates the significance of this journey and the freedom it represents for her. She realizes that she can make her own decisions about her life and pursue experiences beyond her current environment. This trip is not just about rekindling the relationship, but also about Carol's personal growth and self-discovery.&#10;&#10;Therefore, if considering a similar scenario, one must be open to understanding the potential impact of this decision on both their relationship and their own personal development. Running away with one's spouse can signify an opportunity for reconnection, adventure, and exploration but should also encourage introspection and self-reflection." />

She feels a desire to love and connect with the town and its people, such as Kennicott and Sam Clark.&#10;&#10;Carol has also gained a new perspective through her interactions with army and navy men, bureau experts, and organizers who live comfortably on much less income than Kennicott and other wealthy Gopher Prairie residents. She realizes that these men are content and fulfilled despite their more modest means. Furthermore, she discovers that her previous dissatisfaction with Gopher Prairie was not unfounded, as she encounters others who share her views on the town's shortcomings.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol now feels a sense of compassion, understanding, and even pride in Gopher Prairie and its people, recognizing their efforts to improve themselves and their community." />

The price of lots had increased&#10;a third. But Carol could discover no more pictures nor interesting food&#10;nor gracious voices nor amusing conversation nor questing minds. She&#10;could, she asserted, endure a shabby but modest town; the town shabby&#10;and egomaniac she could not endure. She could nurse Champ Perry,&#10;and warm to the neighborliness of Sam Clark, but she could not sit&#10;applauding Honest Jim Blausser. Kennicott had begged her, in courtship&#10;days, to convert the town to beauty. If it was now as beautiful as Mr.&#10;Blausser and the Dauntless said, then her work" />

They bought land at a hundred and fifty, sold it next day at&#10;a hundred and seventy, and bought again. In three months Kennicott made&#10;seven thousand dollars, which was rather more than four times as much as&#10;society paid him for healing the sick.&#10;&#10;In early summer began a &quot;campaign of boosting.&quot; The Commercial Club&#10;decided that Gopher Prairie was not only a wheat-center but also the&#10;perfect site for factories, summer cottages, and state institutions. In&#10;charge of the campaign was Mr. James Blausser, who had recently come to&#10;town to speculate in land. Mr. Blausser was known as a Hustler. He liked&#10;to be called Honest Jim. He was a bulky, gauche, noisy, humorous man,&#10;with narrow eyes, a rustic complexion, large red hands, and brilliant&#10;clothes. He was attentive to all women.

She remembered that Kennicott and Sam&#10;Clark had listened to her songs, and she wanted to run to them and sing.&#10;&#10;&quot;At last,&quot; she rejoiced, &quot;I've come to a fairer attitude toward the&#10;town.

Her countless friends who&#10;appreciate her splendid labors with the local Red Cross realize how&#10;valuable she will be to any war board with which she chooses to become&#10;connected. Gopher Prairie thus adds another shining star to its service&#10;flag and without wishing to knock any neighboring communities, we would&#10;like to know any town of anywheres near our size in the state that has&#10;such a sterling war record.

Farmers&#10;coming in with sled-loads of wheat complained that Champ could not read&#10;the scale, that he seemed always to be watching some one back in the&#10;darkness of the bins. He was seen slipping through alleys, talking to&#10;himself, trying to avoid observation, creeping at last to the cemetery.&#10;Once Carol followed him and found the coarse, tobacco-stained,&#10;unimaginative old man lying on the snow of the grave, his thick arms&#10;spread out across the raw mound as if to protect her from the cold, her&#10;whom he had carefully covered up every night for sixty years, who was&#10;alone there now, uncared for.&#10;&#10;The elevator company, Ezra Stowbody president, let him go.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the unintended consequences of being an 'Uplifter' or a meddler in society's affairs include:&#10;&#10;1. Increased scrutiny and criticism: Uplifters often face criticism and skepticism from those who are comfortable with the status quo. They may be labeled as troublemakers, seditionists, or enemies of the state, which can harm their reputation and make it difficult for them to achieve their goals.&#10;2. Hypocrisy and self-interest: Those who oppose the Uplifters may do so not out of concern for national security or the common good, but rather to protect their own financial interests. This hypocrisy can undermine the credibility of the Uplifters and make it difficult for them to build support for their cause.&#10;3. Narrow definition of success: The opponents of the Uplifters often prioritize material success over other values, such as social justice or community well-being. This narrow definition of success can lead to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability and can undermine the efforts of the Uplifters to create meaningful change.&#10;4. Disillusionment: Uplifters may discover that the institutions they seek to reform are deeply entrenched and resistant to change. They may also find that their own colleagues and supporters are more interested in maintaining their power and status than in advancing the cause of reform. This disillusionment can lead to burnout, cynicism, or a loss of faith in the possibility of meaningful change.&#10;&#10;Overall, being an Uplifter or meddler in society's affairs can have significant unintended consequences, including increased scrutiny and criticism, hypocrisy and self-interest among opponents, a narrow definition of success, and disillusionment. However, the author also suggests that the only defense against these challenges is unembittered laughter and a commitment to challenging the tyranny of institutions that claim to serve the common good but instead perpetuate inequality and injustice." />

It was an&#10;endurance of monotonous details, yet she asserted that she had found&#10;&quot;real work.&quot;&#10;&#10;Disillusions she did have. She discovered that in the afternoon, office&#10;routine stretches to the grave. She discovered that an office is as full&#10;of cliques and scandals as a Gopher Prairie.

He liked to be called &quot;Honest Jim&quot; and was responsible for the aggressive marketing of Gopher Prairie's advantages and potential through various means, such as reorganizing the band, hiring a semi-professional pitcher for the local baseball team, and installing a White Way on Main Street." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Now the point of this is: I'm not only insisting that Gopher Prairie&#10;is going to be Minnesota's pride, the brightest ray in the glory of the&#10;North Star State, but also and furthermore that it is right now, and&#10;still more shall be, as good a place to live in, and love in, and bring&#10;up the Little Ones in, and it's got as much refinement and culture, as&#10;any burg on the whole bloomin' expanse of God's Green Footstool, and&#10;that goes, get me, that goes!&quot;&#10;&#10;Half an hour later Chairman Haydock moved a vote of thanks to Mr.&#10;Blausser.&#10;&#10;The boosters' campaign was on.&#10;&#10;The town sought that efficient and modern variety of fame which is known&#10;as &quot;publicity.&quot; The band was reorganized, and provided by the Commercial&#10;Club with uniforms of purple and gold.

She realized that office routine stretched into the afternoon, just like on Main Street, and that offices were filled with cliques, scandals, and unhealthy living habits, much like Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;However, she also discovered that business women could have frank friendships and enmities and enjoy a blissful free Sunday, which she had never experienced as a housewife. These discoveries made her realize that the world of offices was not as glamorous or different from Gopher Prairie as she had initially thought.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol did not become a prominent suffragist, but she was casually adopted by a family of friendly women who took her to militant suffrage headquarters.

    <node id="Carol's experience in Washington was initially disappointing as her job at the Bureau of War Risk Insurance involved routine work similar to what she did in Gopher Prairie. However, she discovered the value of frank friendships and the joy of having a blissful free Sunday, which she never experienced as a housewife. She also realized that institutions, not individuals, were the enemies and began to question why she raged at people.&#10;&#10;Carol did not become a prominent suffragist, but she was casually adopted by a family of friendly women who took her to militant suffrage headquarters. This allowed her to experience a sense of community and belonging that she had never felt before. She also gained an impersonal attitude and saw things more objectively.&#10;&#10;Carol's work and association with these women made her realize that she had been too touchily personal, like Maud Dyer. She began to ask questions about the attitudes of people around her and contemplated issues such as the nationalization of railroads, labor unions, and social injustices.&#10;&#10;Through her experiences, Carol found a sense of home in Washington. She realized that she was not alone in feeling dissatisfied with life and seeking something more significant. She discovered that there were thousands of women who shared her feelings and that they could be useful in building up real political power for women.&#10;&#10;Carol's time in Washington allowed her to gain a new perspective on life, work, and the people around her. Although she was unsure whether she should return to Gopher Prairie, she felt significant as an ordinary life of the age made articulate and protesting.

Even her flight had been but the temporary courage of&#10;panic. The thing she gained in Washington was not information about&#10;office-systems and labor unions but renewed courage, that amiable&#10;contempt called poise. Her glimpse of tasks involving millions of people&#10;and a score of nations reduced Main Street from bloated importance to&#10;its actual pettiness. She could never again be quite so awed by the&#10;power with which she herself had endowed the Vidas and Blaussers and&#10;Bogarts.&#10;&#10;From her work and from her association with women who had organized&#10;suffrage associations in hostile cities, or had defended political&#10;prisoners, she caught something of an impersonal attitude; saw that she&#10;had been as touchily personal as Maud Dyer.&#10;&#10;And why, she began to ask, did she rage at individuals?

Shall I&#10;be frank? Remember when I say 'you' I don't mean you alone. I'm thinking&#10;of thousands of women who come to Washington and New York and&#10;Chicago every year, dissatisfied at home and seeking a sign in the&#10;heavens--women of all sorts, from timid mothers of fifty in cotton&#10;gloves, to girls just out of Vassar who organize strikes in their own&#10;fathers' factories! All of you are more or less useful to me, but only&#10;a few of you can take my place, because I have one virtue (only one): I&#10;have given up father and mother and children for the love of God.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here's the test for you: Do you come to 'conquer the East,' as people&#10;say, or do you come to conquer yourself?&#10;&#10;&quot;" />

It had not occurred to her that&#10;there was also a story of Will Kennicott, into which she entered only so&#10;much as he entered into hers; that he had bewilderments and concealments&#10;as intricate as her own, and soft treacherous desires for sympathy.&#10;&#10;Thus she brooded, looking at the amazing sea, holding his hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;VIII&#10;&#10;&#10;She was in Washington; Kennicott was in Gopher Prairie, writing as dryly&#10;as ever about water-pipes and goose-hunting and Mrs. Fageros's mastoid.&#10;&#10;She was talking at dinner to a generalissima of suffrage. Should she&#10;return?&#10;&#10;The leader spoke wearily:&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear, I'm perfectly selfish. I can't quite visualize the needs of&#10;your husband, and it seems to me that your baby will do quite as well in&#10;the schools here as in your barracks at home.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you think I'd better not go back?&quot; Carol sounded disappointed.&#10;" />

By introducing Carol to commanders, majors, newspapermen, chemists, geographers, fiscal experts from the bureaus, and a teacher familiar with militant suffrage headquarters, she helped expose Carol to a diverse range of people and ideas outside of Gopher Prairie's narrow social sphere. This exposure ultimately played a significant role in broadening Carol's perspective and shaping her newfound appreciation for Gopher Prairie and its people." />

The&#10;cautious dullness of a Gopher Prairie appeared in boarding-houses where&#10;ladylike bureau-clerks gossiped to polite young army officers about&#10;the movies; a thousand Sam Clarks and a few Widow Bogarts were to be&#10;identified in the Sunday motor procession, in theater parties, and&#10;at the dinners of State Societies, to which the emigres from Texas or&#10;Michigan surged that they might confirm themselves in the faith that&#10;their several Gopher Prairies were notoriously &quot;a whole lot peppier and&#10;chummier than this stuck-up East.&quot;&#10;&#10;But she found a Washington which did not cleave to Main Street.&#10;&#10;Guy Pollock wrote to a cousin, a temporary army captain, a confiding and&#10;buoyant lad who took Carol to tea-dances, and laughed, as she had always&#10;wanted some one to laugh, about nothing in particular.

Her days were swift, and she knew that in her folly of running&#10;away she had found the courage to be wise.&#10;&#10;She had a dispiriting first month of hunting lodgings in the crowded&#10;city.

The woman was mystery, romance, a&#10;story which told itself differently every day; now she was a murderess,&#10;now the neglected wife of an ambassador. It was mystery which Carol had&#10;most lacked in Gopher Prairie, where every house was open to view, where&#10;every person was but too easy to meet, where there were no secret gates&#10;opening upon moors over which one might walk by moss-deadened paths to&#10;strange high adventures in an ancient garden.&#10;&#10;As she flitted up Sixteenth Street after a Kreisler recital, given late&#10;in the afternoon for the government clerks, as the lamps kindled in&#10;spheres of soft fire, as the breeze flowed into the street, fresh&#10;as prairie winds and kindlier, as she glanced up the elm alley of&#10;Massachusetts Avenue, as she was rested by the integrity of the Scottish&#10;Rite Temple, she loved the city as she loved no one save Hugh.

This woman was the secretary of a congressman who had many acquaintances in the navy.

    <node id="Carrie (Carol) Kennicott, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis's Main Street, has decided to leave Gopher Prairie to escape the narrow-mindedness and stifling atmosphere of the town. She is driven by a desire for intellectual stimulation, cultural growth, and self-discovery. Carrie feels that she has been ruled by fear of being judged by others and wants to break free from these constraints. By leaving, she hopes to gain a broader perspective on life, define her own terms of personal success, and find her purpose or &quot;work&quot; in the world. She also wishes to acquire tolerance and empathy for people who are different from herself, as well as develop her individuality and independence.

    <node id="The war price of wheat led to a boom in Gopher Prairie as farmers sold their land at high prices and moved into the town. The townsmen, including millers, real-estate men, lawyers, merchants, and Dr. Will Kennicott, benefited from this boom as they bought land at lower prices, sold it at higher prices, and made significant profits. For instance, Dr. Kennicott made seven thousand dollars in three months, which was more than four times what he earned as a doctor during the same period.

Sam Clark, Kennicott, and Dave Dyer all shared this view, proudly stating their agreement with Sam's plan to kick the organizer out of town.&#10;&#10;Carol, on the other hand, reacted differently to Kennicott's opinions during their conversation on the porch. When Kennicott hinted that she thought Sam was too hard on the organizer, Carol responded by asking if Sam wasn't being needlessly heroic in his actions. This response showed that Carol did not agree with Kennicott's views on how the organizer should have been treated and instead questioned the need for such harsh measures against him.&#10;&#10;Throughout the narrative, it is evident that Carol has developed a more compassionate perspective towards Gopher Prairie and its people, which is different from Kennicott's more hardline stance on certain issues. Her response to his opinions on the organizer further highlights this difference in perspectives and illustrates her ability to question and challenge the views of those around her." />

    <node id="Carol finds it difficult to support Kennicott's enthusiasm for Mr. Blausser and the Dauntless's efforts to improve and beautify Gopher Prairie because her perspective towards the town has shifted. She no longer sees it as a dull and tedious place but as a struggling new settlement with hardworking citizens trying their best to raise their families. She empathizes with the shabbiness and isolation of Main Street and appreciates the efforts of the townspeople to assert culture and greatness, even if they are pretentious at times.&#10;&#10;However, her experiences in Washington and interactions with a diverse range of people have exposed her to different ways of living and thinking. She has encountered others who share her views on the town's shortcomings, and she has realized that it is possible to be content and fulfilled with less income and material wealth than the wealthy residents of Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while she appreciates the efforts to improve the town, she also recognizes that there are more important things in life than material development and progress. She may feel that Kennicott's enthusiasm for Mr. Blausser and the Dauntless's efforts is misguided or overemphasized, leading to her difficulty in fully supporting it.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Carol has developed a more compassionate perspective towards Gopher Prairie and its people, which may make her less inclined to support aggressive campaigns for change that could potentially harm the community's sense of unity and identity. She may also feel that such efforts are driven by ego and a desire for recognition rather than genuine concern for the town's well-being.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's newfound appreciation for Gopher Prairie and its people, as well as her exposure to different perspectives and ways of living, have led her to question and challenge Kennicott's enthusiasm for Mr. Blausser and the Dauntless's efforts to improve the town." />

    <node id="1. Mystery and Romance: Carol appreciates the mystery and romance that she encounters in the city, which is exemplified by a particular dark square house with a hint of magnolias and a courtyard. She enjoys the sense of intrigue and imagination that comes from not being able to fully know the woman who is always peering out from the second-story window, as it provides a stark contrast to the openness and familiarity of Gopher Prairie.&#10;2. Diversity: Carol also appreciates the diversity of people and experiences that she encounters in the city. She enjoys meeting new and interesting individuals, such as commanders, majors, newspapermen, chemists, geographers, fiscal experts from the bureaus, and a teacher familiar with militant suffrage headquarters, through her interactions with the cynical young widow. This exposure to a wide range of perspectives and ideas is something that she lacked in Gopher Prairie's narrow social sphere.&#10;3. Culture: Carol values the city's cultural offerings, such as the Kreisler recital that she attends late in the afternoon for the government clerks. She appreciates the beauty of the music and the sense of community that it fosters among the attendees. Additionally, she enjoys the architectural integrity of the Scottish Rite Temple, which stands out as a symbol of stability and tradition amidst the bustling cityscape.&#10;4. Natural Beauty: Carol also finds solace in the natural beauty that the city has to offer, such as the elm alley of Massachusetts Avenue and the fresh prairie winds that flow into the streets. These elements provide her with a sense of rest and relaxation, and they serve as a reminder of the simple pleasures of nature that she often missed while living in Gopher Prairie.&#10;5. Secrecy and Anonymity: Finally, Carol appreciates the sense of secrecy and anonymity that the city provides, which allows her to escape the prying eyes and gossip of small-town life. She enjoys being able to walk down the street without being recognized or judged by her neighbors, as it gives her a sense of freedom and independence that she never experienced in Gopher Prairie." />
    <node id="The speaker, Mr. Blausser, is extremely optimistic about the potential growth and development of Gopher Prairie. He sees it as a place with great refinement and culture, and believes that it can become Minnesota's pride and a leading location in the North Star State. He is leading the &quot;Watch Gopher Prairie Grow&quot; campaign initiated by the Commercial Club, which aims to promote the town as an ideal location for factories, summer cottages, and state institutions.&#10;&#10;Those who do not share his optimism, such as Carol Kennicott, are implied to be misguided or lacking in vision. The speaker, and those like him, believe that anyone who is not patriotic and supportive of the war effort and the growth of their community should be made to be so. They expect conformity and agreement with their pro-war and pro-growth agenda." />
    <node id="1. Unfamiliarity with the City: One of the primary factors contributing to the uncertainty of Carol's experiences is her initial unfamiliarity with urban life. Having grown up in a small town like Gopher Prairie, Carol finds herself overwhelmed by the size and complexity of Washington, D.C., which leads to feelings of confusion and disorientation.&#10;2. Cynical Company: Another factor is the company that Carol keeps during her time in Washington. The cynical young widow who serves as her guide introduces her to a diverse range of people, but many of them are jaded or overly critical of society. This exposure to negative perspectives can be draining and disheartening for Carol, making it difficult for her to find her footing in this new environment.&#10;3. Personal Insecurity: On a personal level, Carol struggles with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt throughout her journey. She often compares herself to the accomplished individuals she meets through the cynical young widow, causing her to question her own worth and abilities. These insecurities contribute to the wavering lines on the chart as they create uncertainty in Carol's progression towards personal growth.&#10;4. Ideological Conflict: The text also highlights the ideological conflict that Carol faces when confronted with new ideas and perspectives. While she is eager to learn and expand her horizons, she sometimes struggles to reconcile these new concepts with her own deeply-held beliefs. This internal struggle is represented by the broken lines on the chart, as Carol's progression towards understanding and acceptance is not always smooth or straightforward.&#10;5. Desire for Autonomy: Finally, the text illustrates Carol's growing desire for autonomy and independence. She wants to make her own decisions and pursue her own interests, but she often feels constrained by societal expectations and gender norms. This tension between her desire for self-determination and the external pressures she faces is depicted in the chart as a struggle between rising lines (representing progress) and sinkings ones (representing setbacks).&#10;&#10;Overall, the text presents Carol's experiences as complex and uncertain due to various factors, including unfamiliarity with city life, cynical company, personal insecurity, ideological conflict, and a desire for autonomy. These elements create a wavering and sometimes broken progression for Carol, reflecting the challenges she faces on her journey towards self-discovery and growth." />

He becomes more open to incorporating elements that his wife values and appreciates, even if they may be less practical.

The transformative experience for the woman came from working in the Bureau of War Risk Insurance in Washington, D.C., which turned out to be quite different from what she had expected. Initially, she thought her job would involve significant and inspiring work, but instead, she found herself filing correspondence and dictating letters all day. However, this experience allowed her to perceive that office work was not incompatible with maintaining feminine virtue and that it could provide a sense of community and belonging she had never felt before.&#10;2. In the office environment, she discovered that business women could have frank friendships and enmities and enjoy a blissful free Sunday, which she had never experienced as a housewife in Gopher Prairie. This realization made her feel like she was no longer one-half of a marriage but the whole of a human being, as she could do office work without having to apologize for her thoughts or report everything she did or might do to her husband at the end of the day.&#10;3. Additionally, the woman's contact with people from all over the country made her realize that her world was not confined to Main Street and a kitchen but linked with Paris, Bangkok, Madrid, and other places around the world. She also discovered that cooking and cleaning, when divested of the fussing of an Aunt Bessie, take but a tenth of the time she had spent on them in Gopher Prairie.&#10;4. The woman's visit to Washington, D.C., allowed her to perceive office work as being compatible with maintaining feminine virtue and provided her with valuable experiences and relationships that shaped her perspective on work and life.

Here she found home, her own place and her own people. She had,&#10;though it absorbed most of her salary, an excellent nurse for Hugh. She&#10;herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays. There were&#10;walks with him, there were motionless evenings of reading, but chiefly&#10;Washington was associated with people, scores of them, sitting about the&#10;flat, talking, talking, talking, not always wisely but always excitedly." target="Carol Kennicott, the main character, met a cynical young widow in Washington through Guy Pollock's army captain cousin. This woman was the secretary of a congressman who had many acquaintances in the navy. She played a significant role in expanding Carol's social circle and introducing her to various notable figures in society, politics, and the military, including commanders, majors, newspapermen, chemists, geographers, fiscal experts from the bureaus, and a teacher familiar with militant suffrage headquarters. These interactions helped expose Carol to a diverse range of people and ideas outside of Gopher Prairie's narrow social sphere, shaping her newfound appreciation for Gopher Prairie and its people.">

Although she initially thought she would be inspired by the Great World and feel that her work was a part of vast affairs, she found that her job primarily involved filing correspondence all day and dictating answers to letters of inquiry. She realized that office routine stretched into the afternoon, just like on Main Street, and that offices were filled with cliques, scandals, and unhealthy living habits, much like Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;However, she also discovered that business women could have frank friendships and enmities and enjoy a blissful free Sunday, which she had never experienced as a housewife. These discoveries made her realize that the world of offices was not as glamorous or different from Gopher Prairie as she had initially thought.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol did not become a prominent suffragist, but she was casually adopted by a family of friendly women who took her to militant suffrage headquarters. This allowed her to experience a sense of community and belonging that she had never felt before. Overall, while her job in the Bureau of War Risk Insurance was not what she had expected, it provided her with valuable experiences and relationships that shaped her perspective on work and life.">

This narrow definition of success can lead to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability and can undermine the efforts of the Uplifters to create meaningful change.&#10;4. Disillusionment: Uplifters may discover that the institutions they seek to reform are deeply entrenched and resistant to change. They may also find that their own colleagues and supporters are more interested in maintaining their power and status than in advancing the cause of reform. This disillusionment can lead to burnout, cynicism, or a loss of faith in the possibility of meaningful change.&#10;&#10;Overall, being an Uplifter or meddler in society's affairs can have significant unintended consequences, including increased scrutiny and criticism, hypocrisy and self-interest among opponents, a narrow definition of success, and disillusionment. However, the author also suggests that the only defense against these challenges is unembittered laughter and a commitment to challenging the tyranny of institutions that claim to serve the common good but instead perpetuate inequality and injustice.">

Specifically, Sam becomes more receptive to the idea of including fanlights and white shutters against rosy brick in the design of their new house, which he had previously dismissed as impractical. This shift suggests that Sam is becoming more considerate of his wife's preferences and willing to compromise on practicality to create a more homely atmosphere in their new house. Overall, the experience with his wife in Washington D.C. helps Sam to appreciate the value of aesthetics and thoughtfulness in designing their shared living space.">

Increased scrutiny and criticism: Uplifters often face criticism and skepticism from those who are comfortable with the status quo. They may be labeled as troublemakers, seditionists, or enemies of the state, which can harm their reputation and make it difficult for them to achieve their goals.&#10;2. Hypocrisy and self-interest: Those who oppose the Uplifters may do so not out of concern for national security or the common good, but rather to protect their own financial interests. This hypocrisy can undermine the credibility of the Uplifters and make it difficult for them to build support for their cause.&#10;3. Narrow definition of success: The opponents of the Uplifters often prioritize material success over other values, such as social justice or community well-being. This narrow definition of success can lead to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability and can undermine the efforts of the Uplifters to create meaningful change.&#10;4. Disillusionment: Uplifters may discover that the institutions they seek to reform are deeply entrenched and resistant to change. They may also find that their own colleagues and supporters are more interested in maintaining their power and status than in advancing the cause of reform. This disillusionment can lead to burnout, cynicism, or a loss of faith in the possibility of meaningful change.&#10;&#10;Overall, being an Uplifter or meddler in society's affairs can have significant unintended consequences, including increased scrutiny and criticism, hypocrisy and self-interest among opponents, a narrow definition of success, and disillusionment. However, the author also suggests that the only defense against these challenges is unembittered laughter and a commitment to challenging the tyranny of institutions that claim to serve the common good but instead perpetuate inequality and injustice.">

Unfamiliarity with the City: One of the primary factors contributing to the uncertainty of Carol's experiences is her initial unfamiliarity with urban life. Having grown up in a small town like Gopher Prairie, Carol finds herself overwhelmed by the size and complexity of Washington, D.C., which leads to feelings of confusion and disorientation.&#10;2. Cynical Company: Another factor is the company that Carol keeps during her time in Washington. The cynical young widow who serves as her guide introduces her to a diverse range of people, but many of them are jaded or overly critical of society. This exposure to negative perspectives can be draining and disheartening for Carol, making it difficult for her to find her footing in this new environment.&#10;3. Personal Insecurity: On a personal level, Carol struggles with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt throughout her journey. She often compares herself to the accomplished individuals she meets through the cynical young widow, causing her to question her own worth and abilities. These insecurities contribute to the wavering lines on the chart as they create uncertainty in Carol's progression towards personal growth.&#10;4. Ideological Conflict: The text also highlights the ideological conflict that Carol faces when confronted with new ideas and perspectives. While she is eager to learn and expand her horizons, she sometimes struggles to reconcile these new concepts with her own deeply-held beliefs. This internal struggle is represented by the broken lines on the chart, as Carol's progression towards understanding and acceptance is not always smooth or straightforward.&#10;5. Desire for Autonomy: Finally, the text illustrates Carol's growing desire for autonomy and independence. She wants to make her own decisions and pursue her own interests, but she often feels constrained by societal expectations and gender norms. This tension between her desire for self-determination and the external pressures she faces is depicted in the chart as a struggle between rising lines (representing progress) and sinkings ones (representing setbacks).&#10;&#10;Overall, the text presents Carol's experiences as complex and uncertain due to various factors, including unfamiliarity with city life, cynical company, personal insecurity, ideological conflict, and a desire for autonomy. These elements create a wavering and sometimes broken progression for Carol, reflecting the challenges she faces on her journey towards self-discovery and growth.">

Unfamiliarity with the City: One of the primary factors contributing to the uncertainty of Carol's experiences is her initial unfamiliarity with urban life. Having grown up in a small town like Gopher Prairie, Carol finds herself overwhelmed by the size and complexity of Washington, D.C., which leads to feelings of confusion and disorientation.&#10;2. Cynical Company: Another factor is the company that Carol keeps during her time in Washington. The cynical young widow who serves as her guide introduces her to a diverse range of people, but many of them are jaded or overly critical of society. This exposure to negative perspectives can be draining and disheartening for Carol, making it difficult for her to find her footing in this new environment.&#10;3. Personal Insecurity: On a personal level, Carol struggles with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt throughout her journey. She often compares herself to the accomplished individuals she meets through the cynical young widow, causing her to question her own worth and abilities. These insecurities contribute to the wavering lines on the chart as they create uncertainty in Carol's progression towards personal growth.&#10;4. Ideological Conflict: The text also highlights the ideological conflict that Carol faces when confronted with new ideas and perspectives. While she is eager to learn and expand her horizons, she sometimes struggles to reconcile these new concepts with her own deeply-held beliefs. This internal struggle is represented by the broken lines on the chart, as Carol's progression towards understanding and acceptance is not always smooth or straightforward.&#10;5. Desire for Autonomy: Finally, the text illustrates Carol's growing desire for autonomy and independence. She wants to make her own decisions and pursue her own interests, but she often feels constrained by societal expectations and gender norms. This tension between her desire for self-determination and the external pressures she faces is depicted in the chart as a struggle between rising lines (representing progress) and sinkings ones (representing setbacks).&#10;&#10;Overall, the text presents Carol's experiences as complex and uncertain due to various factors, including unfamiliarity with city life, cynical company, personal insecurity, ideological conflict, and a desire for autonomy. These elements create a wavering and sometimes broken progression for Carol, reflecting the challenges she faces on her journey towards self-discovery and growth.">

Sam Clark, Kennicott, and Dave Dyer all shared this view, proudly stating their agreement with Sam's plan to kick the organizer out of town.&#10;&#10;Carol, on the other hand, reacted differently to Kennicott's opinions during their conversation on the porch. When Kennicott hinted that she thought Sam was too hard on the organizer, Carol responded by asking if Sam wasn't being needlessly heroic in his actions. This response showed that Carol did not agree with Kennicott's views on how the organizer should have been treated and instead questioned the need for such harsh measures against him.&#10;&#10;Throughout the narrative, it is evident that Carol has developed a more compassionate perspective towards Gopher Prairie and its people, which is different from Kennicott's more hardline stance on certain issues. Her response to his opinions on the organizer further highlights this difference in perspectives and illustrates her ability to question and challenge the views of those around her.">

She no longer sees it as a dull and tedious place but as a struggling new settlement with hardworking citizens trying their best to raise their families. She empathizes with the shabbiness and isolation of Main Street and appreciates the efforts of the townspeople to assert culture and greatness, even if they are pretentious at times.&#10;&#10;However, her experiences in Washington and interactions with a diverse range of people have exposed her to different ways of living and thinking. She has encountered others who share her views on the town's shortcomings, and she has realized that it is possible to be content and fulfilled with less income and material wealth than the wealthy residents of Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while she appreciates the efforts to improve the town, she also recognizes that there are more important things in life than material development and progress. She may feel that Kennicott's enthusiasm for Mr. Blausser and the Dauntless's efforts is misguided or overemphasized, leading to her difficulty in fully supporting it.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Carol has developed a more compassionate perspective towards Gopher Prairie and its people, which may make her less inclined to support aggressive campaigns for change that could potentially harm the community's sense of unity and identity. She may also feel that such efforts are driven by ego and a desire for recognition rather than genuine concern for the town's well-being.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's newfound appreciation for Gopher Prairie and its people, as well as her exposure to different perspectives and ways of living, have led her to question and challenge Kennicott's enthusiasm for Mr. Blausser and the Dauntless's efforts to improve the town.">

Mystery and Romance: Carol appreciates the mystery and romance that she encounters in the city, which is exemplified by a particular dark square house with a hint of magnolias and a courtyard. She enjoys the sense of intrigue and imagination that comes from not being able to fully know the woman who is always peering out from the second-story window, as it provides a stark contrast to the openness and familiarity of Gopher Prairie.&#10;2. Diversity: Carol also appreciates the diversity of people and experiences that she encounters in the city. She enjoys meeting new and interesting individuals, such as commanders, majors, newspapermen, chemists, geographers, fiscal experts from the bureaus, and a teacher familiar with militant suffrage headquarters, through her interactions with the cynical young widow. This exposure to a wide range of perspectives and ideas is something that she lacked in Gopher Prairie's narrow social sphere.&#10;3. Culture: Carol values the city's cultural offerings, such as the Kreisler recital that she attends late in the afternoon for the government clerks. She appreciates the beauty of the music and the sense of community that it fosters among the attendees. Additionally, she enjoys the architectural integrity of the Scottish Rite Temple, which stands out as a symbol of stability and tradition amidst the bustling cityscape.&#10;4. Natural Beauty: Carol also finds solace in the natural beauty that the city has to offer, such as the elm alley of Massachusetts Avenue and the fresh prairie winds that flow into the streets. These elements provide her with a sense of rest and relaxation, and they serve as a reminder of the simple pleasures of nature that she often missed while living in Gopher Prairie.&#10;5. Secrecy and Anonymity: Finally, Carol appreciates the sense of secrecy and anonymity that the city provides, which allows her to escape the prying eyes and gossip of small-town life. She enjoys being able to walk down the street without being recognized or judged by her neighbors, as it gives her a sense of freedom and independence that she never experienced in Gopher Prairie.">

She realized that office routine stretched into the afternoon, just like on Main Street, and that offices were filled with cliques, scandals, and unhealthy living habits, much like Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;However, she also discovered that business women could have frank friendships and enmities and enjoy a blissful free Sunday, which she had never experienced as a housewife. These discoveries made her realize that the world of offices was not as glamorous or different from Gopher Prairie as she had initially thought.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol did not become a prominent suffragist, but she was casually adopted by a family of friendly women who took her to militant suffrage headquarters. This allowed her to experience a sense of community and belonging that she had never felt before.

Carol demonstrated solemnity during Mrs. Champ Perry's funeral procession by participating in the event with other community members, including elderly individuals who were once frontier boys and girls.

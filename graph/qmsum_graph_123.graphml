    <node id="1. Phased return: The Welsh government officials mentioned that the return to school will be phased, with priority given to the most vulnerable children, such as those with additional learning needs.&#10;&#10;2. Communication and confidence: A key challenge is ensuring clear communication with parents, staff, and students to build confidence in returning to school. This will involve providing evidence and information on which decisions are based, so that parents and staff feel assured of their safety.&#10;&#10;3. Safety measures: Decisions about reopening schools will be made considering the safety and well-being of children, young people, and staff. Measures may include social distancing, enhanced cleaning procedures, and altered school layouts to minimize contact between individuals.&#10;&#10;4. Testing and tracing: Widespread testing, tracing, and quarantine capabilities will be crucial in the next phase of managing the pandemic, as they are essential for ensuring safety in all aspects of society, including schools.&#10;&#10;5. Workforce availability: Ensuring adequate numbers of staff is a significant challenge, as some may be unable to return due to health concerns or other commitments. Strategies for addressing this issue will need to be developed and implemented.&#10;&#10;6. Social distancing in school settings: Implementing social distancing measures in schools will be challenging, given the young age and close proximity of many students. Creative solutions, such as staggered schedules, may be necessary to address this issue.&#10;&#10;7. School transportation: Ensuring safe transportation for students will require careful planning and management, including reduced capacity on buses and other forms of transport to maintain social distancing.&#10;&#10;8. Gathering at school gates: Preventing gatherings at school gates will be important for minimizing the risk of infection. Strategies may include designated drop-off and pick-up areas, as well as staggered arrival and dismissal times.&#10;&#10;9. No immediate return to normal: The government officials stressed that a return to normal education is not imminent, and it is crucial to avoid giving false expectations about when schools will fully reopen." />

Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff, on the information that we have used to reach any decisions, to build confidence for parents and professionals, but also to give them time to plan. It will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working. And we also have to look at—and it's been paraphrased quite a lot today—if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting, which groups they should be. And, finally, how do we operationalise that? How do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be, and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available, to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education, school transport issues, how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate, for instance? So, there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of" />
    <node id=" be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education, and new approaches to what schooling may look like. But, again, I must be absolutely clear to you, members of the committee, and to people watching: it is not feasible, in this sense, that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, what is clear from what you've said is that it's going to be phased return. I would assume that would be the most vulnerable—perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first. Just reading some of the things that you've said today, can you answer that question? And can I also ask: you said that guiding principle No. 3 will be having the confidence of parents, staff and students, based on evidence and information, so they can plan ahead. What will that evidence and information be, and how will you know that you've got the confidence of parents to return?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said" />
    <node id=" imminent. I know that in some cases there has been speculation that a return to normal could be with us quite shortly. I'm clear that a return to normal is not imminent, and therefore I'm not in a position to give a date as to when we will see more schools opening up to more children.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Have you been given any indication at all by the chief medical officer as to when, in the longer term, it might be?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No, I have not been given a date. What I have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in, as you said, me making a decision. So, clearly, we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers, but the principles are very clear. Firstly, we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff. Obviously, I can't make a decision regarding education in isolation. It will have to be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic. Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that" />

And the final question from me on this: how important is testing going to be in this next phase, as you start to think about relaxing restrictions?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Obviously, the ability to be able to test, to trace and to quarantine will be critical to the next phase and will be a very, very important and significant building block in all aspects of the Government's work to respond to this pandemic.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you, Minister, and thank you, Siân. We've got some questions now on the impact on particular groups of children, from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Just following on from your answer to Siân Gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school, what's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment?

    <node id=", I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Item 2, then, this afternoon is an evidence session with the Welsh Government on the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, Steve Davies, director of the education directorate, and Huw Morris, who is group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Can I welcome you all and thank you for attending? Minister, I understand you'd like to make a short opening statement.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Lynne. And indeed, if I could just begin by, once again, putting on the record my gratitude to everyone who is helping us get through this pandemic. There are a vast number of people who are keeping our school hubs open, looking after vulnerable children, and the children of key workers. Because of them, and their efforts, those key workers are able to carry on their critical roles in responding to COVID-19. I am extremely proud of the way that members of the school community have gone above and beyond. They have kept their schools open out of hours" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. Well, we have come to the end of our time, and, as to anything that we didn't ask, we will have to write to the Minister. Can I just thank the Minister and her officials for your attendance today? We know how busy you are dealing with the pandemic and we very much welcome this opportunity to have this discussion with you. So, thank you, Minister and officials for your time. As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. I see that Members are content, so we will now proceed to meet in private." />
    <node id="1. Flexible Counseling Methods: The additional financial resources can be used to provide flexible counseling methods such as remote counseling via telephone and video support. This allows children and families to access counseling services while adhering to lockdown and social distancing rules.&#10;&#10;2. Remote Therapy Approaches: As restrictions are gradually removed, these funds can also be utilized to offer enhanced family therapy or therapy approaches in a manner that ensures safety and follows social distancing guidelines. The money does not necessarily have to be used for one-to-one counseling sessions and can be used to provide the best method of support for individual children and their families.&#10;&#10;3. Funding for Professional Development: A part of this additional funding will be allocated towards the professional learning and development of counsellors. This is crucial as counsellors may need to adapt their skills and abilities to work effectively within the confines of lockdown and social distancing rules, ensuring they can continue to provide much-needed support for children and young people dealing with fears and anxieties during this time.&#10;&#10;4. Increasing and Ramping up Services: The additional financial resources will help local authorities increase and ramp up services to support children and families in the immediacy of the lockdown situation, while also planning for a potential growth in demand for these services in the future. This proactive approach aims to put systems in place now rather than waiting for everything to return to normal." />
    <node id=" additional financial resources, and we've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, that would include things like telephone and video support as well, I guess, then.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely. So, that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we're doing now, but also, as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed, looking at an enhanced family therapy, or a therapy approach. So, when we talk about counselling, I think it's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis. That might not be appropriate for some children, especially our younger children and their families, and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy—in the widest possible terms—that is the best method to support individual children and their families. But, clearly, we're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment. Some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors, because, of course, they may be being asked" />
    <node id=" children and young people, to have fears and anxieties at this time. That's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in. But, of course, there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling, and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support. So, the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. In the immediacy, of course, that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we've traditionally delivered services in the past, because of social distancing and lockdown rules, but we want to get some of these systems in place now, rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal. We need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now, but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services. So, we've been in close touch with local authorities, asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources, and we've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So," />
    <node id=" Some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors, because, of course, they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Thank you, Minister.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Dawn, before you ask your final question, I've got a couple of supplementaries—firstly from Suzy, and then from Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Oh, thank you. My question goes back to the comment you made earlier, Minister, about the number of children doubling—sorry, vulnerable children doubling—after the Easter break, if we can call it that. So, what I'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments. So, was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the Easter break, and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Suzy, what I believe that we're seeing in our schools" />
    <node id=": Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Minister. It's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and I assume, within that, appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child. Similarly, with special educational needs, whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school, and they may not respond as well to remote working, or remote contact, with an SEN advisor, are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, first of all, Dawn, you're absolutely right: my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children, and schools should continue to refer children to children's services if they have any concerns, and that would also, of course, be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children. So, there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that, despite the circumstances they find themselves in, they should continue to report and" />
    <node id=" beginning of the crisis and the lockdown?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Suzy, what I believe that we're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school. So, there has been, I know, a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children, and to be able to give them the confidence that there are—that the hubs are available for them. So, we have seen an increase in children. Those numbers are still small and, I believe, potentially, there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children, whether that—. That vulnerability, of course, can cover a whole range of issues. As I said when we last met, this is a constantly evolving situation. The initial response—local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs. We've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and I am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Hefin, you" />
    <node id="—have specialist services in place, sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child's health and well-being. But perhaps Steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support. Steve.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Yes, myself and colleague Albert Heaney—colleague-director—have been in regular touch with directors of education and directors of social services to make sure that these children and young people's needs are catered for. We are very aware of all of the special schools—profound and multiple learning difficulties, EBD schools and pupil referral units—that have been kept open in their own way, but also, in some cases, as hubs, to deliver those services for those children's needs, and we're pleased that the directors and the local authorities have responded so constructively. So, we have the details of every school that's open, the pupils who are attending, and we are clear that the risk assessments that the Minister referred to for children with special needs, as well as wider vulnerable groups—they are having risk assessments to make sure that, where there is a need identified for a pupil that is" />

The agenda for the evidence session this afternoon includes:&#10;   - A welcome and opening statement from Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education.&#10;   - An appreciation statement from the Minister regarding those who have helped during the pandemic, particularly those who have kept school hubs open, looked after vulnerable children, and the children of key workers.&#10;   - A discussion with Kirsty Williams AM, Steve Davies (director of the education directorate), and Huw Morris (group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning) on the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I determine that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Friday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video conference. A record of the proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation relating to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind all participants that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Can I just then, again, note for the record that, if, for any reason, I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Item 2, then," />
    <node id="1. Teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe each student would have obtained if exams had taken place, based on their coursework, mock examinations, and other work to date.&#10;2. Teachers will also rank students in order of performance.&#10;3. The submitted grades will then be moderated by Qualifications Wales, both within individual schools/colleges and across the nation, to ensure fairness and consistency.&#10;4. This process aims to award students a grade that reflects their performance and allows them to make decisions about their future, while maintaining a robust qualifications system.&#10;5.

For example, how is an appropriate balance being taken between recognising the progress of pupils in their coursework, mock examinations, and other work to date, and also, the potential of pupils who might have performed particularly well in their examinations this summer?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, Janet, I understand—and today is a day where some students would have been undertaking practical examinations—I understand how devastating it has been to both students and teachers alike for the decision I had to take to cancel this summer's exam series. But I'm absolutely clear that was the only decision that could have been reached. Qualifications Wales has made it very clear—and for people who would like more information, I would urge them to look at Qualifications Wales's website—how they will go about giving, allocating, and awarding a grade to our A-level and GCSE students. Firstly, teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe that student would have obtained, should they have taken an exam. And, of course, teachers will have a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade. Teachers will also be asked to rank students in order. Once that information" />
    <node id=" week, to be able to give that greater clarity. So, they have announced that learners due to complete their Essential Skills Wales qualifications will receive results. They have also published their approach to how health and social care qualifications will be managed, because, of course, those are part of the first set of reformed quals that we have done on a Wales basis. You are right, there are a group of students who fall into the category where there are technical qualifications that require a certificate of competency to be industry ready—I hope I've explained that correctly—and, therefore, we are working to understand how we can accommodate those students in these particular circumstances. But, at this stage, there may be some delay for that element of their qualification being delayed to a further date.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes.

For example, how is an appropriate balance being taken between recognising the progress of pupils in their coursework, mock" />

We are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our EdTech investment, using those resources to fill this particular gap.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. We're going to go back to Janet now. I believe we've got sound again, so Janet can ask her questions on examinations. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I thought it was something at this end; I'm glad to hear it wasn't. When will vocational learners know what is happening with their assessments, and how will those who have no choice but to wait for a vocational assessment be supported?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's a very good question, Janet, because I know that there has been some concern and anxiety around vocational qualification students and how quickly we've been able to provide certainty for them. You'll be aware that Qualifications Wales have been able, in the last week, to be able to give that greater clarity. So, they have announced that learners due to complete their Essential Skills Wales qualifications will receive results. They have" />
    <node id=" a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade. Teachers will also be asked to rank students in order. Once that information has been submitted to Qualifications Wales, there will be a process by which that data will be moderated; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation, thus giving us the chance to award a student a fair grade whilst being, and remaining, true to ensuring that we have a robust qualifications system, and allowing those students who find themselves at a critical stage of their education, where they are looking to move on to the next stages—that they will have the grades that will allow them to make decisions about their future.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Janet. We're going to go on now, then, to the questions on higher and further education from Suzy Davies. Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I suppose my first question just goes back to the 16-year-olds at the moment and those who are looking forward to either going to college, the older ones going to university, there'll be apprentices" />
    <node id=" the 16-year-olds at the moment and those who are looking forward to either going to college, the older ones going to university, there'll be apprenticeships, all kinds of future pathways for post 16. What's happening at school level, or even at college level, to get those students ready for the next steps, because, obviously, they're not in their usual environments and getting their usual programme of teaching?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No, that's quite right, Suzy, and I should have said in answer to Janet's question, as well—I'm sure people already know, but just to get the point across—that A-level results day and GCSE day will run as normal across not just Wales, but England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is really important. You're right, Suzy—for those people that are coming to the end of one part of their education this is a particularly challenging time. You'll be aware that, last week, on Hwb, we were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university. I'm very grateful to the HE sector in Wales, who've worked really hard with us on that. So, for instance, if" />
    <node id=" the Universities UK document that explains some of the difficulties that they're going to be running into if this proceeds much further. My understanding is that the main emphasis at the moment is to try and get all the universities across the UK through this initial period of difficulty by releasing as much money as possible. I can see that your figure to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was a little bit down on last year's letter—not that there's been a remit letter yet, but an indication. Are you releasing that money earlier so that they can use it more swiftly, or does that not matter?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Before you come in, Minister, that is going to have to be the last question, just to make you aware of that, because we are coming up to the end of our time.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's fine.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Of course, Suzy, we are working closely with Universities Wales and have a lot of sympathy for the proposals that have come forward from Universities UK, which Wales's universities have been a part of forming.

    <node id="1. Proactively contact the school or local education authority: If parents have not received any communication from the school or local authority regarding support for their vulnerable children with additional learning needs, they should take the initiative and reach out to them. They can contact their local education authority to have a conversation about what support is available to them and their children.&#10;&#10;2. Initiate support conversations: Parents should not hesitate to initiate conversations about supporting their children's additional learning needs. This may involve discussing one-on-one provisions, remote working strategies, or referral mechanisms if teachers or anyone has concerns about the child's well-being.&#10;&#10;3. Seek clarification on risk assessments: If parents are unsure whether their children have been risk assessed for attending support hubs, they should inquire with the school or local authority to ensure that an appropriate risk assessment has been conducted and that necessary measures are taken to support their children's health and well-being.&#10;&#10;4. Maintain regular contact with schools: Parents should encourage schools to maintain regular telephone check-ins with their children, as this can help keep them engaged and supported during this time. This is especially important for young children who may not respond well to remote contact with SEN advisors." />
    <node id=" support is available to them and their children, they should contact their local education authority to have a conversation as to what support is available.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Dawn, final question, please.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes, my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers. Is that a concern for you? I'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on. What kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that doesn't actually play out?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Dawn. All of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap, potentially, will affect those more vulnerable children the most. Clearly, we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like, or as we develop into future phases. Depending on where that child is in their educational journey, of course, the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different. So, for instance, when we're thinking about very young children, we could be thinking about a" />

Hefin, you had a supplementary—briefly, please.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Yes, very quickly. I've been listening to the answers with regard to vulnerable children, following on from that answer. I'm at home with a vulnerable child—a child who has got additional learning needs. She's got autism; she's four. I imagine there are many, many parents in exactly the same position—I've heard from them. I haven't heard anything from the school or from the local authority. Should I have heard something or should I be proactive in pursuing it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I don't want to comment on personal cases—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But there are many others in this position.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: —but what I would say is that if parents have concerns and want to have a conversation about what support is available to them and their children, they should contact their local education authority to have a conversation as to what support is available.&#10;Speaker: Lyn" />

For some of those children who, perhaps, have very intense health needs, actually, staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do, and we're looking to support families, and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families, in a number of ways. We also know that just because you don't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable, and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can—if the age of the child is appropriate—just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children. But we will continue to work across Government to encourage, where it is appropriate, children to attend settings, and, if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting, that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain, and their families remain, supported.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Minister. It's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and" />
    <node id=" to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible, and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly, safely and effectively, we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs. So, firstly, the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages, because parents have been heeding those messages, but, of course, all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home. So, I'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children. So, although numbers are small, they have doubled over the course of the last week. We're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways, and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs. They're also looking to support in other ways. Of course, some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable—and our definition of 'vulnerable' is one that is shared between the systems in England and Wales—could be children with a statement of special educational needs.

    <node id=", the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different. So, for instance, when we're thinking about very young children, we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills. Of course, that, potentially, then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write, for instance. For other children who are, perhaps, older and heading towards formal examinations, the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one. I'm not sure, Chair, whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now, or whether there are questions later.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Well, I've got a question on that coming up, so, if it's okay, Dawn, we'll go on to that now.

I was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources, which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: You're absolutely correct, Chair. Officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time. We are fortunate in the regard that, because of previous decisions and investments, we have a strong base on which to build because we have our Hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of Microsoft Office and Google for Education tools, which are available to all families. We have become the first, I think—we're certainly the first in the UK, and I'm not sure whether we're the first across the world, but I think we probably are—to deploy, for instance, Adobe Spark nationally. But, obviously, access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time. Officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time.&#10;Speaker: Lynne" />
    <node id=": Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Since yesterday, the Welsh Government has started publishing data on the number of schools that are open, the number of children attending those schools, and the number of staff involved, and they have been making this information available as per capita of the population. On average, I think it's 1 per cent of the children of Wales that actually attend these locations, and some 5 per cent of the staff. So, can you analyse those figures a little further? Can you tell us how many children, according to this data, are children of key workers, and how many are vulnerable children?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Siân. As you quite rightly say, on average, we have 518 school hubs open each day, with up to 4,200 children attending. We have seen an increase in the number of attendances since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term. We have approximately 5.6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs, and at present, 85 per cent of the children who are attending are the children of key workers, the remainder being vulnerable children. So, we are now averaging 600 vulnerable children per day. These are" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, it appears that there has been an increase in the number of vulnerable children attending schools during the crisis and lockdown. After the Easter break, the number of vulnerable children doubled, but this does not necessarily mean that all of these children were new to the schools or hubs. Some of them may have been previously enrolled but did not attend over the break.&#10;&#10;The Welsh Government has been publishing data on the number of schools open and the number of children attending, with an average of 1% of children in Wales attending these locations and 5% of the staff. Of the children attending, 85% are children of key workers, while the remaining 15% are vulnerable children. This translates to approximately 600 vulnerable children per day.&#10;&#10;It is also mentioned that there has been an evolution in the approach to supporting vulnerable children since the start of the crisis, with local authorities and schools working quickly to set up hubs. The situation continues to evolve, and the Welsh Government expects schools to remain in contact with children, identify vulnerable children, and refer them to children's services if needed." />

These are small numbers, but we have seen an increase in those numbers since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. I'm sure we'll return to that point a little later on. How much confidence do you therefore have that the arrangements are effective in terms of the safety of staff and children at these locations?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you once again for that. The smooth operation of the hubs, with regard to health and safety, is, of course, of paramount importance. What we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function—we have seen a change of pattern over time. So, following my announcement on, I believe, 18 March, the week after, we saw a large number of settings open and operating. As local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places—from critical workers and vulnerable children—we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model, and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on" />
    <node id="1. Maintain contact and discuss support: Even if the school or local authority has not reached out, parents should proactively contact them to discuss available support for their children with additional learning needs. This may include one-on-one provisions, remote working strategies, or referral mechanisms if there are concerns about the child's well-being.&#10;2. Flexible counselling and therapy: Local authorities can use allocated financial resources flexibly to provide various forms of counselling and therapy that best suit individual children and families, including remote counseling and, when possible, enhanced family therapy.&#10;3. Support for health needs: For children with intense health needs who must stay at home, local authorities and education systems are looking for ways to support them and their families in various ways, including regular check-ins and telephone contact.&#10;4. Guidelines for parents: The 'Stay Safe. Stay Learning' policy statement provides advice to parents and carers on the Hwb platform regarding supporting their children's learning at home. However, specific guidelines on recommended hours of home learning or volume of work per day have not been explicitly mentioned in the transcript.&#10;5. Increased demand for services: Additional financial resources are being made available to local authorities to increase and ramp up services to support children and families during this time, including potential growth in the number of children requiring support due to fears and anxieties related to the pandemic situation. There is a recognition that some traditional methods of delivering services may not be possible due to social distancing rules, but efforts are being made to put systems in place now and plan for future increased demand." />

Just a final question from me: how exactly are we communicating to parents what the expectations are of them in terms of delivering this education at home now? Are there, for example, guidelines on recommended hours of home learning per day of the week or volume of work to be completed? How are we ensuring that parents know how best to lead their children through this at the moment?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Firstly, can I recognise what a challenge this is? We've just heard from Hefin who is carrying on his day job as the Assembly Member, but is obviously trying to do that as well as care for and provide learning for his children, and I know, Chair, that you're doing the same, and I'm certainly trying to do the same, and it's a real challenge, it's not easy.

Again, it's probably a four-nation approach, I would imagine.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Suzy. You are correct to say that our student support regime does allow for a lower payment to be made to those students that stay at home during their studies, but I want to reassure students that there will be no change to their student support payments just because they have left their universities and have decided to go home. There should be no change. Also, we are continuing, it should be important to say, to pay education maintenance allowance at this time for our FE students that are eligible for that, even though, obviously, for EMA there is an attendance requirement, but clearly that is not appropriate to enforce at the moment. You are correct—this is a worrying time for many students in higher education, especially for those who are looking to graduate at this time and are going out into an economy that has been tremendously badly hit by the pandemic.

Are they likely to be asked to reimburse part of the cost, because obviously it's not as expensive to live at home as away, and what's likely to be happening with the maintenance loans over the summer holiday period, potentially? Because we've had a period now where students can't top up their maintenance loans by going out and working on weekends or working in the evenings, or whatever, so their income has been impacted.

We are continuing—on our webpage we have a frequently asked questions section that advises students in the first instance, especially when it comes, for instance, to the cost of accommodation—to have those discussions, and I'm very grateful that, in some cases, some of our institutions have been able to waive or partially waive accommodation fees where students have vacated their accommodation and have returned to their usual home address. But we will continue to have dialogue with NUS Wales and with our counterparts across the country to look to see what more we can do to support students at this time.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you for that answer, and, yes, I was pleased to see that announcement through the NUS as well, so well done to those accommodation providers who have a heart.

Stability in the first instance is really important to us, which is why we've been able to give an indication to HEFCW about resources that are available, and we've been very clear to HEFCW that we want to be as flexible as possible in how they use those resources to support institutions. That potentially would mean reprofiling the way in which money gets out to institutions, but clearly we will need to have an ongoing discussion about how we respond to the immediacy of the issues facing HE, how we can get stability for the next academic year, and how we then can support the sector through what is a really challenging time for them. We will do that in a Welsh context and we will continue to do that also in a UK context, because you will have seen the scale of some of the figures that have been talked about in terms of the impact on the HE sector at this time.

But I want to be absolutely clear: we are working with representatives of the HE sector to include them in this work.

So, there is a range of activities and courses available for year 13, so that children—'children'; they're all children to me—young people can get themselves—. They don't have to stop learning, and they can get themselves ready for the next stage of their education. Again, for those children, perhaps, who are coming to the end of their GCSEs, there is a range of information, either within their own schools or within their local colleges about things that can keep them learning. So, for instance, I'm aware of one school" />

I think the really important message that I've been trying to give to parents is not to be too hard on ourselves. I know that everybody is doing the best that they can in really challenging circumstances. And if they have concerns, they should be in contact with their child's school, but we do have specific advice and guidance to parents on the Hwb platform.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We're going to move on now to some questions on examinations from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet, we can't hear you. I tell you what, we'll—. Janet, do you want to try again? No. Okay, we'll go on then to questions on higher education and post 16, and we'll come back to examinations, if that's okay. Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, thank you, Chair.

    <node id="1. The Welsh Government, in collaboration with Universities Wales and representatives of the Welsh higher education sector, is aiming to provide stability for the next academic year and support the sector through these challenging times by releasing as much money as possible to help universities get through this initial period of difficulty. This aligns with one of the key proposals from Universities UK, which emphasizes the need for financial support to ensure university sustainability.&#10;2. The Welsh Government is also participating in discussions with relevant bodies in Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the Westminster Government, as well as UCAS, to address issues related to student entry into universities due to the pandemic. This includes discussions on the moratorium on unconditional offers for university admission, which is another concern raised by Universities UK.&#10;3. Additionally, the Welsh Government is working with NUS Wales and counterparts across the UK to provide financial support for students impacted by changes in their study arrangements due to the pandemic. This addresses another issue raised by Universities UK, which highlights the need for student financial support during this time. The Welsh Government's efforts demonstrate a commitment to addressing the challenges faced by both universities and students in light of the pandemic, with measures that are consistent with the proposals put forward by Universities UK." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is aware of the digital divide issue and is working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to necessary hardware and connectivity for remote learning.&#10;2. They have purchased software to convert old pieces of equipment into out-of-the-box Chromebooks, utilizing existing stock in schools and local authorities.&#10;3. A national level purchase and distribution of Mi-Fi connectivity will be made to address connectivity issues, providing Wi-Fi access for students who lack it.&#10;4. These measures aim to ensure equal opportunity and access to learning during this time, reducing inequality due to varying digital resources." />
    <node id=" I just ask this one question?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: No, that's fine. Yes, go on.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Your comment, Minister, on working with local authorities to make sure that individuals have hardware: can you just give us a bit of detail on what working with local authorities actually means? In the process of that, is there any data gathering going on for those pupils who are being educated at home and the levels at which they're engaging? You know, are they sticking with it, or how many are dropping out? Because I think the two of those perhaps go together.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely. So, I'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow, if not later on this week, about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity. We're working closely with local authorities to understand just that: to understand from the schools the number of schools that—and a number of them have already done this—have been lending Chromebooks, iPads and laptops to children, and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available. And we'll be doing two things to support local authorities. The first" />
    <node id=" and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available. And we'll be doing two things to support local authorities. The first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students. So, we have purchased on a national basis software that, when applied to an old piece of kit, essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box Chromebook. Because, as you can imagine, just like other things during a pandemic, there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need. So, we're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities, and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our EdTech investment programme. The other issue is, once a child has a Chromebook or a laptop or a device, issues around connectivity. So, we're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute Mi-Fi connectivity, so students will be able to have access to Wi-Fi where they don't have that already. That's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff" />
    <node id="1. Dawn Bowden AM is temporarily chairing the committee while Lynne Neagle AM tries to rejoin the meeting.&#10;2. The agenda for this afternoon's evidence session includes:&#10;   - A welcome and opening statement from Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education.&#10;   - An appreciation statement from the Minister regarding those who have helped during the pandemic, particularly those who have kept school hubs open, looked after vulnerable children, and the children of key workers.&#10;   - A discussion with Kirsty Williams AM, Steve Davies (director of the education directorate), and Huw Morris (group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning) on the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is working closely with local authorities to understand the number of schools that have been lending technological devices such as Chromebooks, iPads, and laptops to children. This collaboration aims to identify children who are not engaging in remote learning activities and assess the level of need for hardware and connectivity support.&#10;2. To ensure resources reach the right children effectively, the Government is trying to do this on a national basis by deploying required technological resources to local authorities. This approach aims to assist local authorities in obtaining necessary resources in the crowded market.&#10;3. The Government is repurposing some of the previously identified resources from their EdTech investment to fill the gaps in hardware and connectivity support, particularly for children who do not have access to technology for remote learning." />
    <node id=" don't have that already. That's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children. One of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education. So, if a child hasn't been engaging, is that because they just don't want to and they're voting with their feet—but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that—or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that, and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children? So, rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need, we're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities. So, our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what's already happened, and there is very good practice out there—schools have been proactive—but where there are gaps, what can we do as a national Government to be able to assist them to do that? We are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our EdTech investment, using those resources to fill this" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcripts, the Welsh Government is not currently considering a relaxation of truancy rules or providing specific guidance for schools regarding relaxing attendance requirements. Instead, the focus is on ensuring appropriate referral mechanisms are in place for teachers or anyone who has concerns about a child, and that schools should continue to identify vulnerable children and refer them to children's services if needed. Schools are expected to remain in contact with children during this time. While there has been no explicit mention of relaxing lockdown rules for children, the Welsh Government seems open to considering measures to support these children in future phases of education in the new normal. The main emphasis is on ensuring stability for the next academic year and supporting the education sector through these challenging times by releasing as much money as possible to help institutions get through this initial period of difficulty." />
    <node id="The Welsh Government is actively addressing the risk of inequality in children's education rights during the pandemic by recognizing the importance of equal opportunity and access to learning. They are aware of the potential increase in the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers due to unequal access to technology. Officials are working with local authorities to ensure all children have access to necessary hardware and connectivity, which is crucial for continued learning and the deployment of tools like Adobe Spark nationally. This proactive approach aims to prevent the attainment gap from widening and ensure that every child in Wales has equal opportunities in education during these challenging times." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is working on several fronts to address the challenges faced by students due to the pandemic. This includes providing financial support for students impacted by changes in their study arrangements and advising them to discuss waiving or partially waiving accommodation fees with providers.&#10;2. Discussions are taking place between relevant bodies in Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the Westminster Government, as well as UCAS, to address issues related to student entry into universities due to the pandemic.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is working with NUS Wales and counterparts across the UK to provide financial support for students.&#10;4. Teachers in Wales will submit estimated grades for A-level and GCSE qualifications based on a range of data and professional judgment, which will then be moderated by Qualifications Wales to ensure fairness and consistency.&#10;5. Suzy Davies AM acknowledges the efforts of some accommodation providers who have waived or partially waived fees for students and mentions the Universities UK document detailing difficulties faced by universities during the pandemic. She also confirms that the Welsh Government is continuing dialogue with NUS Wales and counterparts across the country to explore further support for students.&#10;&#10;In response to the question, while there is no specific mention of measures addressing the cancellation of programs such as the Yale global summer school, the Welsh Government is making efforts to ensure students continue to have access to resources and advice for learning and future decision-making through various financial support initiatives, discussions on student entry into universities, and maintaining a robust qualifications system for awarding A-level and GCSE qualifications." />
    <node id="1. Professional Expectations for Reporting and Referring Cases: There is a professional expectation for all those working with children and young people, including in specialist hubs, to continue reporting and referring cases if they have concerns about a child's welfare and safety. This responsibility applies even during the current circumstances when face-to-face contact may be limited.&#10;2. Challenges in Specialist Hubs: Specialist hubs for children with additional learning needs can present challenges related to staffing. These hubs often operate on a rota basis, which means that children might interact with staff they are unfamiliar with, potentially impacting their health and well-being.&#10;3. Importance of Maintaining Communication: To support children with additional learning needs during this time, it is essential for schools to maintain regular contact with them. This can help keep children engaged and supported, especially for young children who might not respond well to remote contact with SEN advisors.&#10;4. Risk Assessments: If parents are unsure whether their children have been risk-assessed for attending support hubs, they should inquire with the school or local authority to ensure that appropriate risk assessments have been conducted and necessary measures are taken to support their children's health and well-being.&#10;5. Lockdown Rules and SEN Children: While there has been no specific mention of relaxing lockdown rules for children with special educational needs, the Welsh Government is open to considering measures to support these children in future phases of education in the new normal." />
    <node id=" is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that, despite the circumstances they find themselves in, they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child's welfare and safety. With regard to children with additional learning needs, I am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children, and perhaps Steve Davies could give some further details. We have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision, where that is appropriate—so, if I could give you an example of my own local authority in Powys, they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs, and those centres are available—recognising, however, that, even with the provision of specialist hubs, it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine. Hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with. So, even when local authorities—and the vast, vast majority of them do—have specialist services in place, sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child's health and well-being. But perhaps Steve can give us further" />
    <edge source="1. Phased return: The Welsh government officials mentioned that the return to school will be phased, with priority given to the most vulnerable children, such as those with additional learning needs.&#10;&#10;2. Communication and confidence: A key challenge is ensuring clear communication with parents, staff, and students to build confidence in returning to school. This will involve providing evidence and information on which decisions are based, so that parents and staff feel assured of their safety.&#10;&#10;3. Safety measures: Decisions about reopening schools will be made considering the safety and well-being of children, young people, and staff. Measures may include social distancing, enhanced cleaning procedures, and altered school layouts to minimize contact between individuals.&#10;&#10;4. Testing and tracing: Widespread testing, tracing, and quarantine capabilities will be crucial in the next phase of managing the pandemic, as they are essential for ensuring safety in all aspects of society, including schools.&#10;&#10;5. Workforce availability: Ensuring adequate numbers of staff is a significant challenge, as some may be unable to return due to health concerns or other commitments. Strategies for addressing this issue will need to be developed and implemented.&#10;&#10;6. Social distancing in school settings: Implementing social distancing measures in schools will be challenging, given the young age and close proximity of many students. Creative solutions, such as staggered schedules, may be necessary to address this issue.&#10;&#10;7. School transportation: Ensuring safe transportation for students will require careful planning and management, including reduced capacity on buses and other forms of transport to maintain social distancing.&#10;&#10;8. Gathering at school gates: Preventing gatherings at school gates will be important for minimizing the risk of infection. Strategies may include designated drop-off and pick-up areas, as well as staggered arrival and dismissal times.&#10;&#10;9. No immediate return to normal: The government officials stressed that a return to normal education is not imminent, and it is crucial to avoid giving false expectations about when schools will fully reopen." target=" have to be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic. Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff, on the information that we have used to reach any decisions, to build confidence for parents and professionals, but also to give them time to plan. It will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working. And we also have to look at—and it's been paraphrased quite a lot today—if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting, which groups they should be. And, finally, how do we operationalise that? How do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be, and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available, to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education, school transport issues, how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate, for instance? So, there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of">

Similarly, with special educational needs, whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school, and they may not respond as well to remote working, or remote contact, with an SEN advisor, are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, first of all, Dawn, you're absolutely right: my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children, and schools should continue to refer children to children's services if they have any concerns, and that would also, of course, be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children.

So, there has been, I know, a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children, and to be able to give them the confidence that there are—that the hubs are available for them. So, we have seen an increase in children. Those numbers are still small and, I believe, potentially, there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children, whether that—. That vulnerability, of course, can cover a whole range of issues. As I said when we last met, this is a constantly evolving situation. The initial response—local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs. We've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and I am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Hefin, you">

In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I determine that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Friday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video conference. A record of the proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation relating to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind all participants that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Can I just then, again, note for the record that, if, for any reason, I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin?

So, for instance, if you were a year 13 student or even a year 12 student that was thinking about or interested in areas around social policy, you could have tuned into a social policy lecturer at Swansea University. If you go to the Hwb website, you will be able to see that there are subject listings, everything from animal science through to law, politics, history and science, with links through to higher education and further education courses that students can avail themselves of. There's also a section on preparation for essential study skills, whether that is report writing or academic writing. So, there is a range of activities and courses available for year 13, so that children—'children'; they're all children to me—young people can get themselves—. They don't have to stop learning, and they can get themselves ready for the next stage of their education. Again, for those children, perhaps, who are coming to the end of their GCSEs, there is a range of information, either within their own schools or within their local colleges about things that can keep them learning.

The Welsh Government, in collaboration with Universities Wales and representatives of the Welsh higher education sector, is aiming to provide stability for the next academic year and support the sector through these challenging times by releasing as much money as possible to help universities get through this initial period of difficulty. This aligns with one of the key proposals from Universities UK, which emphasizes the need for financial support to ensure university sustainability.&#10;2. The Welsh Government is also participating in discussions with relevant bodies in Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the Westminster Government, as well as UCAS, to address issues related to student entry into universities due to the pandemic. This includes discussions on the moratorium on unconditional offers for university admission, which is another concern raised by Universities UK.&#10;3. Additionally, the Welsh Government is working with NUS Wales and counterparts across the UK to provide financial support for students impacted by changes in their study arrangements due to the pandemic. This addresses another issue raised by Universities UK, which highlights the need for student financial support during this time. The Welsh Government's efforts demonstrate a commitment to addressing the challenges faced by both universities and students in light of the pandemic, with measures that are consistent with the proposals put forward by Universities UK." target="Based on the meeting transcripts, the Welsh Government is not currently considering a relaxation of truancy rules or providing specific guidance for schools regarding relaxing attendance requirements. Instead, the focus is on ensuring appropriate referral mechanisms are in place for teachers or anyone who has concerns about a child, and that schools should continue to identify vulnerable children and refer them to children's services if needed. Schools are expected to remain in contact with children during this time. While there has been no explicit mention of relaxing lockdown rules for children, the Welsh Government seems open to considering measures to support these children in future phases of education in the new normal. The main emphasis is on ensuring stability for the next academic year and supporting the education sector through these challenging times by releasing as much money as possible to help institutions get through this initial period of difficulty.">

That's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children. One of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education. So, if a child hasn't been engaging, is that because they just don't want to and they're voting with their feet—but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that—or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that, and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children? So, rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need, we're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities. So, our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what's already happened, and there is very good practice out there—schools have been proactive—but where there are gaps, what can we do as a national Government to be able to assist them to do that?

Professional Expectations for Reporting and Referring Cases: There is a professional expectation for all those working with children and young people, including in specialist hubs, to continue reporting and referring cases if they have concerns about a child's welfare and safety. This responsibility applies even during the current circumstances when face-to-face contact may be limited.&#10;2. Challenges in Specialist Hubs: Specialist hubs for children with additional learning needs can present challenges related to staffing. These hubs often operate on a rota basis, which means that children might interact with staff they are unfamiliar with, potentially impacting their health and well-being.&#10;3. Importance of Maintaining Communication: To support children with additional learning needs during this time, it is essential for schools to maintain regular contact with them. This can help keep children engaged and supported, especially for young children who might not respond well to remote contact with SEN advisors.&#10;4. Risk Assessments: If parents are unsure whether their children have been risk-assessed for attending support hubs, they should inquire with the school or local authority to ensure that appropriate risk assessments have been conducted and necessary measures are taken to support their children's health and well-being.&#10;5.

With regard to children with additional learning needs, I am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children, and perhaps Steve Davies could give some further details. We have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision, where that is appropriate—so, if I could give you an example of my own local authority in Powys, they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs, and those centres are available—recognising, however, that, even with the provision of specialist hubs, it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine. Hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with. So, even when local authorities—and the vast, vast majority of them do—have specialist services in place, sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child's health and well-being.

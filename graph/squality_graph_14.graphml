I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the fire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets and mattress and started to roll them up.

He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him and reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from behind and pinned my arms to my side.&#10; &#10; I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly hand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a lungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I'm told—but he didn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet and dragged me off.&#10; &#10; When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped dragging me and dropped me in a heap. &quot;Make any noise,&quot; he said, &quot;and I'll hurt you.&quot;&#10; &#10; That was a silly way to put it, but" />

His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he didn't want to be fried.&#10; &#10; I said, &quot;Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.&quot;&#10; &#10; They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.&#10; &#10; When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, &quot;All right, let's go.&quot;&#10; &#10; They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I could see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with narrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling tones said, &quot;Look here, kid....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up,&quot; I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did.

There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I felt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I whomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.&#10; &#10; I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk again.

    <node id=", I was sick. My hands were cold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to a gallop.&#10; &#10; I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all stone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were no machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the edge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the window—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.&#10; &#10; But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't see one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There were little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All the boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why Horst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but I decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the clocks tick on this planet.&#10; &#10; But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God!

It left him a latitude of things to do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight for that. &quot;I ought to club you anyway,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting the animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what we can use.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other one didn't move. &quot;Get going, Jack,&quot; Horst said in a menacing tone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally backed down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me being kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his bunch.&#10; &#10; But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under my jacket.&#10; &#10; Horst turned back to me and I said, &quot;" />

First, the gravity is always wrong on planets, which makes her arches and calves ache or makes her feel like she might trip and break her neck. Additionally, she finds the presence of vegetables and small, grubby creatures that crawl around to be creepy and unpleasant. However, what bothers her the most is the smell of every planet, which she describes as being pervasively unpleasant.

I cried when I said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that wasn't in public.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really, because I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me unhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month. Planets make me feel wretched.&#10; &#10; The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and calves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on a piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere and little grubby things just looking for you to crawl on. If you can think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty imagination.

We swung over the sea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested hills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They don't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his gear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still smarting from the slap I'd given him.&#10; &#10; In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see Jimmy—if he would get back alive.&#10; &#10; It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the nearest colonized planet and come back one month later.

They don't let us grow for fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They do figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time you're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to the Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship is a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that something has to be done in a closed society to keep the population from decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to keep the population steady.&#10; &#10; I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be found at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes. Venie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start getting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next landing, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly.

Its gray-blue color was almost the color of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the lights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in the dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach if it's really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in thirty gone.&#10; &#10; I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three things in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others. The first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot I could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to camp out, as nasty as that would be" />

    <node id="In the story &quot;Down to the Worlds of Men&quot; by Alexei Panshin, horses played a significant role in the survival and success of approximately half of the colonies established during the sixteen-year period after the first Great Ship was completed in 2025. This is because, as the text explains, there was not enough time to set up industry on these newly established colonies, so they had to have draft animals to help with various tasks such as transportation and labor.&#10;&#10;&#09;The text highlights the smart decision to include horses in the colonization plan, as they were able to fulfill the role of draft animals that would have otherwise been performed by machines or other domesticable animals that may not have been available on these new planets. The narrator also mentions that they came across &quot;travelers&quot; herding a group of creatures on their journey, and notes that she would have had trouble keeping those creatures on her stomach if she had tried to eat them, further emphasizing the importance of horses as a reliable source of food in these new environments.&#10;&#10;&#09;Overall, horses were likely a crucial factor for colonization because they provided a reliable source of labor, transportation, and food for the settlers, allowing approximately half of the colonies established during this time period to survive and thrive." />

I brought Ninc down off the hillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching it in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a hard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks of horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't identify.&#10; &#10; One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when they dropped the colonies. I say &quot;they&quot; because, while we did the actual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on Earth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were established, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have draft animals.&#10; &#10; The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025.

At the next bend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and the creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.&#10; &#10; I put this episode in the &quot;file and hold for analysis&quot; section in my mind and rode on, feeling good.

Additionally, she compares the unpleasantness of planets, such as the pervasive unpleasant smell, unavoidable grubby creatures, and gravity differences, to the relative ease of avoiding such issues on a spaceship. Despite these challenges, Mia and other colonists participate in this tradition as part of their societal norms and expectations for becoming responsible and self-reliant adults who can contribute positively to the Ship's population." />

This illustrates how the narrator makes assumptions about people based on their physical appearance and demonstrates her wariness in this unfamiliar and potentially dangerous environment." />

    <node id="1. Observation: The narrator observes the man's hard face and perceives him as a potential threat. This observation leads the narrator to be cautious around the man.&#10;2. Asking discrete questions to trusted individuals: The narrator does not explicitly do this in the passage, but it could be a useful strategy in a real-life situation. For instance, if the narrator had encountered someone they trusted later, they could ask about the man and his reputation.&#10;3. Analyzing available documents or materials: Again, this is not directly applicable to the passage, but it could help in similar situations. For example, if there were reports of the man's behavior, analyzing them could provide valuable information.&#10;4. Building trust and rapport: This strategy would not apply in this situation since the man threatens the narrator.&#10;5. Utilizing technology: The narrator does not have access to any technology that could help them in this situation.&#10;&#10;When threatened by someone who believes they are above the law, one should try to remain calm and avoid escalating the situation. In this passage, the narrator tries to defuse the situation by answering the man's questions politely. However, when the man becomes aggressive, the narrator retaliates, leading to a physical altercation. While it is important to stand up for oneself, doing so without escalating the situation can be challenging. If possible, one should try to remove themselves from the dangerous situation and seek help from authorities or trusted individuals." />

    <node id="1. The speaker, Mia Havero, declined Jimmy Dentremont's offer to partner up for their month-long exploration of Tintera due to personal reasons (her grudge over a comment he made about her being a snob) and strategic concerns (she perceives him as her competition and wants to increase her chances of survival). Instead, she chose to ride Ninc and cut Venie out from joining them.&#10;2. If Mia couldn't find a slot for her month-long exploration, alternative options could include:&#10;* Partnering with someone else her age who is not in direct competition with her.&#10;* Joining an older or more experienced group and learning from them during the expedition.&#10;* Postponing her Trial until a later time when she feels more prepared or has found a suitable partner.&#10;* Seeking additional training or preparing more thoroughly before attempting the Trial again.&#10;&#10;The context of potential conflicts with Jimmy Dentremont doesn't significantly change Mia's alternatives, as she has already made up her mind not to partner with him. Her decision might have been influenced by her personal preference for solitude, her need to prove herself capable of surviving independently, or a desire to avoid any complications that could arise from partnering with her competition." />
    <node id="1. Careful observation: The narrator can pay close attention to people's behaviors, actions, and interactions, which might provide clues about what is happening without directly asking questions. This strategy is already mentioned in the passage as the narrator observes the man's hard face and perceives him as a potential threat.&#10;2. Analyzing available documents or materials: If there are any written records, reports, or other documentation available, studying them can help uncover important information related to the situation. For example, the narrator could look for official reports, newsletters, or other publications within the colony that may provide insights.&#10;3. Building trust and rapport: Over time, by establishing relationships with people involved in the situation, the narrator might gain access to valuable information as trust is earned. This strategy would require patience and tact, but it could be a reliable way to learn more about the situation.&#10;4. Utilizing technology (if available): Depending on the context, using discreet recording devices or other technology may help gather information without directly asking questions. However, it's important to be aware of any legal or ethical considerations when using such methods. The narrator in the story does not have access to technology that could help her in this situation.&#10;5. Seeking advice from trusted individuals: Although the narrator does not explicitly do this in the passage, she could look for someone she trusts who might be more knowledgeable about the situation or have connections to people who can provide information. This approach may involve indirect questions or seeking guidance without directly addressing the withheld information.&#10;6. Leveraging existing social structures: In a closed society like the Ship, there might be established ways of sharing and accessing information through community meetings, elders, or other formal or informal channels. The narrator could explore these options to learn more about what's going on without resorting to risky eavesdropping or direct questioning." />

The dangers associated with this practice include gravity differences on planets, which can cause injuries or even death; unpleasant smells and creatures, which could be off-putting or disturbing; the unavoidable nature of these issues on planets compared to the ease of avoiding them on a spaceship; and the risk of not surviving the month on the planet due to various hazards and challenges that must be faced without assistance.

This practice is designed to test their survival skills and self-reliance, ensuring that they can contribute to the closed society of the Ship and prevent mental and physical decay of the population. It also helps maintain a steady population size by limiting the number of people who can go to the planet at once (in this case, only two).&#10;2. Venie Morlock got ready to go after seeing the speaker's preparations because she might have misunderstood Mia's intentions or thought that Mia was inviting her to join.

George Fuhonin, the pilot, created a thrilling experience by dropping the ship suddenly, causing the narrator's stomach to turn flips. This action made George seem like a &quot;hot pilot,&quot; enjoying the excitement of his role, which the narrator found both exhilarating and slightly worrying. The dangerous maneuver also reinforced the idea that there is always an element of risk in these missions, even if the pilots are skilled and experienced.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when the narrator sees the scoutship returning to Tintera while she's on her trial, she initially feels relieved, unsure of what had gone wrong. George Fuhonin's distinctive flying style confirms his presence in the ship. The return of the scoutship and George's actions could imply that there might be unforeseen circumstances or dangers on Tintera, making the Council concerned for the young people's safety during their trial. However, it is also possible that George's visit was routine and unrelated to any specific issues on Tintera. Regardless, his presence served as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with being dropped on a planet for the Trial." />

Careful observation: The narrator can pay close attention to people's behaviors, actions, and interactions, which might provide clues about what is happening without directly asking questions. This strategy is already mentioned in the passage as the narrator observes the man's hard face and perceives him as a potential threat.&#10;2. Analyzing available documents or materials: If there are any written records, reports, or other documentation available, studying them can help uncover important information related to the situation. For example, the narrator could look for official reports, newsletters, or other publications within the colony that may provide insights.&#10;3. Building trust and rapport: Over time, by establishing relationships with people involved in the situation, the narrator might gain access to valuable information as trust is earned. This strategy would require patience and tact, but it could be a reliable way to learn more about the situation.&#10;4. Utilizing technology (if available): Depending on the context, using discreet recording devices or other technology may help gather information without directly asking questions. However, it's important to be aware of any legal or ethical considerations when using such methods. The narrator in the story does not have access to technology that could help her in this situation.&#10;5. Seeking advice from trusted individuals: Although the narrator does not explicitly do this in the passage, she could look for someone she trusts who might be more knowledgeable about the situation or have connections to people who can provide information. This approach may involve indirect questions or seeking guidance without directly addressing the withheld information.&#10;6. Leveraging existing social structures: In a closed society like the Ship, there might be established ways of sharing and accessing information through community meetings, elders, or other formal or informal channels. The narrator could explore these options to learn more about what's going on without resorting to risky eavesdropping or direct questioning.">

This practice is meant to ensure that they can contribute to the closed society of the Ship, prevent mental and physical decay of the population, and help maintain a steady population size. The potential dangers associated with this practice include gravity differences on planets, unpleasant smells and creatures, and the risk of not surviving the month on the planet due to various hazards and challenges that must be faced without assistance.&#10;&#10;In the story, the narrator and her group, including Jimmy D., were dropped on Tintera for their Trial. George Fuhonin, the pilot, created a thrilling experience by dropping the ship suddenly, causing the narrator's stomach to turn flips. This action made George seem like a &quot;hot pilot,&quot; enjoying the excitement of his role, which the narrator found both exhilarating and slightly worrying. The dangerous maneuver also reinforced the idea that there is always an element of risk in these missions, even if the pilots are skilled and experienced.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when the narrator sees the scoutship returning to Tintera while she's on her trial, she initially feels relieved, unsure of what had gone wrong. George Fuhonin's distinctive flying style confirms his presence in the ship. The return of the scoutship and George's actions could imply that there might be unforeseen circumstances or dangers on Tintera, making the Council concerned for the young people's safety during their trial. However, it is also possible that George's visit was routine and unrelated to any specific issues on Tintera. Regardless, his presence served as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with being dropped on a planet for the Trial.">

The narrator also mentions that they came across &quot;travelers&quot; herding a group of creatures on their journey, and notes that she would have had trouble keeping those creatures on her stomach if she had tried to eat them, further emphasizing the importance of horses as a reliable source of food in these new environments.&#10;&#10;&#09;Overall, horses were likely a crucial factor for colonization because they provided a reliable source of labor, transportation, and food for the settlers, allowing approximately half of the colonies established during this time period to survive and thrive.">

The return of the scoutship and George's actions could imply that there might be unforeseen circumstances or dangers on Tintera, making the Council concerned for the young people's safety during their trial. However, it is also possible that George's visit was routine and unrelated to any specific issues on Tintera. Regardless, his presence served as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with being dropped on a planet for the Trial.">

While it is important to stand up for oneself, doing so without escalating the situation can be challenging. If possible, one should try to remove themselves from the dangerous situation and seek help from authorities or trusted individuals." target="1. Careful observation: The narrator can pay close attention to people's behaviors, actions, and interactions, which might provide clues about what is happening without directly asking questions. This strategy is already mentioned in the passage as the narrator observes the man's hard face and perceives him as a potential threat.&#10;2. Analyzing available documents or materials: If there are any written records, reports, or other documentation available, studying them can help uncover important information related to the situation. For example, the narrator could look for official reports, newsletters, or other publications within the colony that may provide insights.&#10;3. Building trust and rapport: Over time, by establishing relationships with people involved in the situation, the narrator might gain access to valuable information as trust is earned. This strategy would require patience and tact, but it could be a reliable way to learn more about the situation.&#10;4. Utilizing technology (if available): Depending on the context, using discreet recording devices or other technology may help gather information without directly asking questions. However, it's important to be aware of any legal or ethical considerations when using such methods. The narrator in the story does not have access to technology that could help her in this situation.&#10;5. Seeking advice from trusted individuals: Although the narrator does not explicitly do this in the passage, she could look for someone she trusts who might be more knowledgeable about the situation or have connections to people who can provide information. This approach may involve indirect questions or seeking guidance without directly addressing the withheld information.&#10;6. Leveraging existing social structures: In a closed society like the Ship, there might be established ways of sharing and accessing information through community meetings, elders, or other formal or informal channels. The narrator could explore these options to learn more about what's going on without resorting to risky eavesdropping or direct questioning.">

    <edge source="1. Observation: The narrator observes the man's hard face and perceives him as a potential threat. This observation leads the narrator to be cautious around the man.&#10;2. Asking discrete questions to trusted individuals: The narrator does not explicitly do this in the passage, but it could be a useful strategy in a real-life situation. For instance, if the narrator had encountered someone they trusted later, they could ask about the man and his reputation.&#10;3. Analyzing available documents or materials: Again, this is not directly applicable to the passage, but it could help in similar situations. For example, if there were reports of the man's behavior, analyzing them could provide valuable information.&#10;4.

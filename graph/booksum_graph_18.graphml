    <node id=" The &quot;lady&quot; in this narrative is Jane Eyre, and she does not actually threaten to do anything after her mother's death. Instead, the passage describes Jane's thoughts and feelings as she reflects on her strained relationship with her aunt, Mrs. Reed. Jane feels determined to subdue her aunt and be mistress of the situation, despite their mutual animosity.&#10;&#10;Jane considers the other person (Mrs. Reed) to be selfish and heartless because of the way she has treated Jane throughout her life. Mrs. Reed had promised to raise Jane as her own child but broke that promise, sending her away to a boarding school where she was mistreated and ostracized. Later in the passage, Mrs. Reed also refuses to help Jane by providing the address of Jane's uncle, who has expressed a desire to adopt and provide for her. Mrs. Reed's cold and unfeeling behavior towards Jane throughout the narrative has led Jane to view her as selfish and heartless." />
    <node id="&#10;that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I&#10;explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am very ill, I know,&quot; she said ere long.  &quot;I was trying to turn myself&#10;a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I&#10;should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,&#10;burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?&#10;or is there no one in the room but you?&quot;&#10;&#10;I assured her we were alone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in&#10;breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own&#10;child; the other--&quot; she stopped.  &quot;After all, it is of no great&#10;importance, perhaps,&quot; she murmured to herself: &quot;and then I may get&#10;better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.&quot;&#10;&#10;She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;&#10;she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor," />
    <node id=" her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of&#10;running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead&#10;before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very&#10;different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How long will you stay?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As short a time as possible, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Promise me only to stay a week--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any&#10;pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, she has sent her coachman.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A person to be trusted?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;" />
    <node id=" painful.&quot;&#10;&#10;She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;&#10;she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,&#10;of the last pang.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell&#10;her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see&#10;there.&quot;&#10;&#10;I obeyed her directions.  &quot;Read the letter,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;It was short, and thus conceived:--&#10;&#10;   &quot;Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my&#10;   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to&#10;   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has&#10;   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried&#10;   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at&#10;   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&#10;&#10;   &quot;JOHN EYRE, Madeira.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was" />
    <node id=" by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.&#10;Neither of us had dropt a tear.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you&#10;had no relations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me&#10;off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was&#10;talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the&#10;veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of&#10;the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago&#10;in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his&#10;family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked&#10;his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of&#10;running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead&#10;" />
    <node id=" that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her&#10;hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should&#10;at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable&#10;natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily&#10;eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather&#10;from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so&#10;icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was&#10;unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to&#10;tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me&#10;bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous&#10;pleasure: only a sense of mortification.&#10;&#10;I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to&#10;subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.&#10;My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their&#10;source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down" />
    <node id=" The sick lady that Jane Eyre, as Mrs. Reed's niece, has been asked to visit is Mrs. Reed herself, who lives in ---shire, which is a hundred miles away from where Jane currently resides. The significance of their unknown relationship is that Jane is Mrs. Reed's niece, being the daughter of her husband's only sister. However, their relationship has been estranged due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, as Jane's parents had made a low marriage that was not favored by Mrs. Reed's family." />
    <node id=".  He made a curious&#10;grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his&#10;cue and followed me from the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane?&quot; he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,&#10;which he had shut.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What to do?--where to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To see a sick lady who has sent for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What sick lady?--where does she live?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At Gateshead; in ---shire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for&#10;people to see her that distance?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is his widow, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you" />
    <node id="bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her&#10;last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bless you!--I knew you would come!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Bessie,&quot; said I, after I had kissed her; &quot;and I trust I am not too&#10;late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The&#10;doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she&#10;will finally recover.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Has she mentioned me lately?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,&#10;but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the&#10;house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and&#10;wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,&#10;and then I will go up with you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the" />
    <node id=" said she; &quot;don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are&#10;you Jane Eyre?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such&#10;a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,&#10;daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden&#10;starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's&#10;movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a&#10;fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her&#10;away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever&#10;broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:&#10;but I said she did--I wish she had died!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only&#10;sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning&#10;her when she made her low marriage" />
    <node id=" The speaker is describing the financial difficulties of Mrs. Reed, Jane Eyre's aunt. Mrs. Reed has been supporting her son, John, who has been leading a wild and extravagant lifestyle, getting into debt and jail. She had helped him twice, but he returned to his old habits each time. Recently, John demanded that Mrs. Reed give up all her money to him, which she refused to do. This led to his despair and eventual death, which is said to have been shocking and perhaps even a suicide. The news of John's death and the manner of it brought on a stroke for Mrs. Reed, who was already weak due to the strain of her financial problems and the fear of poverty. Additionally, Robert Leaven, the person speaking with Jane, mentions that his wife had recently given birth to their third child, indicating that he too is dealing with family concerns." />
    <node id="poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She&#10;was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather&#10;better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making&#10;signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,&#10;that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she&#10;made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to&#10;her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means&#10;anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and&#10;advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but&#10;their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,&#10;that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can&#10;get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow&#10;morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I" />
    <node id="; and but an hour before he&#10;died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been&#10;charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally&#10;weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:&#10;John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish&#10;he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more&#10;money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the&#10;servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never&#10;submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income&#10;goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and&#10;always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and&#10;degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him.&quot;&#10;&#10;She was getting much excited.  &quot;I think I had better leave her now,&quot; said&#10;I to Bessie, who stood on the" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and&#10;child are thriving.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And are the family well at the house, Robert?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very&#10;badly at present--in great trouble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope no one is dead,&quot; I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too&#10;looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how does his mother bear it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been&#10;very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and&#10;his death was shocking.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst" />
    <node id=" well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into&#10;jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he&#10;returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the&#10;knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came&#10;down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all&#10;to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his&#10;extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was&#10;dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--&#10;&#10;&quot;Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very&#10;stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of&#10;poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke" />
    <node id=" The stranger who resembles Jane Eyre and has just arrived at the lodge is Mrs. Reed, Jane's aunt. The reason she is unsure of her identity at first is that they have not seen each other in eight years, and Jane's appearance has changed during that time. Additionally, their relationship has been estranged due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, leading to a strained relationship between them." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Who--I?&quot; was her answer.  &quot;Who are you?&quot; looking at me with surprise and&#10;a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  &quot;You are quite a stranger to&#10;me--where is Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is at the lodge, aunt.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aunt,&quot; she repeated.  &quot;Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the&#10;Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are&#10;quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!&quot;&#10;&#10;I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my&#10;identity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet,&quot; said she, &quot;I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I&#10;wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:&#10;besides, in eight years she must be so changed.&quot;  I now gently assured&#10;her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing&#10;that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I&#10;explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield" />
    <node id=" it.  You go to-morrow,&#10;then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; early.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose so, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm&#10;not quite up to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then say it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What must I say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The same, if you like, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like&#10;something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane" />
    <node id=" After realizing that she had traveled a hundred miles to see her aunt, Jane decides to go against Mrs. Reed's daughters' arrogant demands and stay with her aunt during her illness, despite their strained relationship. Jane's behavior shows her sense of duty and compassion, as she chooses to put aside her personal feelings and past hurts to help someone in need. Additionally, Jane's decision to keep her return plans open-ended suggests a willingness to reconcile with her aunt and mend their relationship, despite the challenges it may pose." />
    <node id="5 shillings is the amount of money that Jane has for her journey when she plans to leave for her aunt's place. When Mr. Rochester learns about this, he ensures that Jane has enough to travel by giving her fifty pounds from his pocket-book. Although he owed her only fifteen pounds, he gave her fifty pounds, which was more than what he owed her. However, Jane declined accepting more than what she was due and insisted on taking only fifteen pounds, which was her due wage. Mr. Rochester then scowled at first but soon recalled something and agreed not to give her the extra money, emphasizing that it seemed stingy, dry, and unfriendly to him." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Early to-morrow morning, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I&#10;daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have&#10;you in the world, Jane?&quot; he asked, smiling.&#10;&#10;I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  &quot;Five shillings, sir.&quot;  He&#10;took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as&#10;if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: &quot;Here,&quot;&#10;said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but&#10;fifteen.  I told him I had no change.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages.&quot;&#10;&#10;I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as&#10;if recollecting something, he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Right, right!  Better not give you" />
    <node id=" The young speaker, Jane Eyre, reacts to Mrs. Reed's cold and unchanged attitude with pain and ire. However, she quickly determines to subdue her aunt and be the mistress of the situation despite their strained relationship. This determination shows Jane's strength of character and her desire to overcome past hurts and difficulties. Jane's decision to visit Mrs. Reed, who is ill and living in a different county, also demonstrates her sense of duty and compassion, as she chooses to put aside her personal feelings to help someone in need. Despite the challenges that this visit may pose, Jane remains open to the possibility of reconciliation with her aunt." />
    <node id=" Based on Eliza's perspective, Georgiana is depicted as a vain and absurd individual who spends most of her time lounging around, complaining about the dullness of their house. Eliza expresses her sentiments indirectly, suggesting that she finds her sister to be self-centered and ungrateful for their current situation.&#10;&#10;Eliza's annoyance with Georgiana stems from her belief that her sister takes many things for granted, such as the comfort of their home and the privileges they have despite their reduced circumstances. Eliza values hard work and frugality, while she sees Georgiana as idle and extravagant.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when their mother was on her deathbed, Georgiana refused to visit her out of fear, further solidifying Eliza's negative opinion of her sister's character. Upon seeing their mother's lifeless body, Georgiana breaks into tears, while Eliza remains calm and observes the situation with a sense of detachment.&#10;&#10;In summary, according to Eliza, Georgiana is a vain, self-centered, and fearful individual who lacks the strength and resilience that Eliza believes she herself possesses." />
    <node id=" never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time&#10;in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and&#10;wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an&#10;invitation up to town.  &quot;It would be so much better,&quot; she said, &quot;if she&#10;could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.&quot;  I&#10;did not ask what she meant by &quot;all being over,&quot; but I suppose she&#10;referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of&#10;funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's&#10;indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had&#10;been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and&#10;unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never" />
    <node id=" fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power&#10;over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised&#10;to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-&#10;sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana&#10;ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the&#10;last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than&#10;any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and&#10;exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or&#10;bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.&#10;&#10;&quot;How is Mrs. Reed?&quot; I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who&#10;thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected&#10;liberty.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you&#10;can see her to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though&#10;I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and&#10;colourless visage.&#10;&#10;The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I&#10;remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a&#10;full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular&#10;features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of&#10;her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her&#10;sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the&#10;other's looked puritanical.&#10;&#10;In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;&#10;the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the&#10;blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and&#10;chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable&#10;hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.&#10;&#10;Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me" />
    <node id=" a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in&#10;fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that&#10;to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The&#10;other drawings pleased her much, but she called that &quot;an ugly man.&quot; They&#10;both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;&#10;and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her&#10;album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at&#10;once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we&#10;had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she&#10;had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent&#10;in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the&#10;attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.

Feeling without judgment is a washy&#10;draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and&#10;husky a morsel for human deglutition.&#10;&#10;It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa&#10;over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day&#10;service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul," />

Eliza and I went to look&#10;at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared&#10;not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,&#10;rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow&#10;and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange&#10;and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and&#10;pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or&#10;subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_&#10;loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a&#10;form.&#10;&#10;Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she&#10;observed--&#10;&#10;&quot;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life&#10;was shortened by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester left his game and followed the narrator, Jane Eyre, after being addressed in a seemingly derogatory manner by Miss Ingram because Jane needed to discuss something important with him. Despite the rudeness of being referred to as &quot;that person&quot; by Miss Ingram and feeling embarrassed by her haughty look, Mr. Rochester prioritized his conversation with Jane. This action suggests that Mr. Rochester values his relationship with Jane and is willing to attend to her needs, even if it means interrupting a social activity and possibly causing some tension with Miss Ingram, who clearly has romantic interests in him." />

It required some courage to&#10;disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not&#10;defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.&#10;She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to&#10;demand, &quot;What can the creeping creature want now?&quot; and when I said, in a&#10;low voice, &quot;Mr. Rochester,&quot; she made a movement as if tempted to order me&#10;away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and&#10;very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure&#10;scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,&#10;and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty&#10;lineaments.&#10;&#10;&quot;Does that person want you?&quot; she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.&#10;Rochester turned to see who the &quot;person&quot; was.  He made a curious&#10;grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his&#10;cue and followed me from the room" />

Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:&#10;but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; and I will do it now;&quot; and having directed him to the servants'&#10;hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions&#10;of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the&#10;stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:&#10;she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-&#10;room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded&#10;thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their&#10;admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to&#10;disturb so interesting a party; my err" />

    <node id=" According to Eliza's perspective, Georgiana is depicted as a vain and absurd individual who spends most of her time lounging around and complaining about the dullness of their house. Eliza sees her sister as self-centered and ungrateful for their current situation, as she takes many things for granted, such as the comfort of their home and the privileges they have despite their reduced circumstances.&#10;&#10;Eliza values hard work and frugality, while she sees Georgiana as idle and extravagant. This contrast in characters is further exemplified when their mother was on her deathbed, where Georgiana refused to visit her out of fear, whereas Eliza remained calm and observed the situation with a sense of detachment. Overall, Eliza regards Georgiana as a vain, self-centered, and fearful individual who lacks the strength and resilience that Eliza believes she herself possesses.&#10;&#10;Regarding Georgiana's indolence and complaints, Eliza generally takes no notice of her sister's behavior. However, one day, Eliza suddenly took up her sister on her indolence and complaints, expressing her annoyance indirectly while maintaining her composure. Despite their different reactions to the situation, both sisters reveal a lack of feeling and judgment in their characters, with Eliza being overly critical and Georgiana being excessively self-centered." />
    <node id="Mr. John's death occurred a week ago in his chambers in London. The speaker mentions that his life had been wild for the past three years, with him engaging in &quot;strange ways&quot; and ultimately having a shocking death. While specific details of his death are not provided, it is implied to be related to his reckless lifestyle, and there is a suggestion that he may have committed suicide due to his despair over financial troubles and his mother's refusal to give him all her money.&#10;&#10;Mr. John's wild and extravagant habits led to significant financial difficulties for Mrs. Reed (Missis), who had been helping him despite already being in a weakened state due to the strain of poverty concerns. The sudden news of his death and its manner severely impacted Mrs. Reed, causing her to suffer a stroke and remain without speech for three days.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. John's reckless lifestyle and financial troubles contributed to Mrs. Reed's poor health before she suffered a stroke, as the stress from supporting him and fearing poverty had already taken its toll on her wellbeing. The shock of his death and learning about its manner further worsened her condition, leading to the stroke." />
    <node id="1. The first person the narrator, Jane Eyre, encounters is her aunt, Mrs. Reed. Jane remembers Mrs. Reed as a significant figure in her life, but they have not seen each other in eight years. Consequently, Jane does not initially recognize her due to changes in her appearance and their strained relationship.&#10;2. The second person Jane encounters is Mr. Rochester, who appears differently than Jane had previously known him. Specifically, he interrupts his social activity and prioritizes Jane's need for a conversation, which demonstrates his value for their relationship and willingness to attend to her needs despite potential tension with Miss Ingram.&#10;&#10;These encounters highlight the passage of time, changes in relationships, and character development for both Mrs. Reed and Mr. Rochester. Additionally, these interactions reveal Jane's determination, strength, and compassion as she navigates challenging situations." />
    <node id=" After her encounter with Mr. Rochester, Jane has informed him about her need for a leave of absence to visit her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who is ill and has sent for her. She mentions that Mrs. Reed lives in Gateshead, --shire, which is about a hundred miles away. Upon learning this, Mr" />
    <node id=" Eliza and Georgiana react differently to meeting &quot;Miss Eyre,&quot; with Eliza greeting her briefly and abruptly without a smile, and then ignoring her, while Georgiana offers more commonplace pleasantries along with side-glances that measure Jane from head to toe. These behaviors suggest that Eliza has formed a negative first impression of Jane, finding her to be unremarkable or not worth her time, and perhaps judging her based on appearance. In contrast, Georgiana's behavior suggests that she is curious about Jane and wants to evaluate her further, possibly due to her status as Mrs. Reed's niece. Both sisters' reactions reveal their lack of warmth and genuine interest in getting to know Jane, highlighting the strained relationship between Jane and the Reed family." />
    <node id="ribable&#10;hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.&#10;&#10;Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by&#10;the name of &quot;Miss Eyre.&quot;  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,&#10;abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her&#10;eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her &quot;How&#10;d'ye do?&quot; several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,&#10;uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances&#10;that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab&#10;merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage&#10;bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they&#10;think you a &quot;quiz&quot; without actually saying the words.  A certain&#10;superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,&#10;express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or" />
    <node id=" The 'fancy head' is actually a portrait of Mr. Rochester, created by the narrator, Jane Eyre. She drew it with great care, paying special attention to the eyes to give them force and spirit. When asked by Eliza if it's a portrait of someone she knows, Jane lies and says it's merely a fancy head. She did this because she wanted to keep her drawing of Mr. Rochester private, as it was not anyone else's business but her own. The creation of this detailed portrait suggests Jane's artistic skills and her growing fascination with Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id=", by no means narrow; then a firm&#10;chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black&#10;whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and&#10;waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,&#10;because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I&#10;shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids&#10;lustrous and large.  &quot;Good! but not quite the thing,&quot; I thought, as I&#10;surveyed the effect: &quot;they want more force and spirit;&quot; and I wrought the&#10;shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy&#10;touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my&#10;gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs&#10;on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed&#10;and content.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;" />
    <node id=" During the visit, Bessie treats Jane Eyre, who is no longer a child but an adult, as if she were still a child. She insists on taking off Jane's bonnet and having her sit by the fireside to be served tea. This behavior is likely due to habit, as Bessie was once in charge of taking care of Jane when she was young.&#10;&#10;Bessie has also retained her &quot;quick temper&quot; from when Jane was a child. While setting out the tea-tray, Bessie occasionally gives little taps or pushes to Robert and Jane, just like she used to do with Jane in the past. The scene of Bessie bustling about, serving tea, and taking care of her own children is reminiscent of old times for Jane, who was once under Bessie's care at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Jane does not object to being treated as a child and passively submits to Bessie's care. This suggests that she still holds some affection for Bessie despite her strict treatment in the past. The relationship between Jane and Bessie, therefore, is marked by a mixture of affection and residual feelings from their time together at Gateshead." />
    <node id=" here an hour, Miss,&#10;and then I will go up with you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and&#10;went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet&#10;and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to&#10;accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling&#10;garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.&#10;&#10;Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting&#10;out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting&#10;a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an&#10;occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.&#10;Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good&#10;looks.&#10;&#10;Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit&#10;still, quite in her old peremptory tones.

    <node id=" It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had&#10;been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on&#10;the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message&#10;that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I&#10;found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's&#10;servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand&#10;was surrounded with a crape band.&#10;&#10;&quot;I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,&quot; he said, rising as I entered;&#10;&quot;but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at&#10;Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give&#10;me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You&#10;are married to Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--" />
    <node id="Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you&#10;can see her to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If,&quot; said I, &quot;you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I&#10;should be much obliged to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  &quot;I&#10;know she had a particular wish to see me,&quot; I added, &quot;and I would not&#10;defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,&quot; remarked Eliza.  I soon&#10;rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would&#10;just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask&#10;her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-&#10;night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,&#10;I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit&#10;always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,&#10;a year ago, have" />
    <node id=" The consequences of having judgment without feeling or feeling without judgment are both detrimental. In the case of Georgiana, her lack of judgment is evident in her inability to see the negative implications of spying on and informing against Lord Edwin Vere out of jealousy and a desire for superiority. Her actions were motivated by feelings of envy and resentment but lacked the wisdom and consideration of the potential consequences, which ultimately ruined his prospects.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Eliza's lack of feeling is illustrated in her indifference to Georgiana's behavior and her cold and abrupt greeting towards Jane. Her overly critical attitude towards her sister's indolence and complaints reveals a lack of empathy and warmth, making it difficult for her to form positive relationships with others.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, their reactions to Lord Edwin Vere's situation suggest that both judgment without feeling and feeling without judgment can lead to negative outcomes. Georgiana's actions, driven by jealousy and envy, resulted in the ruin of his prospects, while Eliza's indifference and lack of warmth prevent her from forming meaningful connections with others.&#10;&#10;Therefore, having a balance of both feeling and judgment is essential for making informed decisions that consider the potential consequences and promote positive relationships with others." />
    <node id="Mr. John's death occurred a week ago in his chambers in London, following three years of wild and extravagant habits that led to significant financial difficulties for his mother, Mrs. Reed (Missis). His lifestyle ruined his health and estate, leading him to jail and eventually his death, which is implied to be related to his reckless behavior. The shock of his death and learning about its manner further worsened Mrs. Reed's condition, causing her to suffer a stroke. Before this incident, she had already been weakened due to the strain of poverty concerns and fear of financial troubles caused by Mr. John's habits." />
    <node id=" Rochester left his game with Miss Ingram and followed Jane Eyre because she needed to discuss something important with him. Despite being addressed derogatorily by Miss Ingram, who had romantic interests in him, Mr. Rochester prioritized his conversation with Jane, suggesting that he values their relationship and is willing to attend to her needs." />
    <node id=" The author, Charlotte Bronte, described Jane Eyre's indifference towards her cousins' behaviors to emphasize the strained relationship between Jane and the Reed family. The negative first impression and lack of warmth from Eliza and Georgiana, as well as Mrs. Reed's past mistreatment of Jane, contribute to this estrangement. Jane's calm and direct interaction with Georgiana regarding Mrs. Reed's health, on the other hand, demonstrates her inner strength and determination, showing that she remains unaffected by any potential tension and prioritizes addressing the situation at hand.&#10;&#10;Bronte aims to contrast Jane's emotional distance from her cousins with her more professional demeanor towards Georgiana, highlighting Jane's growth as a character. This contrast also serves to underscore the animosity between Jane and Mrs. Reed, while still allowing Jane to display compassion by choosing to help her aunt during her illness despite their strained relationship.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this interaction contributes to building suspense around Jane's visit to Mrs. Reed, as the reader is left wondering how the reunion will unfold between these two strong-willed characters with a history of conflict. The author uses this scene to further develop Jane's character and her relationships with others while creating intrigue for what lies ahead in the narrative." />
    <node id=" The speaker is Mrs. Reed, Jane Eyre's aunt. She is unsure of Jane's identity at first because they have not seen each other in eight years, and Jane's appearance has changed during that time. Additionally, their relationship has been estranged due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, leading to a strained relationship between them. Mrs. Reed initially mistakes the narrator for Jane Eyre due to their resemblance and later realizes that the narrator is indeed Jane when she introduces herself." />
    <node id=" The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding as there is no information provided in the narrative that suggests John Eyre, who is Mrs. Reed's son and Jane's cousin, had any past relationship with Jane or refused to help her due to resentment. Instead, the narrative discusses John's financial troubles and his demands for his mother's money, which led to his despair and eventual death. The news of his death and the manner of it brought on a stroke for Mrs. Reed, who was already weak due to the strain of her financial problems and the fear of poverty. Therefore, we cannot answer this question without additional context or information from the narrative." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide a character named Mr. Reed. It appears there may be some confusion in the question regarding the characters in the narrative. The characters related to the Reed family mentioned in the narrative are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Mrs. Reed (Missis): Jane Eyre's aunt, who is the widow of a man named Reed and is the mother of John Eyre and several other children. She sent Jane away to a boarding school after she was left on her care by Jane's parents.&#10;2. John Eyre: Mrs. Reed's only son and Jane's cousin. He had financial troubles due to his wild and extravagant habits, which led him to demand money from his mother. His despair over his financial problems and his mother's refusal to give him all her money may have contributed to his shocking death a week ago in London.&#10;&#10;There is no mention of Mr. Reed having any children who were recognized in society or of Mrs. Reed casting off Jane due to poverty and burden. In fact, the narrative suggests that Mrs. Reed was already wealthy before she received additional financial support from her son, John Eyre. The reason for Mrs. Reed casting off Jane is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that it may have been due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, as Jane's parents had made a low marriage that was not favored by Mrs. Reed's family." />
    <node id=" The speaker occupied themselves by engaging in sketching fancy vignettes using their drawing materials, such as pencils and paper. They did this near the window, apart from Eliza and Georgiana, to keep busy and find amusement during the strained and distant atmosphere." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.&#10;She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade&#10;everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well&#10;as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at&#10;first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and&#10;scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would&#10;chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of&#10;me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or&#10;amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me&#10;for both.&#10;&#10;Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take&#10;a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching&#10;fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to&#10;shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse&#10;of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;&#10;a group" />
    <node id=" no conversation.  I believe&#10;she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing&#10;annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to&#10;vary its clockwork regularity.&#10;&#10;She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than&#10;usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had&#10;been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,&#10;settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had&#10;taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly&#10;improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or&#10;linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a&#10;retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from&#10;disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous&#10;world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, El" />
    <node id=" In the narrative, it is revealed that Mr. Reed, before he died, asked Mrs. Reed to tell Jane Eyre about a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, who wished to adopt Jane and make her his heir. However, Mrs. Reed did not fulfill her promise and instead lied to Jane that her uncle had written to say that Jane was dead. Therefore, your husband (Mr. Rochester) extracted no promise from me (Jane Eyre) regarding his sister's child before he passed away, as this situation is not mentioned in the narrative." />
    <node id="Dear Mrs. Reed,&quot; said I, as I offered her the draught she required,&#10;&quot;think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me&#10;for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have&#10;passed since that day.&quot;&#10;&#10;She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and&#10;drawn breath, she went on thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be&#10;adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was&#10;what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his&#10;disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at&#10;Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose&#10;my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my&#10;torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but&#10;for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it" />
    <node id=" After her encounter with Mr. Rochester, Jane Eyre has informed him about her need to take a leave of absence to visit her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who is ill and has sent for her in Gateshead, --shire, which is about a hundred miles away. Despite being addressed derogatorily by Miss Ingram, Mr. Rochester prioritized his conversation with Jane, suggesting that he values their relationship and is willing to attend to her needs.&#10;&#10;Jane mentions that she will stay for as short a time as possible and promises to return to Thornfield if all is well. She also reveals that Mrs. Reed's coachman has been sent to accompany her on the journey, and Mr. Rochester confirms that he is trustworthy.&#10;&#10;Therefore, after leaving Thornfield Hall, Jane Eyre travels to Gateshead to visit her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who lives there." />
    <node id=" There is no character named Mr. Reed mentioned in the provided narrative. The only members of the Reed family mentioned are Mrs. Reed (Missis), who is Jane Eyre's aunt, John Eyre, who is Mrs. Reed's son and Jane's cousin, and several other children of Mrs. Reed. There is no mention of any past relationship between Jane and John or any reason why the narrator does not have a relationship with his children. The narrative only mentions that John had financial troubles and demanded money from his mother, which led to his despair and eventual death. The news of his death brought on a stroke for Mrs. Reed, who was already weak due to her financial problems and fear of poverty. Therefore, we cannot answer this question without additional information or context." />
    <node id="The very tall and thin young lady with a sallow face, severe mien, and ascetic look, dressed in a straight-skirted black stuff dress, starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and wearing a string of ebony beads and a crucifix is Eliza Reed. She is the sister of Georgiana Reed and the daughter of Mrs. Reed, Jane Eyre's aunt.&#10;&#10;In the provided narrative, Jane Eyre returns to Gateshead Hall after eight years and meets her cousins, Eliza and Georgiana, for the first time since they were children. Jane describes Eliza as having altered past recognition, with little resemblance to her former self. Eliza is dressed in a plain and severe manner, which reflects her ascetic personality.&#10;&#10;Jane's relationship with Eliza and Georgiana is not explicitly mentioned in the narrative. However, it is clear that Jane had previously known them when they were children, as she recognizes their resemblance to their mother, Mrs. Reed. The narrator describes how Eliza has inherited her mother's Cairngorm eye, while Georgiana has her jaw and chin.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Eliza Reed is related to the narrator's past through her family connection as Jane Eyre's cousin and Mrs. Reed's daughter. However, the narrative does not provide further details about their relationship or any specific events involving Eliza in the past." />

Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two&#10;volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third&#10;shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.&#10;The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered&#10;past recognition.&#10;&#10;Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as&#10;Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There&#10;was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme&#10;plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen&#10;collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a&#10;string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though&#10;I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that" />
    <node id="When Bessie, the nursemaid from Jane Eyre's childhood, reunites with the protagonist during their meeting at the Linley house, she insists on treating Jane with hospitality by taking off her bonnet, having her sit by the fireside, and serving her tea. This behavior is likely due to habit, as Bessie was once in charge of taking care of Jane when she was young. Bessie also occasionally gives little taps or pushes to Robert and Jane while setting out the tea-tray, which reminds Jane of their past at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Jane does not object to being treated as a child and passively submits to Bessie's care, suggesting that she still holds some affection for Bessie despite her strict treatment in the past. The relationship between Jane and Bessie is marked by a mixture of affection and residual feelings from their time together at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Therefore, when Bessie reunites with Jane, she shows hospitality and care towards her, reminiscing about their past and treating Jane as if she were still a child under her care." />
    <node id=" The religious rigidity of the woman, who was a rigid formalist, is shown in her unwavering devotion to her religious duties. Despite her severe illness, she adhered to her routine of going to church frequently, even on weekdays. However, when it came to her own sick-room, she neglected her duty to ensure her own wellbeing. The hired nurse, who was supposed to take care of her, would slip out of the room whenever she could, and the patient was left alone and unwatched. This reveals a disconnect between her religious devotion and her responsibility towards her own health and well-being, indicating that her religious rigidity did not extend to all aspects of her life." />
    <node id=" religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice&#10;every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.&#10;&#10;I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who&#10;lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent&#10;attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of&#10;the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own&#10;family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found&#10;the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the&#10;patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the&#10;pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,&#10;re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on&#10;me, and then I moved away to the window.&#10;&#10;The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:&#10;&quot;One lies there,&quot; I thought" />

I yet lingered half-an-hour&#10;longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was&#10;fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve&#10;o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor&#10;were either of her daughters.

She sent Jane away to a boarding school after she was left on her care by Jane's parents.&#10;2. John Eyre: Mrs. Reed's only son and Jane's cousin. He had financial troubles due to his wild and extravagant habits, which led him to demand money from his mother. His despair over his financial problems and his mother's refusal to give him all her money may have contributed to his shocking death a week ago in London.&#10;&#10;There is no mention of Mr. Reed having any children who were recognized in society or of Mrs. Reed casting off Jane due to poverty and burden. In fact, the narrative suggests that Mrs. Reed was already wealthy before she received additional financial support from her son, John Eyre. The reason for Mrs. Reed casting off Jane is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that it may have been due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, as Jane's parents had made a low marriage that was not favored by Mrs. Reed's family.">

There is no mention of any past relationship between Jane and John or any reason why the narrator does not have a relationship with his children. The narrative only mentions that John had financial troubles and demanded money from his mother, which led to his despair and eventual death.

She is the sister of Georgiana Reed and the daughter of Mrs. Reed, Jane Eyre's aunt.&#10;&#10;In the provided narrative, Jane Eyre returns to Gateshead Hall after eight years and meets her cousins, Eliza and Georgiana, for the first time since they were children.

Eliza is dressed in a plain and severe manner, which reflects her ascetic personality.&#10;&#10;Jane's relationship with Eliza and Georgiana is not explicitly mentioned in the narrative. However, it is clear that Jane had previously known them when they were children, as she recognizes their resemblance to their mother, Mrs. Reed. The narrator describes how Eliza has inherited her mother's Cairngorm eye, while Georgiana has her jaw and chin.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Eliza Reed is related to the narrator's past through her family connection as Jane Eyre's cousin and Mrs. Reed's daughter.

She insists on taking off Jane's bonnet and having her sit by the fireside to be served tea. This behavior is likely due to habit, as Bessie was once in charge of taking care of Jane when she was young.&#10;&#10;Bessie has also retained her &quot;quick temper&quot; from when Jane was a child. While setting out the tea-tray, Bessie occasionally gives little taps or pushes to Robert and Jane, just like she used to do with Jane in the past. The scene of Bessie bustling about, serving tea, and taking care of her own children is reminiscent of old times for Jane, who was once under Bessie's care at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Jane does not object to being treated as a child and passively submits to Bessie's care. This suggests that she still holds some affection for Bessie despite her strict treatment in the past. The relationship between Jane and Bessie, therefore, is marked by a mixture of affection and residual feelings from their time together at Gateshead.">

It appears there may be some confusion in the question regarding the characters in the narrative. The characters related to the Reed family mentioned in the narrative are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Mrs. Reed (Missis): Jane Eyre's aunt, who is the widow of a man named Reed and is the mother of John Eyre and several other children. She sent Jane away to a boarding school after she was left on her care by Jane's parents.&#10;2. John Eyre: Mrs. Reed's only son and Jane's cousin. He had financial troubles due to his wild and extravagant habits, which led him to demand money from his mother. His despair over his financial problems and his mother's refusal to give him all her money may have contributed to his shocking death a week ago in London.&#10;&#10;There is no mention of Mr. Reed having any children who were recognized in society or of Mrs. Reed casting off Jane due to poverty and burden. In fact, the narrative suggests that Mrs. Reed was already wealthy before she received additional financial support from her son, John Eyre. The reason for Mrs. Reed casting off Jane is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that it may have been due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, as Jane's parents had made a low marriage that was not favored by Mrs. Reed's family.">

This behavior is likely due to habit, as Bessie was once in charge of taking care of Jane when she was young. Bessie also occasionally gives little taps or pushes to Robert and Jane while setting out the tea-tray, which reminds Jane of their past at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Jane does not object to being treated as a child and passively submits to Bessie's care, suggesting that she still holds some affection for Bessie despite her strict treatment in the past. The relationship between Jane and Bessie is marked by a mixture of affection and residual feelings from their time together at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Therefore, when Bessie reunites with Jane, she shows hospitality and care towards her, reminiscing about their past and treating Jane as if she were still a child under her care.">

She insists on taking off Jane's bonnet and having her sit by the fireside to be served tea. This behavior is likely due to habit, as Bessie was once in charge of taking care of Jane when she was young.&#10;&#10;Bessie has also retained her &quot;quick temper&quot; from when Jane was a child. While setting out the tea-tray, Bessie occasionally gives little taps or pushes to Robert and Jane, just like she used to do with Jane in the past. The scene of Bessie bustling about, serving tea, and taking care of her own children is reminiscent of old times for Jane, who was once under Bessie's care at Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Jane does not object to being treated as a child and passively submits to Bessie's care. This suggests that she still holds some affection for Bessie despite her strict treatment in the past. The relationship between Jane and Bessie, therefore, is marked by a mixture of affection and residual feelings from their time together at Gateshead.">

However, one day, Eliza suddenly took up her sister on her indolence and complaints, expressing her annoyance indirectly while maintaining her composure. Despite their different reactions to the situation, both sisters reveal a lack of feeling and judgment in their characters, with Eliza being overly critical and Georgiana being excessively self-centered.">

    <edge source=" me about Lord&#10;Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a&#10;title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and&#10;so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.&quot;&#10;Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour&#10;afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.&#10;&#10;True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were&#10;two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably&#10;savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy&#10;draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and&#10;husky a morsel for human deglutition.&#10;&#10;It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa&#10;over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day&#10;service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul," target=" The consequences of having judgment without feeling or feeling without judgment are both detrimental. In the case of Georgiana, her lack of judgment is evident in her inability to see the negative implications of spying on and informing against Lord Edwin Vere out of jealousy and a desire for superiority. Her actions were motivated by feelings of envy and resentment but lacked the wisdom and consideration of the potential consequences, which ultimately ruined his prospects.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Eliza's lack of feeling is illustrated in her indifference to Georgiana's behavior and her cold and abrupt greeting towards Jane. Her overly critical attitude towards her sister's indolence and complaints reveals a lack of empathy and warmth, making it difficult for her to form positive relationships with others.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, their reactions to Lord Edwin Vere's situation suggest that both judgment without feeling and feeling without judgment can lead to negative outcomes. Georgiana's actions, driven by jealousy and envy, resulted in the ruin of his prospects, while Eliza's indifference and lack of warmth prevent her from forming meaningful connections with others.&#10;&#10;Therefore, having a balance of both feeling and judgment is essential for making informed decisions that consider the potential consequences and promote positive relationships with others.">

Mrs. Reed (Missis): Jane Eyre's aunt, who is the widow of a man named Reed and is the mother of John Eyre and several other children. She sent Jane away to a boarding school after she was left on her care by Jane's parents.&#10;2. John Eyre: Mrs. Reed's only son and Jane's cousin. He had financial troubles due to his wild and extravagant habits, which led him to demand money from his mother. His despair over his financial problems and his mother's refusal to give him all her money may have contributed to his shocking death a week ago in London.&#10;&#10;There is no mention of Mr. Reed having any children who were recognized in society or of Mrs. Reed casting off Jane due to poverty and burden. In fact, the narrative suggests that Mrs. Reed was already wealthy before she received additional financial support from her son, John Eyre. The reason for Mrs. Reed casting off Jane is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that it may have been due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, as Jane's parents had made a low marriage that was not favored by Mrs. Reed's family.">

Mrs. Reed (Missis): Jane Eyre's aunt, who is the widow of a man named Reed and is the mother of John Eyre and several other children. She sent Jane away to a boarding school after she was left on her care by Jane's parents.&#10;2. John Eyre: Mrs. Reed's only son and Jane's cousin. He had financial troubles due to his wild and extravagant habits, which led him to demand money from his mother. His despair over his financial problems and his mother's refusal to give him all her money may have contributed to his shocking death a week ago in London.&#10;&#10;There is no mention of Mr. Reed having any children who were recognized in society or of Mrs. Reed casting off Jane due to poverty and burden. In fact, the narrative suggests that Mrs. Reed was already wealthy before she received additional financial support from her son, John Eyre. The reason for Mrs. Reed casting off Jane is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that it may have been due to Mrs. Reed's dislike for Jane's mother and her decision to cast Jane off after she was left on her care, as Jane's parents had made a low marriage that was not favored by Mrs. Reed's family.">

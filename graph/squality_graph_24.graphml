    <node id="The Venusian behind the bar, who introduces himself as &quot;Joe,&quot; is very likely the same person as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars. This is suggested by the fact that the bartender Joe has an affinity for Terran cigarettes, which was mentioned as a peculiar habit of Joe the trader. Additionally, Major Polk's mission is to find a man named Joe who knows about Mars and its natives, and there are very few people with that name on Venus. Thus, it is highly probable that the Venusian bartender named Joe is the same person as the famous Joe the trader from Mars." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about Mars, would you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I never left home,&quot; he said simply. &quot;What are you drinking?&quot;&#10; &#10; That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....&#10;  But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.&#10; &#10; &#10; Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most contemptible....&#10; &#10; &quot;What are you drinking, pal?&quot; the Venusian asked again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Skip it,&quot; I said. &quot;How do I get to the captain's shack?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.&quot;&#10; &#10; I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at the bartender.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hello, Joe,&quot; he said. &quot;How's it going?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not so hot, Joe,&quot; the bartender replied.&#10; &#10; I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a great gag. Very funny. Very....&#10; &#10; &quot;You Major Polk, sweetheart" />
    <node id=" somewhere in that jungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a trader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of course, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might really find a guy who was trader Joe.&#10; &#10; I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and besides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his life. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there was I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.&#10; &#10; I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.&#10; &#10; A tall Venusian stepped into the room.&#10; &#10; &quot;Joe?&quot; I asked, just to be sure.&#10; &#10; &quot;Who else, boss?&quot; he answered.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm trying to locate someone,&quot; I said. &quot;I'll need a guide to take me into the jungle. Can you get me one?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It'll cost you, boss,&quot; the Venusian said.&#10; &#10; &quot;How much?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Two cartons of cigarettes at least.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who's the" />

We'll let it go.&quot;&#10; &#10; He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'd meant. Had I tipped him too little?&#10; &#10; I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it looked as hot as hell.&#10; &#10; On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to curse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.&#10; &#10; There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game and a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.&#10; &#10; I walked over and asked, &quot;What are you serving, pal?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Call me Joe,&quot; he answered.&#10; &#10; He caught me off balance. &quot;What?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Joe,&quot; he said again.&#10; &#10; A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.&#10;&quot;You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about Mars, would you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I never left home,&quot;" />
    <node id=" &#10; &quot;Just Joe.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just Joe?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than first names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A relatively simple assignment,&quot; Walsh said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance? Personal habits? Anything?&quot;&#10; &#10; Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. &quot;Well, physically he's like any of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He does have a peculiar habit, though.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's that?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.&quot;&#10; &#10; I sighed. &quot;Well, it's not very much to go on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll find him,&quot; Walsh said, grinning. &quot;I'm sure of it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The trip to Venus came off without a hitch.

A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sir?&quot; the Venusian asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;We're out of cigarettes, Joe,&quot; the Captain said. &quot;Will you get us some, please?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure thing,&quot; the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the door behind him.&#10;  Another Joe , I thought. Another damned Joe.&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;They steal them,&quot; Captain Bransten said abruptly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Steal what?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things they like about Terran culture.&quot;&#10; &#10; So Walsh had taken care of that angle too. He does have a peculiar habit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes. Cigarettes was the tip I should have given; not solars.&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; I said, &quot;suppose we start at the beginning.&quot;&#10; &#10; Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. &quot;Sir?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />

Which brought to mind an important point.&#10; &#10; &quot;I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I thought our activities were confined to Mars.&quot;&#10; &#10; He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk as if he were waiting for me to cut.&#10; &#10; &quot;Mmmm,&quot; he said, &quot;yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so happens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just what's happening on Mars.&quot;&#10; &#10; I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very far.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's had many dealings with the natives there,&quot; Walsh explained. &quot;If anyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.&quot;&#10; &#10; If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give them to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called it &quot;revolt.&quot; It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at least a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.&#10; &#10; &quot;And this man is on" />
    <node id="The Joe you are trying to locate in the jungle on this planet is likely Joe the trader from Mars. You hope that your Venusian guide, named Joe, can help you find this person, who is presumably a fellow native with knowledge of the jungle and its inhabitants.

    <node id=",&quot; the Venusian said.&#10; &#10; &quot;How much?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Two cartons of cigarettes at least.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who's the guide?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;How's the price sound?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fine, fine,&quot; I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were almost a childish people!&#10; &#10; &quot;His name is Joe,&quot; the Venusian told me. &quot;Best damn guide on the planet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do. Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear.

    <node id=" tall, elongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far.&#10; &#10; &quot;I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you familiar with the jungle?&quot; I asked him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Has Joe told you what the payment will be?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.&quot;&#10; &#10; I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled.&#10; &#10; &quot;When can we leave?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Right away, sir. We won't need much really. I've made a list of supplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear light clothing, boots, and a hat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Will I need a weapon?&quot;&#10; &#10; He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. &quot;Why, what for, sir?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind,&quot; I said. &quot;What's your name, by the way?&quot;&#10; &#10; He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was definitely surprised.&#10; &#10; &quot;Joe,&quot; he said. &quot;" />
    <node id="The Venusian who Walsh believes can help explain the reasons for the revolt on Mars is a man named Joe, also known as &quot;Joe the trader.&quot; He is described as having an affinity for Terran cigarettes.

It may be a very original name but I think its popularity here is a little outstanding.&quot;&#10; &#10; Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it was so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and waited for his explanation.&#10; &#10; &quot;I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is there a local hero named Joe?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, no, nothing like that,&quot; he assured me. &quot;It's a simple culture, you know. Not nearly as developed as Mars.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I can see that,&quot; I said bitingly.&#10; &#10; &quot;And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture. Lots of enlisted men, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful ancestry more keenly.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,&quot; Bransten was saying.&#10; &#10; I was beginning to get angry." />
    <node id=" off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on that trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought about Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that revolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started pushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if the whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took over. Swell guy, Walsh.&#10; &#10; Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic I was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like a mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere I looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd never seen before, and some as bare as cactus.&#10; &#10; I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me about. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about him was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have been stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to normal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.&#10; &#10; I wondered if" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, &quot;Just Joe&quot; is a native Venusian who is known to have an affinity for Terran cigarettes. He is described as a relatively simple assignment to locate, likely due to his common name and habit among the natives. Walsh suggests that this individual has knowledge that could be useful in understanding the reasons behind the revolt on Mars, as he has had many dealings with the Martian natives. Major Polk hopes that this Venusian guide named Joe can help him find &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars. It is also mentioned that there are multiple individuals named Joe on Venus, including a bartender and a Venusian working in Captain Bransten's office, but it is unclear whether they are the same person as &quot;Just Joe.&quot;" />
    <node id="The Venusian behind the bar at the Officer's Club is named Joe. Based on his affinity for Terran cigarettes, his common name among the natives, and Major Polk's mission to find a man named Joe who knows about Mars and its natives, it is highly probable that he is the same person as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars. Therefore, Joe the bartender is likely to be knowledgeable about Mars." />
    <node id="The Officer's Club on Venus is a plasteel hut with window shields that serves as a gathering place for off-duty officers. It is located down a heavily overgrown path, and the speaker initially had difficulty gaining entry because he lacked sufficient currency. However, after encountering a Venusian along the way who goes by the name &quot;Joe&quot; and offering him thirty solars, the Venusian leads him to the Officer's Club and allows him entry. This Venusian Joe is likely the same person as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars, known for his affinity for Terran cigarettes and knowledge about Mars and its natives. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he took pity on the speaker's status as a newcomer and allowed him entry despite his lack of currency." />
    <node id=" of keys for it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began wondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking for. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately upon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him anyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a drink first.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where's the Officer's Club?&quot; I asked the Venusian.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you buying information or are you just curious?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Can you take me there?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure thing, Toots.&quot; He picked up my bags and started walking up a heavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when he dropped my bags and said, &quot;There it is.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that protected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable but I really wanted that drink.

Terrible.&quot;&#10; &#10; Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't understand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the game, the fun?&#10; &#10; &quot;You brought the Mars business on yourself,&quot; I told Walsh. &quot;There was never any trouble before you took command.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The natives,&quot; he practically shouted. &quot;They ... they....&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to say about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native. Or maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.&#10; &#10; &quot;What about the natives?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Nothing,&quot; Walsh said. &quot;Nothing.&quot; He was silent for a while.&#10; &#10; &quot;A man of my calibre,&quot; he said then, his face grim. &quot;Dealing with savages.&quot; He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe. The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the colonel in puzzlement." />

Additionally, Major Polk encounters a bartender named Joe at a Venusian Officer's Club who also has an affinity for Terran cigarettes, suggesting that this individual may also be &quot;Just Joe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lieutenant Walsh, who outranks Major Polk due to the &quot;fouled-up machinery&quot; in the military organization, recently promoted Joe despite their past history of Polk reporting a safety lapse by Walsh at the Academy. This suggests that there is some tension between the two men and that Walsh may have ulterior motives for sending Polk on this mission.&#10;&#10;Overall, &quot;Just Joe&quot; is depicted as a knowledgeable figure with unique insights into the conflict between Space II and the Martian natives, but his true identity and motives are not fully revealed in the story." />
    <node id="A PLANET NAMED JOE&#10; &#10;&#10; By S. A. LOMBINO&#10; &#10; There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake a ray-gun at.

I'd never been to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It was just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, Major,&quot; he said. &quot;This man is on Venus.&quot;&#10; &#10; At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported him for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium that could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night. He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by reporting him.

    <node id="The guide named Joe that the Venusian mentioned is a native Venusian who is known to be the best guide on the planet. According to the Venusian, Joe has many positive qualities that make him an excellent choice for a jungle expedition. He is described as courageous and fearless, willing to take on any challenge or task given to him. The Venusian also mentions that Joe has extensive knowledge of the jungle and its inhabitants, making him the ideal guide for navigating through the dense vegetation and encountering various species of flora and fauna. Additionally, Joe has a close relationship with the Venusian who is assisting Major Polk, indicating that he is well-connected within the local community. All of these qualities make Joe the best guide on the planet for the planned jungle expedition to find &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, it is likely that something has happened to the Martian natives who were typically eager to greet outsiders with cries of &quot;Cigarettes? Cigarettes?&quot; The fact that they are absent when Major Polk and his guide, Joe, approach the village suggests that there may have been some sort of conflict or incident involving Space II.&#10;&#10;The significance of the ship with the Space II crest is that it confirms Major Polk's suspicions about the connection between Space II and the missing natives. It is possible that the ship is responsible for their disappearance, or that they have been taken aboard against their will. The fact that Joe seems to recognize the ship and does not seem alarmed by its presence suggests that he may have some involvement in the situation, although this is not explicitly stated in the story.&#10;&#10;Overall, the discovery of the Space II ship and the absence of the Martian natives raises many questions about what has happened on Mars and why Joe has led Major Polk to this location. Further investigation would be needed to fully understand the situation." />
    <node id="'d better get started,&quot; Joe said simply.&#10; &#10; I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a brilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same feeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my friends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my own house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe reminded me of that friend.&#10; &#10; &quot;There's a village ahead,&quot; he said, and the grin on his face was large now, his eyes shining.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Something was missing here.

    <node id="The agreed-upon payment for the guide, who is named Joe, is a carton and a half of cigarettes.

And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had I any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low about the whole affair.&#10; &#10; Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each village he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped gossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye to all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.&#10; &#10; His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing that would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind.

Then he'd say, &quot;This way,&quot; and take off into what looked like more impenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly to another village.&#10; &#10; Each village was the same.

He is described as having a common name among the natives and having personal connections with the Martian natives through his dealings as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; on Mars. Major Polk has been tasked with finding this individual on Venus, who may have knowledge that could be useful in understanding the reasons behind the revolt on Mars. The man is likely to be a helpful guide due to his knowledge of the jungle and its inhabitants." />
    <node id="Captain Bransten mentions starting at the beginning because he likely wants to explain the situation with the name &quot;Joe&quot; on Venus from the beginning of their conversation. He also brings up the idea of a local hero named Joe, but quickly clarifies that there is no such thing. Instead, the reason for the prevalence of the name &quot;Joe&quot; among the natives is because of the influence of enlisted Terran men, who are becoming increasingly acquainted with Venusian culture.&#10;&#10;The significance of this &quot;Joe&quot; to the native culture on Venus is that it has become a common name due to the influence of Terran culture. The fact that there are multiple individuals named Joe on Venus suggests that the name has gained popularity among the natives, likely because it is associated with Terran enlisted men who have interacted with them. This also highlights the relatively simple and less developed nature of Venusian culture compared to Mars, as they are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.&#10;&#10;In relation to Terran culture, the name &quot;Joe&quot; holds significance because it has been introduced to Venusian culture through enlisted men who have brought their own names and cultural influences with them. This reflects the impact that Terran culture can have on native cultures, as well as the ways in which cross-cultural interactions can lead to the adoption of new customs and practices.&#10;&#10;In this specific context, the &quot;Joe&quot; that Major Polk is searching for is likely to be a particularly influential figure due to his knowledge of both Venusian and Martian culture, as well as his affinity for Terran cigarettes. By finding this individual, Major Polk hopes to gain insights into the reasons behind the revolt on Mars and potentially find a solution to the conflict between Space II and the native Martians." />
    <node id="1. Problems on Mars since Colonel Leonard Walsh took command: Ever since Colonel Walsh took over as the commander on Mars, there have been issues between Space II and the natives, resulting in an ongoing conflict that has caused trouble for at least six months. The narrator attributes this conflict to Walsh's aggressive approach towards the Martian natives.&#10;2. Unusual smell on Venus: The narrator describes the peculiar smell on Venus as a mixture of old shoe and after-shave, which he found unpleasant and overwhelming." />
    <node id="Colonal Walsh assigned Major Polk the task of searching for a person named Joe on Venus, despite the fact that there were likely many Joes on the planet, because of their personal history and tension between them. The Colonel had a sense of humor and wanted to give Polk a challenging assignment, but his decision was also influenced by his dislike for Polk. Additionally, it is suggested that Walsh may have ulterior motives for sending Polk on this mission, as he recently promoted Joe despite Polk's past report of a safety lapse by Walsh at the Academy." />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information about the nature of the conflict between Walsh and the natives on Mars. However, it is mentioned that there have been issues between Space II and the Martian natives ever since Walsh took command, leading to an ongoing revolt against Space II's presence on Mars.&#10;&#10;When Walsh realizes that Joe, who is present in the room, is also a native Venusian, he reacts strangely by catching his breath sharply and becoming hesitant to speak further about the natives. This reaction suggests that Walsh may have a personal history with Joe or the Martian natives and that there might be some tension or unresolved issues between them. It is possible that Walsh has previously mistreated or misunderstood the Venusian or Martian culture, which could be contributing to the ongoing conflict between Space II and the natives on Mars.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Walsh refers to Joe as &quot;a man of my calibre dealing with savages,&quot; it indicates a lack of respect and understanding for the native culture, which may have contributed to the escalation of the conflict on Mars. Overall, while the story does not provide specific details about the nature of the conflict between Walsh and the natives on Mars, it suggests that there are underlying tensions and misunderstandings that have led to the ongoing revolt against Space II's presence on the planet." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it's possible that something has happened to the Martian natives who were typically eager to greet outsiders. Their absence when Major Polk and his guide, Joe, approach the village suggests that there may have been some sort of conflict or incident involving Space II. The discovery of the Space II ship near the village further supports this theory, as it may be connected to the disappearance of the Martian natives. It's possible that they have been taken aboard the ship against their will, or that the ship is responsible for their disappearance in some other way.&#10;&#10;Joe's knowledge of the situation and his recognition of the Space II ship suggest that he may have some involvement in the incident. However, this is not explicitly stated in the story. Further investigation would be needed to fully understand what has happened on Mars and why Joe led Major Polk to this location." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, &quot;Just Joe&quot; is a native Venusian who is known to have an affinity for Terran cigarettes. He is described as a relatively simple assignment to locate, likely due to his common name and habit among the natives. Walsh suggests that this individual has knowledge that could be useful in understanding the reasons behind the revolt on Mars, as he has had many dealings with the Martian natives. Major Polk hopes that this Venusian guide named Joe can help him find &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars. It is also mentioned that there are multiple individuals named Joe on Venus, including a bartender and a Venusian working in Captain Bransten's office, but it is unclear whether they are the same person as &quot;Just Joe.&quot; Additionally, it appears that cigarettes may be a valuable commodity on Venus and could potentially be used to barter for information or services." />
    <node id="The person who goes by the name Joe is a native Venusian who is known to have an affinity for Terran cigarettes. There is confusion regarding his identity as the trader referred to in Space II because there are multiple individuals named Joe on Venus, including a bartender and a Venusian working in Captain Bransten's office. However, based on the information provided, it is highly probable that this Venusian guide named Joe, also known as &quot;Just Joe,&quot; is the same person as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars, who has had many dealings with the Martian natives and has knowledge that could be useful in understanding the reasons behind the revolt on Mars. Major Polk hopes that this Venusian guide named Joe can help him find &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars. The confusion arises because it is unclear whether the other individuals named Joe are the same person or not." />
    <node id="1. The Venusian named Joe, who works in Captain Bransten's office, is responsible for stealing cigarettes. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes and occasionally steals them, possibly to resell or barter with other Venusians.&#10;2. Walsh's unusual habit related to Terran cigarettes is that he uses them as a way to identify and track down the Venusian named Joe. He knows about Joe's affinity for cigarettes and mentions this fact to Major Polk, implying that it could be used to locate him. This suggests that Walsh may have previously had dealings with Joe or has some knowledge of his habits." />
    <node id="The nickname &quot;Joe&quot; for the Venusian natives was given by the enlisted men, and it's not explicitly stated in the text why this specific name was chosen. However, it is possible that they used the name &quot;Joe&quot; due to its commonness and familiarity in Terran culture, making it easier for them to relate to the Venusians.&#10;&#10;The reason why the Venusian natives adopted this nickname and developed an affinity for Terran cigarettes is not explicitly explained in the text either. It could be speculated that the Venusians, being exposed to Terran culture through their interactions with humans, might have associated the name &quot;Joe&quot; with positive experiences or Terran individuals they had encountered. As for the cigarettes, it's possible that the Venusians found the taste, smell, or social aspect of sharing cigarettes enjoyable, leading them to adopt the practice and associate it with the nickname &quot;Joe.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Failing career and desire for power: It is likely that Walsh is struggling to keep Mars under control and realizes that any more mistakes on his part could mean the end of his career with Space II. By sending the narrator, who is next in command, on a wild goose chase, Walsh may be hoping to get rid of a potential threat to his position. If he were transferred, the narrator would take over as commander, something that Walsh might find difficult to accept.&#10;2. Possible grudge against the narrator: There is also a hint that Walsh may have held a grudge against the narrator for some past incident. The narrator considers this possibility but cannot think of anything specific that he might have done to anger Walsh. Nevertheless, Walsh's aggressive approach towards the Martian natives and his decision to send the narrator on a seemingly impossible mission suggest that there may be personal issues at play.&#10;3. Lack of trust: It is possible that Walsh does not trust the narrator's judgment or ability to handle the situation on Mars. By sending him away, Walsh may be trying to ensure that his own approach to dealing with the conflict is not undermined by the narrator's actions.&#10;4. Fear of exposure: Another possibility is that Walsh is involved in some illegal or unethical activities related to Space II's operations on Mars. By getting rid of the narrator, he may be trying to prevent any potential investigation or discovery of his wrongdoing.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide explicit answers, it seems likely that Walsh's insistence on getting rid of the narrator is motivated by a combination of factors, including his desire for power, personal animosity, lack of trust, and fear of exposure." />
    <node id=" &#10; When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd just have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on a planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the Captain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; I began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of me. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed like a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something that had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I'd be back again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set for me.&#10; &#10; Or maybe he didn't expect me to come back.&#10; &#10; The thought hadn't occurred to me before this, and I began to consider it seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing at the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a few more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with Space II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken place like Space V or Space" />
    <node id=" would mean the end of his career with Space II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken place like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too. But what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in command. If he were transferred, I'd be in charge of Space II, and I could understand how much that would appeal to Walsh.&#10; &#10; I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good points against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A guy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of uranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn't watched, would deliberately do just about anything.&#10; &#10; Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may have been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a gag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in.&#10; &#10; The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall, elongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far.&#10; &#10; &quot;I understand you need a Grade A guide," />
    <node id="Joe's suggested attire of boots and a hat played a significant role in protecting the narrator from the harsh conditions during their jungle exploration. The undergrowth in the jungle was sharp and jagged, which could have caused serious injuries to the narrator's legs if they were not protected by the high boots. Additionally, the strong sun beating down on the narrator's head would have been unbearable without the protection of a hat.&#10;&#10;Joe was an excellent guide on this journey for several reasons. Firstly, he had extensive knowledge of the jungle and its inhabitants, which allowed him to navigate through the dense vegetation and encounter various species of flora and fauna with ease. He was also fearless and willing to take on any challenge or task given to him, making him the ideal guide for a potentially dangerous jungle expedition. Furthermore, Joe had a close relationship with the Venusian who was assisting Major Polk, indicating that he was well-connected within the local community.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Joe's pleasant demeanor and cheerful attitude made him an excellent companion for the narrator during their journey. He enjoyed every moment of the trip and his spirits were always high, which helped to lift the narrator's own depressed state of mind. Despite the harsh conditions of the jungle, Joe remained positive and continued to serve as an excellent guide throughout the expedition." />
    <node id="The name &quot;Joe&quot; holds significance in the context of Venusian culture because it has become popular among the natives due to the influence of Terran enlisted men. This reflects the impact that Terran culture can have on native cultures and the ways in which cross-cultural interactions can lead to the adoption of new customs and practices. Captain Bransten likely wants to explain the beginning of their current situation by discussing the name &quot;Joe&quot; because it highlights the relatively simple and less developed nature of Venusian culture compared to Mars, as well as the increasing influence of Terran culture on Venus. The prevalence of the name &quot;Joe&quot; among the natives suggests that enlisted Terran men have become acquainted with Venusian culture, which may be relevant to understanding the current situation between Space II and the native Martians." />
    <node id="Colonal Walsh assigned Major Polk the task of searching for a person named Joe on Venus, despite their personal history and tension, as a way to give Polk a challenging assignment due to his sense of humor. However, there were likely many Joes on the planet, so this decision was also influenced by Walsh's dislike for Polk and possibly ulterior motives. Recently, Walsh had promoted Joe despite Polk's past report of a safety lapse by Walsh at the Academy. Additionally, the Joe that Polk is looking for is likely to be the same person as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars, who has an affinity for Terran cigarettes and personal connections with the Martian natives through his dealings on Mars. This makes him a valuable resource for understanding the motivations behind the conflict between Space II's presence and the Martian natives' uprising. The fact that this Joe is likely to be found on Venus, as suggested by his common name among the natives and Polk's mission, implies that he may also have knowledge about the jungle and its inhabitants that could make him a helpful guide for Polk." />
    <node id="The Officer's Club on Venus is a plasteel hut with window shields that serves as a gathering place for off-duty officers. It is located down a heavily overgrown path. The speaker initially had difficulty gaining entry because he lacked sufficient currency. However, after encountering a Venusian along the way who goes by the name &quot;Joe&quot; and offering him thirty solars, the Venusian leads him to the Officer's Club and allows him entry.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the speaker came to gain entry to the Officer's Club by encountering Joe and paying him thirty solars to be allowed access." />
    <node id="1. Major Walsh is detaining Colonel Joe (who is likely the Venusian named &quot;Just Joe&quot; that Polk is looking for) with a stun gun because he wants to assert his authority over Major Polk and perhaps settle some personal scores between them. Walsh, who outranks Polk due to a glitch in the military organization, recently promoted Joe despite Polk's past report of a safety lapse by Walsh at the Academy. This suggests that there is some tension between the two men, and Walsh may have ulterior motives for sending Polk on this mission.&#10;2. Walsh reminds Major Polk about his rank (Colonel) to emphasize his superiority and assert his dominance over Polk. By doing so, he is also reminding Polk of the power dynamic between them and possibly hinting at the reasons for their strained relationship. Walsh's decision to send Polk on a challenging mission to find Joe could be interpreted as a form of punishment or a way to undermine Polk's authority, given their history." />
    <node id=" started.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's all right,&quot; Joe said, smiling.&#10; &#10; The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near the nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh standing near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hello, Major,&quot; he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look cheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.&#10; &#10; &quot;Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,&quot; I said, trying to match his joviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.&#10; &#10; Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with happiness.&#10; &#10; &quot;I see you found your man,&quot; Walsh said.&#10; &#10; I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he was getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.&#10; &#10; I faced Walsh again. &quot;Okay, what's it all about, pal?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Colonel,&quot; Walsh corrected me. &quot;You mustn't forget to say Colonel, Major .&quot; He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless finality" />

Very....&#10; &#10; &quot;You Major Polk, sweetheart?&quot; the Venusian who'd just come in asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.&#10; &#10; &quot;You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,&quot; he said. &quot;He's about ready to post you as overdue.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure,&quot; I said wearily. &quot;Will you take my bags, please?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Roger,&quot; he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.&#10; &#10; &quot;So long, Joe,&quot; he said to the bartender.&#10; &#10; &quot;See you, Joe,&quot; the bartender called back.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing a tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did an officer.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have a seat, Major,&quot; he offered.

    <node id="Based on the story, the journey to find what they are looking for is currently in its third or fourth week, as stated by Joe when the protagonist asked how far they were from the Station. According to Joe's perspective, their plan now is to continue searching for &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars by visiting more villages along the way. When the protagonist expressed doubt about finding him, Joe simply replied that they should keep moving forward, indicating his determination and optimism in completing the mission." />

Joe lounged on the matted greenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife gleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled vines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing through them like strips of silk.&#10; &#10; &quot;How far are we from the Station?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Three or four Earth weeks,&quot; he replied.&#10; &#10; I sighed wearily. &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There are more villages,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll never find him.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Possibly,&quot; Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.&#10; &#10; &quot;A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'd better get started,&quot; Joe said simply.&#10; &#10; I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a brilliant contrast" />
    <node id=" &quot;I would never leave it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you ever been to Earth?&quot; I asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Joe replied. &quot;I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good for Venus. And they are fun.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fun?&quot; I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species Leonard Walsh.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he said wholeheartedly. &quot;They joke and they laugh and ... well, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I suppose so,&quot; I admitted.&#10; &#10; Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more, that I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been just my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and employee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere began to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about the people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid tests, the grind, even the Moon run.

Failing career and desire for power: It is likely that Walsh is struggling to keep Mars under control and realizes that any more mistakes on his part could mean the end of his career with Space II. By sending the narrator, who is next in command, on a wild goose chase, Walsh may be hoping to get rid of a potential threat to his position. If he were transferred, the narrator would take over as commander, something that Walsh might find difficult to accept.&#10;2. Possible grudge against the narrator: There is also a hint that Walsh may have held a grudge against the narrator for some past incident. The narrator considers this possibility but cannot think of anything specific that he might have done to anger Walsh. Nevertheless, Walsh's aggressive approach towards the Martian natives and his decision to send the narrator on a seemingly impossible mission suggest that there may be personal issues at play.&#10;3. Lack of trust: It is possible that Walsh does not trust the narrator's judgment or ability to handle the situation on Mars. By sending him away, Walsh may be trying to ensure that his own approach to dealing with the conflict is not undermined by the narrator's actions.&#10;4. Fear of exposure: Another possibility is that Walsh is involved in some illegal or unethical activities related to Space II's operations on Mars. By getting rid of the narrator, he may be trying to prevent any potential investigation or discovery of his wrongdoing.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide explicit answers, it seems likely that Walsh's insistence on getting rid of the narrator is motivated by a combination of factors, including his desire for power, personal animosity, lack of trust, and fear of exposure.">

If he were transferred, the narrator would take over as commander, something that Walsh might find difficult to accept.&#10;2. Possible grudge against the narrator: There is also a hint that Walsh may have held a grudge against the narrator for some past incident. The narrator considers this possibility but cannot think of anything specific that he might have done to anger Walsh. Nevertheless, Walsh's aggressive approach towards the Martian natives and his decision to send the narrator on a seemingly impossible mission suggest that there may be personal issues at play.&#10;3.

Fear of exposure: Another possibility is that Walsh is involved in some illegal or unethical activities related to Space II's operations on Mars. By getting rid of the narrator, he may be trying to prevent any potential investigation or discovery of his wrongdoing.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide explicit answers, it seems likely that Walsh's insistence on getting rid of the narrator is motivated by a combination of factors, including his desire for power, personal animosity, lack of trust, and fear of exposure.">

However, there were likely many Joes on the planet, so this decision was also influenced by Walsh's dislike for Polk and possibly ulterior motives. Recently, Walsh had promoted Joe despite Polk's past report of a safety lapse by Walsh at the Academy. Additionally, the Joe that Polk is looking for is likely to be the same person as &quot;Joe the trader&quot; from Mars, who has an affinity for Terran cigarettes and personal connections with the Martian natives through his dealings on Mars. This makes him a valuable resource for understanding the motivations behind the conflict between Space II's presence and the Martian natives' uprising. The fact that this Joe is likely to be found on Venus, as suggested by his common name among the natives and Polk's mission, implies that he may also have knowledge about the jungle and its inhabitants that could make him a helpful guide for Polk.">

However, this mission is exceptional since the Venusian native in question can provide valuable insights into the situation on Mars, as he has had many dealings with the Martian natives.&#10;&#10;You find it difficult to envision a Venusian understanding Mars, but you recognize that this individual might hold crucial information regarding the motivations behind the conflict on Mars." target="The Venusian individual that Walsh believes can help understand the situation on Mars is a man named Joe, also known as &quot;Joe the trader.&quot; He is described as having an affinity for Terran cigarettes and having had many dealings with the natives of Mars, making him a valuable resource for understanding the motivations behind the conflict between Space II and the Martian natives.

However, it is possible that they used the name &quot;Joe&quot; due to its commonness and familiarity in Terran culture, making it easier for them to relate to the Venusians.&#10;&#10;The reason why the Venusian natives adopted this nickname and developed an affinity for Terran cigarettes is not explicitly explained in the text either. It could be speculated that the Venusians, being exposed to Terran culture through their interactions with humans, might have associated the name &quot;Joe&quot; with positive experiences or Terran individuals they had encountered. As for the cigarettes, it's possible that the Venusians found the taste, smell, or social aspect of sharing cigarettes enjoyable, leading them to adopt the practice and associate it with the nickname &quot;Joe.&quot;">

This reflects the impact that Terran culture can have on native cultures and the ways in which cross-cultural interactions can lead to the adoption of new customs and practices. Captain Bransten likely wants to explain the beginning of their current situation by discussing the name &quot;Joe&quot; because it highlights the relatively simple and less developed nature of Venusian culture compared to Mars, as well as the increasing influence of Terran culture on Venus. The prevalence of the name &quot;Joe&quot; among the natives suggests that enlisted Terran men have become acquainted with Venusian culture, which may be relevant to understanding the current situation between Space II and the native Martians.">

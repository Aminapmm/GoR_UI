    <node id="Based on Mr. Osborne's reaction to the officer's salute and his subsequent behavior, several aspects of his character can be inferred:&#10;&#10;1. Instinctive and selfish hatred: When Mr. Osborne's carriage meets the officer on the street, he instinctively recoils and harbors immediate hatred towards the officer. This suggests that he has a quick temper and is easily provoked by perceived opposition or interference. His hatred appears to be motivated by his own selfish interests, rather than any genuine grievance against the officer.&#10;2. Prideful: Mr. Osborne takes pride in his hatred and the way he handles situations that do not go his way. He sees himself as a man of his word who always has the moral high ground. This excessive pride can blind him to the feelings and perspectives of others, making it difficult for him to empathize or understand their viewpoints.&#10;3. Duty-bound: Despite his harsh treatment of George's friend Dobbin, Mr. Osborne is aware that Dobbin was a close friend of his son and executor of his will. This fact prompts him to listen to what Dobbin has to say about George's financial situation, revealing that he takes certain duties seriously even if he dislikes the person delivering the message.&#10;4. Vanity: The text highlights Mr. Osborne's vanity in relation to his son's burial place. He is uncomfortable with the idea of George being buried among &quot;mere foreigners&quot; and makes a show of providing a sumptuous reward to the Sergeant who accompanied him on his visit to Laeken. This vanity indicates that Mr. Osborne cares deeply about appearances, prestige, and social standing, even in moments as somber as visiting his son's grave.&#10;5. Difficulty with forgiveness: When faced with Dobbin's message from George, Mr. Osborne refuses to consider any form of forgiveness or reconciliation with his late son. This inflexibility demonstrates a character trait that is not conducive to healing relationships and moving past conflicts.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Mr. Osborne's character can be described as proud, selfish, and unforgiving, with a tendency to react instinctively to opposition or perceived slights. His vanity also plays a significant role in shaping his behavior and decision-making." />
    <node id=" us is there can&#10;tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how&#10;selfish our love is? Old Osborne did not speculate much upon the&#10;mingled nature of his feelings, and how his instinct and selfishness&#10;were combating together.  He firmly believed that everything he did was&#10;right, that he ought on all occasions to have his own way--and like the&#10;sting of a wasp or serpent his hatred rushed out armed and poisonous&#10;against anything like opposition.  He was proud of his hatred as of&#10;everything else.  Always to be right, always to trample forward, and&#10;never to doubt, are not these the great qualities with which dullness&#10;takes the lead in the world?&#10;&#10;As after the drive to Waterloo, Mr. Osborne's carriage was nearing the&#10;gates of the city at sunset, they met another open barouche, in which&#10;were a couple of ladies and a gentleman, and by the side of which an&#10;officer was riding.  Osborne gave a start back, and the Sergeant,&#10;seated with him, cast a look of surprise at his neighbour, as he&#10;touched his cap to the officer, who mechanically returned his salute" />

Her life and her reason&#10;almost have been shaken by the blow which has fallen on her.  It is&#10;very doubtful whether she will rally.  There is a chance left for her,&#10;however, and it is about this I came to speak to you.  She will be a&#10;mother soon.  Will you visit the parent's offence upon the child's&#10;head? or will you forgive the child for poor George's sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;Osborne broke out into a rhapsody of self-praise and imprecations;--by&#10;the first, excusing himself to his own conscience for his conduct; by&#10;the second, exaggerating the undutifulness of George. No father in all&#10;England could have behaved more generously to a son, who had rebelled&#10;against him wickedly.  He had died without even so much as confessing&#10;he was wrong.  Let him take the consequences of his undutifulness and&#10;folly.  As for himself, Mr. Osborne, he was a man of his word.  He had&#10;sworn" />

Osborne made no motion to take it, but shouted out once more&#10;and with another curse to his servant to drive on.&#10;&#10;Dobbin laid his hand on the carriage side.  &quot;I will see you, sir,&quot; he&#10;said.  &quot;I have a message for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;From that woman?&quot; said Osborne, fiercely.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; replied the other, &quot;from your son&quot;; at which Osborne fell back&#10;into the corner of his carriage, and Dobbin allowing it to pass on,&#10;rode close behind it, and so through the town until they reached Mr.&#10;Osborne's hotel, and without a word.  There he followed Osborne up to&#10;his apartments.  George had often been in the rooms; they were the&#10;lodgings which the Crawleys had occupied during their stay in Brussels.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pray, have you any commands for me, Captain Dobbin, or," />

He made it before he went into action.  Are you aware how&#10;small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of his widow?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know his widow, sir,&quot; Osborne said.  &quot;Let her go back to her&#10;father.&quot; But the gentleman whom he addressed was determined to remain&#10;in good temper, and went on without heeding the interruption.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know, sir, Mrs. Osborne's condition?

    <node id="-day had been fixed:  but there was enough in&#10;Mr. Osborne's appearance to prevent Mr. Bullock from making any&#10;inquiries, or in any way pressing forward that ceremony. He and the&#10;ladies whispered about it under their voices in the drawing-room&#10;sometimes, whither the father never came.  He remained constantly in&#10;his own study; the whole front part of the house being closed until&#10;some time after the completion of the general mourning.&#10;&#10;About three weeks after the 18th of June, Mr. Osborne's acquaintance,&#10;Sir William Dobbin, called at Mr. Osborne's house in Russell Square,&#10;with a very pale and agitated face, and insisted upon seeing that&#10;gentleman. Ushered into his room, and after a few words, which neither&#10;the speaker nor the host understood, the former produced from an&#10;inclosure a letter sealed with a large red seal. &quot;My son, Major&#10;Dobbin,&quot; the Alderman said, with some hesitation, &quot;despatched me a&#10;letter by an officer of the --th, who arrived in town to-day.

His&#10;burial-place he had already seen.  Indeed, he had driven thither&#10;immediately after his arrival at Brussels.  George's body lay in the&#10;pretty burial-ground of Laeken, near the city; in which place, having&#10;once visited it on a party of pleasure, he had lightly expressed a wish&#10;to have his grave made.  And there the young officer was laid by his&#10;friend, in the unconsecrated corner of the garden, separated by a&#10;little hedge from the temples and towers and plantations of flowers and&#10;shrubs, under which the Roman Catholic dead repose.  It seemed a&#10;humiliation to old Osborne to think that his son, an English gentleman,&#10;a captain in the famous British army, should not be found worthy to lie&#10;in ground where mere foreigners were buried.  Which of us is there can&#10;tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how&#10;selfish our love is? Old Osborne did not" />
    <node id="Miss Crawley's presence in Paris is causing a stir among the French nobility, including the King and the Duchess of Angouleme, because her niece, Rebecca (Becky) Crawley, has made an advantageous marriage to Rawdon Crawley, who is Miss Crawley's nephew. Becky has become a sensation in Parisian society, attracting the attention of the King and the Duke of Angouleme, as well as the jealousy of some nobles like Miladi Bareacres. Miss Crawley's connection to Becky, who is using her aunt's name to gain access to higher social circles, only adds to the stir. The letter from a &quot;great lady&quot; in Paris praising Becky and mentioning Miss Crawley's benevolence towards French nobles during their exile further highlights the aunt's connection to the rising star of Parisian society." />
    <node id="le Miss Crawley, whose house had been open to so many&#10;of the French noblesse during the emigration.  They received the&#10;colonel's wife in their own hotels--&quot;Why,&quot; wrote a great lady to Miss&#10;Crawley, who had bought her lace and trinkets at the Duchess's own&#10;price, and given her many a dinner during the pinching times after the&#10;Revolution--&quot;Why does not our dear Miss come to her nephew and niece,&#10;and her attached friends in Paris? All the world raffoles of the&#10;charming Mistress and her espiegle beauty. Yes, we see in her the&#10;grace, the charm, the wit of our dear friend Miss Crawley! The King&#10;took notice of her yesterday at the Tuileries, and we are all jealous&#10;of the attention which Monsieur pays her.  If you could have seen the&#10;spite of a certain stupid Miladi Bareacres (whose eagle-beak and toque&#10;and feathers may be seen peering over the heads of all assemblies) when&#10;Madame, the Duchess of Angouleme, the august daughter and companion of&#10;kings, desired especially to be presented to Mrs." />
    <node id=" when&#10;Madame, the Duchess of Angouleme, the august daughter and companion of&#10;kings, desired especially to be presented to Mrs. Crawley, as your dear&#10;daughter and protegee, and thanked her in the name of France, for all&#10;your benevolence towards our unfortunates during their exile! She is of&#10;all the societies, of all the balls--of the balls--yes--of the dances,&#10;no; and yet how interesting and pretty this fair creature looks&#10;surrounded by the homage of the men, and so soon to be a mother!  To&#10;hear her speak of you, her protectress, her mother, would bring tears&#10;to the eyes of ogres.  How she loves you! how we all love our&#10;admirable, our respectable Miss Crawley!&quot;&#10;&#10;It is to be feared that this letter of the Parisian great lady did not&#10;by any means advance Mrs. Becky's interest with her admirable, her&#10;respectable, relative.  On the contrary, the fury of the old spinster&#10;was beyond bounds, when she found what was Rebecca's situation, and how&#10;audaciously she had made use of Miss Crawley's name, to get" />

And he spoke in terms of&#10;the strongest indignation of the faithless conduct of the allies&#10;towards this dethroned monarch, who, after giving himself generously up&#10;to their mercy, was consigned to an ignoble and cruel banishment, while&#10;a bigoted Popish rabble was tyrannising over France in his stead.&#10;&#10;This orthodox horror of Romish superstition saved Pitt Crawley in Lady&#10;Southdown's opinion, whilst his admiration for Fox and Napoleon raised&#10;him immeasurably in Miss Crawley's eyes.  Her friendship with that&#10;defunct British statesman was mentioned when we first introduced her in&#10;this history.  A true Whig, Miss Crawley had been in opposition all&#10;through the war, and though, to be sure, the downfall of the Emperor&#10;did not very much agitate the old lady, or his ill-treatment tend to&#10;shorten her life or natural rest, yet Pitt spoke to her heart when he&#10;lauded both her idols; and by that single speech made immense progress&#10;in her favour.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what do you think, my" />
    <node id="but the truth is, Briggs was a woman of no spirit at all, and the&#10;moment her enemy was discomfited, she began to feel compassion in her&#10;favour.&#10;&#10;&quot;How silly I was,&quot; Mrs. Bute thought, and with reason, &quot;ever to hint&#10;that I was coming, as I did, in that foolish letter when we sent Miss&#10;Crawley the guinea-fowls. I ought to have gone without a word to the&#10;poor dear doting old creature, and taken her out of the hands of that&#10;ninny Briggs, and that harpy of a femme de chambre.  Oh! Bute, Bute,&#10;why did you break your collar-bone?&quot;&#10;&#10;Why, indeed?  We have seen how Mrs. Bute, having the game in her hands,&#10;had really played her cards too well. She had ruled over Miss Crawley's&#10;household utterly and completely, to be utterly and completely routed&#10;when a favourable opportunity for rebellion came. She and her&#10;household, however, considered that she had been the victim of horrible&#10;selfishness and treason, and that her sacrifices in Miss Crawley's&#10;behalf had met" />
    <node id=" anguish at the success of the&#10;little upstart Becky, whose poisoned jokes quivered and rankled in&#10;their chaste breasts. But she had all the men on her side.  She fought&#10;the women with indomitable courage, and they could not talk scandal in&#10;any tongue but their own.&#10;&#10;So in fetes, pleasures, and prosperity, the winter of 1815-16 passed&#10;away with Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, who accommodated herself to polite life&#10;as if her ancestors had been people of fashion for centuries past--and&#10;who from her wit, talent, and energy, indeed merited a place of honour&#10;in Vanity Fair.  In the early spring of 1816, Galignani's Journal&#10;contained the following announcement in an interesting corner of the&#10;paper:  &quot;On the 26th of March--the Lady of Lieutenant-Colonel Crawley,&#10;of the Life Guards Green--of a son and heir.&quot;&#10;&#10;This event was copied into the London papers, out of which Miss Briggs&#10;read the statement to Miss Crawley, at breakfast, at Brighton.  The&#10;intelligence, expected as it might have been, caused a crisis in the&#10;affairs of the Crawley family. " />
    <node id="Miss Crawley's nephews and nieces played a significant role in her life as they were unanimous in expressing their love and affection towards her. They often sent her tokens of affection, such as guinea-fowls, cauliflowers, a purse or pincushion, peaches, grapes, and venison. Miss Crawley had a particular fondness for her nephew Pitt Crawley, who shared her admiration for Fox and Napoleon, which further endeared him to her.&#10;&#10;Regarding the upbringing of Sir Pitt's daughters at Queen's Crawley, Sir Pitt himself was not very involved in their upbringing, often spending his time at the public house. He had sworn never to let a governess enter his doors again. However, Mr. Crawley intervened and forced Sir Pitt to send the girls to school by threatening him. This decision ensured that the daughters received an education and were not allowed to run wild." />

And the two daughters of the house of Queen's Crawley&#10;would have been allowed to run utterly wild (for Sir Pitt swore that no&#10;governess should ever enter into his doors again), had not Mr. Crawley,&#10;by threatening the old gentleman, forced the latter to send them to&#10;school.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, as we have said, whatever individual differences there might&#10;be between them all, Miss Crawley's dear nephews and nieces were&#10;unanimous in loving her and sending her tokens of affection.

The spinster's rage rose to its height,&#10;and sending instantly for Pitt, her nephew, and for the Lady Southdown,&#10;from Brunswick Square, she requested an immediate celebration of the&#10;marriage which had been so long pending between the two families.  And&#10;she announced that it was her intention to allow the young couple a&#10;thousand a year during her lifetime, at the expiration of which the&#10;bulk of her property would be settled upon her nephew and her dear&#10;niece, Lady Jane Crawley. Waxy came down to ratify the deeds--Lord&#10;Southdown gave away his sister--she was married by a Bishop, and not by&#10;the Rev. Bartholomew Irons--to the disappointment of the irregular&#10;prelate.&#10;&#10;When they were married, Pitt would have liked to take a hymeneal tour&#10;with his bride, as became people of their condition.  But the affection&#10;of the old lady towards Lady Jane had grown so strong, that she fairly&#10;owned she could not part with her favourite.  Pitt and his wife came" />

The&#10;Southampton coach used to carry these tokens of affection to Miss&#10;Crawley at Brighton:  it used sometimes to convey Mr. Pitt thither too:&#10;for his differences with Sir Pitt caused Mr. Crawley to absent himself&#10;a good deal from home now:  and besides, he had an attraction at&#10;Brighton in the person of the Lady Jane Sheepshanks, whose engagement&#10;to Mr. Crawley has been formerly mentioned in this history. Her&#10;Ladyship and her sisters lived at Brighton with their mamma, the&#10;Countess Southdown, that strong-minded woman so favourably known in&#10;the serious world.&#10;&#10;A few words ought to be said regarding her Ladyship and her noble&#10;family, who are bound by ties of present and future relationship to the&#10;house of Crawley.

    <node id="To the rector's lady, who went off to tend her husband's broken&#10;collar-bone at the Rectory at Queen's Crawley, the spinster's&#10;communications were by no means so gracious.  Mrs. Bute, that brisk,&#10;managing, lively, imperious woman, had committed the most fatal of all&#10;errors with regard to her sister-in-law.  She had not merely oppressed&#10;her and her household--she had bored Miss Crawley; and if poor Miss&#10;Briggs had been a woman of any spirit, she might have been made happy&#10;by the commission which her principal gave her to write a letter to&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley, saying that Miss Crawley's health was greatly&#10;improved since Mrs. Bute had left her, and begging the latter on no&#10;account to put herself to trouble, or quit her family for Miss&#10;Crawley's sake.  This triumph over a lady who had been very haughty and&#10;cruel in her behaviour to Miss Briggs, would have rejoiced most women;&#10;but the truth is, Briggs was a woman of no spirit at all, and the&#10;moment her enemy was discomfited, she began to feel" />
    <node id="Colonel Crawley, after marrying a dancing-girl named Becky Sharp, has faced negative consequences such as being disowned by his aunt, Miss Crawley, and losing her financial support. This occurred even though he had previously been considered as a potential suitor for Miss Crawley's money or for an alliance with wealthy English families. His marriage to Becky has tarnished the family name in the eyes of Miss Crawley, who now regards it as a drag on the family's reputation.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley is refusing to help Colonel Crawley despite his past glorious deeds because she feels betrayed and unappreciated by him. She had previously made sacrifices for his benefit, but her generosity was not reciprocated, which has led to a deep sense of ingratitude. Furthermore, the promotion and recognition received by Colonel Crawley after his actions in the Battle of Waterloo have caused Miss Crawley additional alarm, as she fears that this might lead to Rebecca regaining favor with her. Therefore, she has not only refused to help him but also warned others against doing so, which is evident from her letter to Mrs. Bute Crawley." />

Rawdon's promotion,&#10;and the honourable mention made of his name in the Gazette, filled this&#10;good Christian lady also with alarm.  Would his aunt relent towards him&#10;now that he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and a C.B.? and would that odious&#10;Rebecca once more get into favour? The Rector's wife wrote a sermon for&#10;her husband about the vanity of military glory and the prosperity of&#10;the wicked, which the worthy parson read in his best voice and without&#10;understanding one syllable of it.  He had Pitt Crawley for one of his&#10;auditors--Pitt, who had come with his two half-sisters to church, which&#10;the old Baronet could now by no means be brought to frequent.&#10;&#10;Since the departure of Becky Sharp, that old wretch had given himself&#10;up entirely to his bad courses, to the great scandal of the county and&#10;the mute horror of his son.  The ribbons in Miss Horrocks's cap became&#10;more splendid than ever." />
    <node id=" her; and the gentle Briggs thought&#10;her friend was less cruel to her when kind Lady Jane was by.  Towards&#10;her Ladyship Miss Crawley's manners were charming.  The old spinster&#10;told her a thousand anecdotes about her youth, talking to her in a very&#10;different strain from that in which she had been accustomed to converse&#10;with the godless little Rebecca; for there was that in Lady Jane's&#10;innocence which rendered light talking impertinence before her, and&#10;Miss Crawley was too much of a gentlewoman to offend such purity.  The&#10;young lady herself had never received kindness except from this old&#10;spinster, and her brother and father:  and she repaid Miss Crawley's&#10;engoument by artless sweetness and friendship.&#10;&#10;In the autumn evenings (when Rebecca was flaunting at Paris, the gayest&#10;among the gay conquerors there, and our Amelia, our dear wounded&#10;Amelia, ah! where was she?) Lady Jane would be sitting in Miss&#10;Crawley's drawing-room singing sweetly to her, in the twilight, her&#10;little simple songs and hymns, while the sun was setting and the sea&#10;was roaring on the beach.

    <node id="Mr. Osborne's decision to go abroad might be due to his desire to avoid any contact with Amelia and her situation, as well as to distance himself from the pitying gazes of his acquaintances. The fact that Amelia is expecting George's child could have further aggravated the rift between father and son, making a reconciliation less likely.&#10;&#10;The news of Mr. Osborne going abroad might impact the possibility of Amelia being recognized as a daughter of the family negatively. If Mr. Osborne leaves England to avoid any reminders of his late son and the circumstances surrounding his death, he would likely be even more reluctant to accept Amelia or her child into the family. This decision could further isolate Amelia, making it difficult for her to receive any support from the Osborne family." />

Much&#10;conversation passed too among the acquaintances of the Osborne family,&#10;who knew of the rupture between the son and father caused by the&#10;former's marriage, as to the chance of a reconciliation with the young&#10;widow. There were bets among the gentlemen both about Russell Square&#10;and in the City.&#10;&#10;If the sisters had any anxiety regarding the possible recognition of&#10;Amelia as a daughter of the family, it was increased presently, and&#10;towards the end of the autumn, by their father's announcement that he&#10;was going abroad.

The widow must live on her&#10;slender pittance, or on such aid as Jos could give her.  &quot;I might tell&#10;her, and she would not heed it,&quot; thought Dobbin, sadly: for the poor&#10;girl's thoughts were not here at all since her catastrophe, and,&#10;stupefied under the pressure of her sorrow, good and evil were alike&#10;indifferent to her.&#10;&#10;So, indeed, were even friendship and kindness.

It was he who brought her back to&#10;England and to her mother's house; when Mrs. O'Dowd, receiving a&#10;peremptory summons from her Colonel, had been forced to quit her&#10;patient. To see Dobbin holding the infant, and to hear Amelia's laugh&#10;of triumph as she watched him, would have done any man good who had a&#10;sense of humour.

This child was her being.  Her&#10;existence was a maternal caress.  She enveloped the feeble and&#10;unconscious creature with love and worship.  It was her life which the&#10;baby drank in from her bosom.  Of nights, and when alone, she had&#10;stealthy and intense raptures of motherly love, such as God's&#10;marvellous care has awarded to the female instinct--joys how far&#10;higher and lower than reason--blind beautiful devotions which only&#10;women's hearts know.  It was William Dobbin's task to muse upon these&#10;movements of Amelia's, and to watch her heart; and if his love made him&#10;divine almost all the feelings which agitated it, alas! he could see&#10;with a fatal perspicuity that there was no place there for him.

The cruellest looks could not have wounded him more than&#10;that glance of hopeless kindness.  He bent over the child and mother.&#10;He could not speak for a moment.  And it was only with all his strength&#10;that he could force himself to say a God bless you.  &quot;God bless you,&quot;&#10;said Amelia, and held up her face and kissed him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hush!  Don't wake Georgy!&quot; she added, as William Dobbin went to the&#10;door with heavy steps.

It was Amelia, but how changed&#10;from the fresh and comely girl Osborne knew.  Her face was white and&#10;thin.  Her pretty brown hair was parted under a widow's cap--the poor&#10;child.  Her eyes were fixed, and looking nowhere.  They stared blank in&#10;the face of Osborne, as the carriages crossed each other, but she did&#10;not know him; nor did he recognise her, until looking up, he saw Dobbin&#10;riding by her:  and then he knew who it was.  He hated her.  He did not&#10;know how much until he saw her there.  When her carriage had passed on,&#10;he turned and stared at the Sergeant, with a curse and defiance in his&#10;eye cast at his companion, who could not help looking at him--as much&#10;as to say &quot;How dare you look at me?

He brought, on&#10;one pretext or another, presents to everybody, and almost every day;&#10;and went, with the landlord's little girl, who was rather a favourite&#10;with Amelia, by the name of Major Sugarplums.  It was this little child&#10;who commonly acted as mistress of the ceremonies to introduce him to&#10;Mrs. Osborne.  She laughed one day when Major Sugarplums' cab drove up&#10;to Fulham, and he descended from it, bringing out a wooden horse, a&#10;drum, a trumpet, and other warlike toys, for little Georgy, who was&#10;scarcely six months old, and for whom the articles in question" />

The newspapers carried the lists of casualties from day to day, creating a breathless pause of expectation for families throughout the country.

During the&#10;time of these battles and dangers, old Miss Crawley was living at&#10;Brighton, very moderately moved by the great events that were going on.&#10;The great events rendered the newspapers rather interesting, to be&#10;sure, and Briggs read out the Gazette, in which Rawdon Crawley's&#10;gallantry was mentioned with honour, and his promotion was presently&#10;recorded.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a pity that young man has taken such an irretrievable step in the&#10;world!&quot; his aunt said; &quot;with his rank and distinction he might have&#10;married a brewer's daughter with a quarter of a million--like Miss&#10;Grains; or have looked to ally himself with the best families in&#10;England.

A few&#10;weeks after the famous fight of Waterloo, and after the Gazette had&#10;made known to her the promotion and gallantry of that distinguished&#10;officer, the Dieppe packet brought over to Miss Crawley at Brighton, a&#10;box containing presents, and a dutiful letter, from the Colonel her&#10;nephew.  In the box were a pair of French epaulets, a Cross of the&#10;Legion of Honour, and the hilt of a sword--relics from the field of&#10;battle:  and the letter described with a good deal of humour how the&#10;latter belonged to a commanding officer of the Guard, who having sworn&#10;that &quot;the Guard died, but never surrendered,&quot; was taken prisoner the&#10;next minute by a private soldier, who broke the Frenchman's sword with&#10;the butt of his musket, when Rawdon made himself master of the&#10;shattered weapon.

    <node id="The controversy surrounding the young gentleman's bill for liquor consumption is that James Crawley, while out with his friends at a pot-house, consumed eighteen glasses of gin. When his cousin, Rawdon Crawley, paid the bill and showed it to Mrs. Firkin, she was shocked by the excessive amount of gin consumed. The bill was then passed on to Miss Briggs, who mentioned the incident to her principal, Miss Crawley.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley is particularly upset about this bill because of the type of alcohol consumed and the setting in which it was consumed. She believes that if James had drunk a dozen bottles of claret, a more refined and respectable drink, she could have pardoned him. However, the fact that he chose to consume gin at a boxers' hangout is unacceptable to her. Miss Crawley prides herself on being a Republican in principle and despises anything related to rank or title, but she sees this behavior as disreputable and below James's standing.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when James visits Miss Crawley the next day, he is unaware that this incident has already been reported to her.

This is&#10;Liberty Hall, James, and you can't do Miss Crawley a greater kindness&#10;than to do as you please, and ask for what you will.

Furthermore, Miss Briggs explained how she had met Mr.&#10;Crawley walking with his cousin and long affianced bride the day&#10;before:  and she told how kind and gentle-looking the lady was, and&#10;what a plain, not to say common, dress she had, all" />

This connection offers worldly and spiritual advantages for both families, especially since Miss Crawley has become estranged from her nephew Rawdon Crawley and is unhappy with the greed of Mrs. Bute Crawley.&#10;&#10;The Southampton coach serves as a symbol of the connections between various individuals and families in this narrative, illustrating how they use it to maintain their relationships and further their social and personal interests." />

The novelist, who&#10;knows everything, knows this also.  Be this, however, as it may, Miss&#10;Crawley's gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends, Rawdon&#10;and his lady, who hoped for the best from their aunt's evidently&#10;pacified humour:  and they took care to entertain her with many&#10;delightful letters from Paris, whither, as Rawdon said, they had the&#10;good luck to go in the track of the conquering army.&#10;&#10;To the rector's lady, who went off to tend her husband's broken&#10;collar-bone at the Rectory at Queen's Crawley, the spin" />

    <node id="After the great battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo in Belgium, the city was turned into a vast military hospital for several months. Many wounded soldiers were still recovering there during the autumn. Despite their injuries, these warriors engaged in gambling, gaiety, and love-making, as described in the narrative.&#10;&#10;As the battles' details and casualty lists were published, people in England felt triumph and fear, looking for the names of their loved ones among the fallen. The anxiety and sorrow experienced by families over the course of the previous two decades, with millions of combatants involved in battles and countless innocent hearts far away, can be imagined.&#10;&#10;Specifically regarding Captain George and Amelia, there is no direct mention of Captain George's fate in the given text. However, it is mentioned that many officers were recovering from their wounds in Brussels during the autumn. Additionally, Amelia has taken custody of her son Georgy, who was very young at the time, and is living in England. It can be inferred that Amelia is a widow, but the narrative does not provide explicit information about Captain George's survival or demise.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Rawdon Crawley's gallantry in the battles was mentioned with honor, and his promotion was recorded, indicating that he survived and played a significant role in the conflicts." />

    <node id="The consequence of James improperly smoking in Miss Crawley's house was that he was asked to leave due to the disturbance and pollution caused by the tobacco. This incident, coupled with the controversy surrounding his excessive consumption of gin at a pot-house, led to Miss Crawley forming a negative opinion of him. As a result, James's career as a candidate for his aunt's favor ended, and he was no longer considered the favored candidate.&#10;&#10;Initially, Rawdon Crawley, who had been the first favorite for Miss Crawley's favor, became more communicative and friendly with James. However, after learning about James's behavior, including his excessive drinking and smoking, Miss Crawley's feelings towards him changed. The narrative suggests that neither James nor Rawdon ended up being the favored candidate in the end. Instead, it is implied that someone else might have won Miss Crawley's favor, although the text does not explicitly mention who that person was." />

This decision might be due to his desire to avoid any contact with Amelia and her situation, as well as to distance himself from the pitying gazes of his acquaintances. The fact that Amelia is expecting George's child could have further aggravated the rift between father and son, making a reconciliation less likely.&#10;&#10;Major Osborne gives toys to his grandson, Georgy, as a parting gift before he leaves for his trip abroad. This gesture symbolizes his affection for his grandchild and his desire to provide for him, despite the strained relationship between him and Amelia.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Lady Jane has formed a close relationship with Miss Crawley, who is fond of her due to her pretty and modest demeanor. Miss Crawley enjoys Lady Jane's company and appreciates her natural goodness and softness. Firkin, Miss Crawley's maid, is not jealous of Lady Jane, and the gentle Briggs thinks her friend is less cruel when Lady Jane is present.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley introduces Lady Jane to her companion, Miss Briggs, who is also fond of Lady Jane. Pitt Crawley plays a role in facilitating this relationship by giving Lady Jane a copy of Miss Briggs's poems, which he had seen at Queen's Crawley, dedicted to his father's late wife.&#10;&#10;Lady Southdown, Lady Jane's mother, also has a connection with Miss Crawley. Pitt lays before her the advantages of an intimacy between her family and Miss Crawley, both worldly and spiritual, as Miss Crawley is now alone due to Rawdon's monstrous dissipation and Mrs. Bute Crawley's greedy tyranny.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Crawley values Lady Jane's company and sees her as a positive influence in her life. The rest of Lady Jane's family, including Lady Southdown and Pitt, also have interactions with Miss Crawley and her companions." />
    <node id=" said the old lady. &quot;She is&#10;stupid and pompous, like all your mother's family, whom I never could&#10;endure.  But bring that nice good-natured little Jane as often as ever&#10;you please.&quot; Pitt promised that he would do so.  He did not tell the&#10;Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship,&#10;who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most delightful and&#10;majestic impression on Miss Crawley.&#10;&#10;And so, nothing loth to comfort a sick lady, and perhaps not sorry in&#10;her heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the&#10;Reverend Bartholomew Irons, and the serious toadies who gathered round&#10;the footstool of the pompous Countess, her mamma, Lady Jane became a&#10;pretty constant visitor to Miss Crawley, accompanied her in her drives,&#10;and solaced many of her evenings.  She was so naturally good and soft,&#10;that even Firkin was not jealous of her; and the gentle Briggs thought&#10;her friend was less cruel to her when kind Lady Jane was by.

    <node id="The happy occasion being celebrated in the text is the safe arrival of Amelia's baby and her godfather William Dobbin's role in bringing her back to her mother's house. Dobbin, who has shown devoted care and unwavering loyalty towards Amelia and her family, steps up to support her during her time of need by ensuring the well-being of her child. This act highlights the deep bond between Amelia and her baby, as well as Amelia's gratitude and joy upon seeing her safe and healthy." />
    <node id="Miss Crawley invited Pitt Crawley and his companions to her residence in Brighton to enjoy each other's company and engage in political conversations, as they shared similar political views. Miss Crawley had always been a true Whig and opposed to the war, while Pitt admired Napoleon and criticized the faithless conduct of the allies towards him. This common ground allowed them to connect on a deeper level.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley did not mention anything about the state of her soul during their conversation because she was more interested in political discussions at that time. Additionally, Miss Crawley's spiritual well-being had already been addressed by Lady Southdown, who saw an opportunity for an intimacy between her family and Miss Crawley, both worldly and spiritually, as Miss Crawley was now alone due to Rawdon's dissipation and Mrs. Bute Crawley's greed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the purpose of Miss Crawley inviting Pitt Crawley and his companions to Brighton was to engage in political conversations and strengthen their bond over shared views. She didn't mention her soul during their conversation as it had already been discussed by Lady Southdown, and she preferred talking about politics instead." />
    <node id="1. When Miss Crawley is recovering from an illness, she tends to be &quot;particularly annoying and savage,&quot; exhibiting a more irritable demeanor. This behavior is compared to how wounds tingle most when they are about to heal, indicating that her annoyance may stem from her recovery process.&#10;2. According to the text, women, including Miss Crawley, can bully other women, subjecting them to &quot;shafts of scorn and cruelty&quot; on a daily basis. This is demonstrated through Mrs. Bute Crawley's treatment of Miss Briggs, as she oppresses and bores her sister-in-law, leading to increased sarcasms and meek submission from Miss Briggs. The text suggests that women in such situations often have no choice but to bear the abuse with resignation due to their disposition and social standing.&#10;2. 1. Rebecca (Becky) Crawley, also known as Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, is involved in dictating her husband's lively and amusing letters to his aunt, Miss Crawley. This action is motivated by Becky's aim to please her aunt and improve their relationship with her, especially since their marriage resulted in Colonel Crawley being disowned by his aunt and losing her financial support.&#10;2. When Miss Crawley perceives Rebecca's influence on Rawdon's letters, she understands that her niece is the one dictating them. However, instead of reacting negatively, Miss Crawley views it positively, appreciating the lively and entertaining nature of the letters, which helps improve her mood and soften her attitude towards her nephew and his wife." />
    <node id="; as was proved by the&#10;increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasms upon Miss Briggs, all&#10;which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness, with cowardice,&#10;with a resignation that was half generous and half hypocritical--with&#10;the slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and&#10;station are compelled to show.  Who has not seen how women bully women?&#10;What tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily repeated&#10;shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the&#10;tyrants of their sex?  Poor victims!  But we are starting from our&#10;proposition, which is, that Miss Crawley was always particularly&#10;annoying and savage when she was rallying from illness--as they say&#10;wounds tingle most when they are about to heal.&#10;&#10;While thus approaching, as all hoped, to convalescence, Miss Briggs was&#10;the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid; yet Miss&#10;Crawley's relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman,&#10;and by a number of tokens, presents, and kind affectionate messages,&#10;strove to keep themselves alive in her recollection.&#10;&#10;In the first" />

Pitt and his wife, Lady Southdown, moved in with Miss Crawley, effectively taking over the household and stripping Miss Crawley of authority.&#10;2. Despite initially disliking Lady Southdown, Miss Crawley welcomed her due to her liking for Lady Jane. However, Lady Southdown soon took control, dismissing staff and installing her own people, much to the annoyance of Pitt.&#10;3. As Miss Crawley grew timid, she clung to Lady Jane for support, leading to speculation that Lady Jane may have helped guide her gently in her later years.&#10;4. The relationship between Miss Crawley and Lady Jane positively affected the entire household, softening Miss Crawley's demeanor and creating a more peaceful environment, especially for Briggs, who no longer faced bullying from her friend." />
    <node id="&#10;of the old lady towards Lady Jane had grown so strong, that she fairly&#10;owned she could not part with her favourite.  Pitt and his wife came&#10;therefore and lived with Miss Crawley: and (greatly to the annoyance of&#10;poor Pitt, who conceived himself a most injured character--being&#10;subject to the humours of his aunt on one side, and of his&#10;mother-in-law on the other). Lady Southdown, from her neighbouring&#10;house, reigned over the whole family--Pitt, Lady Jane, Miss Crawley,&#10;Briggs, Bowls, Firkin, and all.  She pitilessly dosed them with her&#10;tracts and her medicine, she dismissed Creamer, she installed Rodgers,&#10;and soon stripped Miss Crawley of even the semblance of authority.  The&#10;poor soul grew so timid that she actually left off bullying Briggs any&#10;more, and clung to her niece, more fond and terrified every day.  Peace&#10;to thee, kind and selfish, vain and generous old heathen!--We shall see&#10;thee no more.  Let us hope that Lady Jane supported her kindly, and led&#10;her with gentle hand out of the busy struggle of Vanity Fair." />
    <node id="Miss Crawley grew fond of Lady Jane during their visit and was pleased with her kind reception. She also welcomed Lady Southdown due to her liking for Lady Jane, although there is no mention of her growing fond of Lady Southdown herself. Before parting, Miss Crawley hoped that Lady Southdown would send Lady Jane to visit her sometimes. No specific arrangements were made between Miss Crawley and Lady Southdown regarding their relationship or the household.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that according to the options provided in the question, none of them accurately reflect the narrative provided. Miss Crawley did not grow fond of Lady Southdown, and Pitt and his wife did not move in with Miss Crawley, take over the household, or strip her of authority. There is also no mention of Lady Southdown taking control, dismissing staff, or installing her own people. Furthermore, there is no indication that Miss Crawley became timid and clung to Lady Jane for support, nor that the relationship between Miss Crawley and Lady Jane created a more peaceful environment in the household." />
    <node id="James's dreadful predicament is caused by his lack of comfort and familiarity in socializing with ladies, particularly those who engage in conversation about subjects he finds unfamiliar or intimidating, such as foreign languages and poetry.

But the thought of Mr. Bowls did not enter his head.

Half of Briggs's time at dinner was&#10;spent in superintending the invalid's comfort, and in cutting up&#10;chicken for her fat spaniel.  James did not talk much, but he made a&#10;point of asking all the ladies to drink wine, and accepted Mr.&#10;Crawley's challenge, and consumed the greater part of a bottle of&#10;champagne which Mr. Bowls was ordered to produce in his honour.  The&#10;ladies having withdrawn, and the two cousins being left together, Pitt,&#10;the ex-diplomatist, he came very communicative and friendly.

However, these measures were in vain as the Duchess was beyond bounds in her fury but didn't realize that she neither understood English nor had received the letter since Madame the Duchess of X--- had only been twenty years in England. She mistook Rebecca's confident attitude and calm demeanor during their next meeting for remorse, thinking that Rebecca would relent. Thus, her efforts to distance herself from Rebecca proved futile due to this misunderstanding." />
    <node id="Miss Crawley's relatives were anxious about her because they felt that she was not making the most of her social opportunities. Miss Crawley, a wealthy and influential woman, had a nephew, Rawdon Crawley, who was gaining distinction in the military during the battles and dangers. However, Rawdon had married a woman deemed unsuitable by Miss Crawley, leading her to lament the missed opportunity to marry him into a more advantageous family or have his children inherit her fortune.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Miss Crawley's relatives were concerned about her spiritual well-being. While she was more interested in political discussions at the time, Lady Southdown had already addressed this matter and saw an opportunity for spiritual intimacy between her family and Miss Crawley due to her current situation.&#10;&#10;In summary, the anxiety of Miss Crawley's relatives stemmed from their concern about her missed social opportunities, Rawdon's questionable marriage, and her spiritual well-being." />

Mrs. Bute felt regret for hinting about her visit to Miss Crawley in the letter because she believed that if she had gone to her sister-in-law without prior announcement, she could have taken Miss Crawley out of the hands of Miss Briggs and her overbearing French maid. She thought that going unannounced would have allowed her to assert her influence over Miss Crawley's household once again, and potentially prevent the chain of events that led to her being 'routed' and removed from her position of power.&#10;2. The consequences of Mrs. Bute's actions in ruling over Miss Crawley's household were that she played her cards too well and was utterly and completely routed when a favorable opportunity for rebellion came. She and her household, however, considered that she had been the victim of horrible selfishness and treason, and that her sacrifices in Miss Crawley's behalf had met with no gratitude. Mrs. Bute's monstrous fault in insulting Miss Briggs and being haughty and parsimonious to Bowls and Firkin left her without a single person left in Miss Crawley's household to give her information of what took place there, leading to her downfall." />
    <node id="James believes that being a gentleman is superior due to &quot;old blood&quot; or noble birth, which he perceives as providing inherent advantages. He supports his argument by referring to observations of animals, such as dogs in a fight or boat races, where those with perceived higher pedigree tend to win. Additionally, he mentions his recent troubles at college and interactions with low-class acquaintances, contrasting them with the refined company of his cousin's social circle.&#10;&#10;Pitt alludes to factors justifying why marrying an Earl's daughter is suitable when he explains his decision by stating, &quot;Besides, I am a Tory,&quot; implying that aligning himself with nobility and tradition is in line with his political principles. Pitt takes a more diplomatic approach to the topic than James, not explicitly endorsing the notion of superiority due to birth but rather focusing on individual freedom and embracing different perspectives as shown by Miss Crawley being a &quot;Republican in principle&quot; despite her wealth and status." />

Besides, I am a Tory, you know.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, as for that,&quot; said Jim, &quot;there's nothing like old blood; no,&#10;dammy, nothing like it.  I'm none of your radicals.

    <node id="Pitt Crawley thought that the treatment of Napoleon after his downfall was faithless and indignant, which he expressed in strong terms. This view of Napoleon aligned with Miss Crawley's political beliefs, as she had always been a true Whig and opposed to the war. Her admiration for Fox and Napoleon already made her partial to Pitt Crawley, but his defense of the Emperor Napoleon during his conversation with Miss Crawley further endeared him to her and increased his favor in her eyes. This shared view on Napoleon's treatment contributed to their connection and engagement in political conversations at their meeting in Brighton." />

When the&#10;Countess Dowager of Southdown fell foul of the Corsican upstart, as the&#10;fashion was in those days, and showed that he was a monster stained&#10;with every conceivable crime, a coward and a tyrant not fit to live,&#10;one whose fall was predicted, &amp;c., Pitt Crawley suddenly took up the&#10;cudgels in favour of the man of Destiny.  He described the First Consul&#10;as he saw him at Paris at the peace of Amiens; when he, Pitt Crawley,&#10;had the gratification of making the acquaintance of the great and good&#10;Mr. Fox, a statesman whom, however much he might differ with him, it&#10;was impossible not to admire fervently--a statesman who had always had&#10;the highest opinion of the Emperor Napoleon.

This included buying an opera-box for entertainment and patronizing activities such as driving four-in-hand and boxing or horse racing, which were signs of a lavish lifestyle.&#10;&#10;2. Club Membership and Gambling: Clement William joined several worldly clubs and began losing large amounts of money through gambling at Wattier's and the Cocoa Tree. This behavior not only showcased his lack of financial responsibility but also contributed to further financial strain by raising funds on post-obits and encumbering the family estate.&#10;&#10;3. Damaged Reputation: Due to these excessive displays of wealth, poor money management, and involvement in disreputable activities, Clement William's name became a subject of groans within the dowager's circle. This significantly damaged his social reputation among high society.&#10;&#10;4. Emily's Response: In contrast to her brother's behavior, Lady Emily, Clement William's sister, took a more serious approach to life. She gained considerable rank in the serious world as an author of delightful tracts and was highly respected for her work. Her accomplishments further highlighted her brother's carefree attitude and reckless actions, causing disappointment for their mother and elevating Emily's status." />

    <edge source="Based on Mr. Osborne's reaction to the officer's salute and his subsequent behavior, several aspects of his character can be inferred:&#10;&#10;1. Instinctive and selfish hatred: When Mr. Osborne's carriage meets the officer on the street, he instinctively recoils and harbors immediate hatred towards the officer. This suggests that he has a quick temper and is easily provoked by perceived opposition or interference. His hatred appears to be motivated by his own selfish interests, rather than any genuine grievance against the officer.&#10;2. Prideful: Mr. Osborne takes pride in his hatred and the way he handles situations that do not go his way. He sees himself as a man of his word who always has the moral high ground. This excessive pride can blind him to the feelings and perspectives of others, making it difficult for him to empathize or understand their viewpoints.&#10;3. Duty-bound: Despite his harsh treatment of George's friend Dobbin, Mr. Osborne is aware that Dobbin was a close friend of his son and executor of his will. This fact prompts him to listen to what Dobbin has to say about George's financial situation, revealing that he takes certain duties seriously even if he dislikes the person delivering the message.&#10;4. Vanity: The text highlights Mr. Osborne's vanity in relation to his son's burial place. He is uncomfortable with the idea of George being buried among &quot;mere foreigners&quot; and makes a show of providing a sumptuous reward to the Sergeant who accompanied him on his visit to Laeken. This vanity indicates that Mr. Osborne cares deeply about appearances, prestige, and social standing, even in moments as somber as visiting his son's grave.&#10;5. Difficulty with forgiveness: When faced with Dobbin's message from George, Mr. Osborne refuses to consider any form of forgiveness or reconciliation with his late son. This inflexibility demonstrates a character trait that is not conducive to healing relationships and moving past conflicts.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Mr. Osborne's character can be described as proud, selfish, and unforgiving, with a tendency to react instinctively to opposition or perceived slights.

This action is motivated by Becky's aim to please her aunt and improve their relationship with her, especially since their marriage resulted in Colonel Crawley being disowned by his aunt and losing her financial support.&#10;2. When Miss Crawley perceives Rebecca's influence on Rawdon's letters, she understands that her niece is the one dictating them. However, instead of reacting negatively, Miss Crawley views it positively, appreciating the lively and entertaining nature of the letters, which helps improve her mood and soften her attitude towards her nephew and his wife.">

Miss Crawley's connection to Becky, who is using her aunt's name to gain access to higher social circles, only adds to the stir.

The Southampton coach also facilitates the delivery of a book of poems by Miss Briggs, which is used strategically by Mr. Crawley to help foster a connection between Lady Jane Sheepshanks and her noble family, the Southdowns.&#10;&#10;The Southdown family, including Clement William, fourth Earl of Southdown, has a vested interest in forming an alliance with Miss Crawley through Lady Jane's engagement to Mr. Crawley. This connection offers worldly and spiritual advantages for both families, especially since Miss Crawley has become estranged from her nephew Rawdon Crawley and is unhappy with the greed of Mrs. Bute Crawley.&#10;&#10;The Southampton coach serves as a symbol of the connections between various individuals and families in this narrative, illustrating how they use it to maintain their relationships and further their social and personal interests.">

Miss Crawley enjoys Lady Jane's company and appreciates her natural goodness and softness. Firkin, Miss Crawley's maid, is not jealous of Lady Jane, and the gentle Briggs thinks her friend is less cruel when Lady Jane is present.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley introduces Lady Jane to her companion, Miss Briggs, who is also fond of Lady Jane. Pitt Crawley plays a role in facilitating this relationship by giving Lady Jane a copy of Miss Briggs's poems, which he had seen at Queen's Crawley, dedicted to his father's late wife.&#10;&#10;Lady Southdown, Lady Jane's mother, also has a connection with Miss Crawley. Pitt lays before her the advantages of an intimacy between her family and Miss Crawley, both worldly and spiritual, as Miss Crawley is now alone due to Rawdon's monstrous dissipation and Mrs. Bute Crawley's greedy tyranny.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Crawley values Lady Jane's company and sees her as a positive influence in her life. The rest of Lady Jane's family, including Lady Southdown and Pitt, also have interactions with Miss Crawley and her companions.">

Club Membership and Gambling: Clement William joined several worldly clubs and began losing large amounts of money through gambling at Wattier's and the Cocoa Tree.

Emily's Response: In contrast to her brother's behavior, Lady Emily, Clement William's sister, took a more serious approach to life. She gained considerable rank in the serious world as an author of delightful tracts and was highly respected for her work.

This behavior is compared to how wounds tingle most when they are about to heal, indicating that her annoyance may stem from her recovery process.&#10;2. According to the text, women, including Miss Crawley, can bully other women, subjecting them to &quot;shafts of scorn and cruelty&quot; on a daily basis. This is demonstrated through Mrs. Bute Crawley's treatment of Miss Briggs, as she oppresses and bores her sister-in-law, leading to increased sarcasms and meek submission from Miss Briggs. The text suggests that women in such situations often have no choice but to bear the abuse with resignation due to their disposition and social standing.&#10;2. 1. Rebecca (Becky) Crawley, also known as Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, is involved in dictating her husband's lively and amusing letters to his aunt, Miss Crawley. This action is motivated by Becky's aim to please her aunt and improve their relationship with her, especially since their marriage resulted in Colonel Crawley being disowned by his aunt and losing her financial support.&#10;2. When Miss Crawley perceives Rebecca's influence on Rawdon's letters, she understands that her niece is the one dictating them. However, instead of reacting negatively, Miss Crawley views it positively, appreciating the lively and entertaining nature of the letters, which helps improve her mood and soften her attitude towards her nephew and his wife." target="; as was proved by the&#10;increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasms upon Miss Briggs, all&#10;which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness, with cowardice,&#10;with a resignation that was half generous and half hypocritical--with&#10;the slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and&#10;station are compelled to show.  Who has not seen how women bully women?&#10;What tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily repeated&#10;shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the&#10;tyrants of their sex?  Poor victims!  But we are starting from our&#10;proposition, which is, that Miss Crawley was always particularly&#10;annoying and savage when she was rallying from illness--as they say&#10;wounds tingle most when they are about to heal.&#10;&#10;While thus approaching, as all hoped, to convalescence, Miss Briggs was&#10;the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid; yet Miss&#10;Crawley's relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman,&#10;and by a number of tokens, presents, and kind affectionate messages,&#10;strove to keep themselves alive in her recollection.&#10;&#10;In the first">

If you do, come down with me to Tom&#10;Corduroy's, in Castle Street Mews, and I'll show you such a bull-terrier&#10;as--Pooh! gammon,&quot; cried James, bursting out laughing at his&#10;own absurdity--&quot;YOU don't care about a dawg or rat; it's all nonsense.&#10;I'm blest if I think you know the difference between a dog and a duck.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; by the way,&quot; Pitt continued with increased blandness, &quot;it was&#10;about blood you were talking, and the personal advantages which people&#10;derive from patrician birth.  Here's the fresh bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Blood's the word,&quot; said James, gulping the ruby fluid down. &quot;Nothing&#10;like blood, sir, in hosses, dawgs, AND men.

    <edge source="Pitt Crawley thought that the treatment of Napoleon after his downfall was faithless and indignant, which he expressed in strong terms. This view of Napoleon aligned with Miss Crawley's political beliefs, as she had always been a true Whig and opposed to the war. Her admiration for Fox and Napoleon already made her partial to Pitt Crawley, but his defense of the Emperor Napoleon during his conversation with Miss Crawley further endeared him to her and increased his favor in her eyes. This shared view on Napoleon's treatment contributed to their connection and engagement in political conversations at their meeting in Brighton." target=" and above all, about doctors,&#10;quacks, and the particular merits of Dr. Podgers, whom she then&#10;patronised.&#10;&#10;During their interview Pitt Crawley made a great stroke, and one which&#10;showed that, had his diplomatic career not been blighted by early&#10;neglect, he might have risen to a high rank in his profession. When the&#10;Countess Dowager of Southdown fell foul of the Corsican upstart, as the&#10;fashion was in those days, and showed that he was a monster stained&#10;with every conceivable crime, a coward and a tyrant not fit to live,&#10;one whose fall was predicted, &amp;c., Pitt Crawley suddenly took up the&#10;cudgels in favour of the man of Destiny.  He described the First Consul&#10;as he saw him at Paris at the peace of Amiens; when he, Pitt Crawley,&#10;had the gratification of making the acquaintance of the great and good&#10;Mr. Fox, a statesman whom, however much he might differ with him, it&#10;was impossible not to admire fervently--a statesman who had always had&#10;the highest opinion of the Emperor Napoleon.

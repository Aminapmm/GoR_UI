    <node id="1. Introduction of a more able and talented budget and the Seren programme: The new budget aims to support more able and talented children to improve their performance, specifically at higher levels (Level 5 and Level 6). The Seren program will be delivered post-16 and its principles will be introduced earlier in children's education, from Year 9 onwards. This is expected to drive improvements in the overall performance of students.&#10;2. Focusing on reading skills, especially for boys: Recognizing that there is a significant gap between Welsh students and their UK counterparts, as well as an evident disparity between girls' and boys' reading scores, efforts will be made to work with southern Ireland, who have consistently done well in this area. The goal is to learn from their success and improve the reading skills of Welsh children, especially boys.&#10;3. Maintaining support for math and science: Although there has been some success and encouragement in math and science, the new budget and Seren program do not aim to shift focus away from these subjects. The goal is to ensure that improvements in other areas, such as reading and supporting more able and talented children, do not come at the expense of success in math and science.&#10;4. Sustainable improvement: A more strategic, longer-term approach will be taken to address underlying challenges in schools, ensuring that any improvements made are sustainable and not just short-term gains achieved through &quot;easy wins.&quot; This approach aims to tackle deeper issues within schools that may cause them to slip back after initial improvements.&#10;5. Supporting minority ethnic learners: A ring-fenced grant of £10 million will be maintained for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children, with a commitment to having a more sophisticated conversation about what is really going on in attainment across minority ethnic groups. This will help best target resources and understand differences within this diverse group." />
    <node id=" That's one of the reasons why we have introduced a more able and talented budget to support that, and our Seren programme, which is delivering fantastic results post-16. That's why we're introducing the principles of Seren earlier into children's careers, bringing it down from year 9 upwards, to be able to drive improvements. So, I think that that's the area that we are particularly keen to work on: making sure that more of our children perform at the OECD average at level 5 and level 6. Clearly, we've got more work to do on reading. We are working with southern Ireland, who have consistently done well with reading scores, to look to see what lessons we can learn to press on with there with reading.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. My final question on this. You recognise it as a priority, particularly for boys. Does that mean that the focus will then drift slightly from maths, where there has been some success; and drift from science, where the encouragement of more people to take GCSE science has reduced the number of high-level passes?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: First, we have to have a system that is capable of doing all of those of things at the" />
    <node id=" those long-term targets of a score around 500 are part of 'Our National Mission', and we have to keep the pressure on to strive. They are testing, but we have to keep the pressure on to strive to reach them. In some cases, I can be quite encouraged. If we look at reading scores for girls, we are almost there, but that just demonstrates what a journey we've got with our boys to address. For me, one of the ways in which we will reach those targets and achieve them is further progress on our more able and talented children. Although we are now performing at an OECD average, I will be the first person to admit that, although we have seen an improvement in the higher level skills of our more able and talented children, we do not perform at an OECD average with regard to those level 6 and level 5 scores.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Even within the UK, really, we are quite far behind.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. So, I think that's where we really need to push on. That's one of the reasons why we have introduced a more able and talented budget to support that, and our Seren programme, which is delivering fantastic results post" />
    <node id=" to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed? And actually, what does sustainable improvement look like? Because, again, one of the issues, sometimes, that happens is, a school goes into a category with Estyn, there's a big push and a big, 'We must do something' and the school comes out, but actually, that improvement is not sustainable. It's the low-hanging fruit; it's the easy wins that have been achieved, but actually, perhaps some of the fundamental challenges underlying in that school haven't been addressed in that process. So, this is about what will sustainable improvement look like in six months, what's it going to look like in 12 months and what's it going to look like in 18 months. So, actually, a more strategic, longer term approach to real change in a school rather than, perhaps, some of the easy-to-fix items that make a school as if it's doing better, but we really haven't tackled some of the underlying problems that make that school vulnerable to slipping back. Does that make sense?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: I've got a couple of supplementaries on—. Sorry?&#10;Speaker: Kirst" />
    <node id=" it has been a personal priority for you as well. In terms of minority ethnic learners, while there are some groups within that category who are achieving, there is underachievement happening here as well, isn't there? It's not consistent across the minority ethnic group. Is that something that you will be focusing upon?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, and that's why we have committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant to local authorities of some £10 million, to support education of our minority ethnic children. But, again, you are right, you are absolutely right, Siân. We need a much more sophisticated conversation about what is really going on in attainment across minority ethnic groups so that we can best target that resource and have a conversation about what the differences are. You are absolutely correct: there is a real mixed picture. If we look at black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals, they perform almost at the national average for all children—not FSM children; the national average for all children. Black Welsh boys don't, but neither do white Welsh boys. So, there is a really complex picture here, and I really welcome a debate about acknowledging the various levels of performance of BAME children, and where" />
    <node id=" and we are going to do it. I'm really proud that there or thereabouts, a few months either way, we've actually kept to the timetable as outlined in the national mission, and that helps build confidence within the sector that we are committed to that programme and we're going to do what we say we're going to do.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And a final question from me: how effective do you think the investment in school standards has been in this Assembly term, as opposed to the approach taken in the last Assembly term, where there was the protection put in place for core school budgets?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think, first of all, it's important that, whilst this additional resource is specifically targeted at school standards, that is only a part of a much wider education budget, a budget that—you know—is incredibly complex. And so it is really challenging to be able to draw straight lines—you know, 'We did this and it's resulted in that'—given that we're looking at the entirety of school funding here. What's been really important is that, if you" />
    <node id=" this and it's resulted in that'—given that we're looking at the entirety of school funding here. What's been really important is that, if you drill down into what that money has been spent on, 50 per cent of it has been directed towards professional learning in one form or another to support our teaching professionals. And that's been really important to me. I've said it time and time again: an education system cannot exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out to work with them and teach them. Therefore, that investment in staff and investment in the professional learning of our staff and support for them I think is making a difference already but, importantly, will continue to make a difference. But I think it is really challenging to be able to say, 'Well, we spent this bit of money and it definitely led to that', because it's such a complex picture. But that money, the way it's been spent, has been driven by evidence. And, again, what we do know from international best practice, what do we know that works in driving up standards, and then how can we align the money that we've got to supporting that? And, as I said, 50 per cent of that money" />
    <node id="1. Coverage: The school categorization system has evolved from being a tool solely for secondary schools to now covering the entire range of schools.&#10;2. Judgment elements: The elements used in making categorization judgments have changed over time. The levels of support and risk involved have also been adjusted based on feedback and changing requirements.&#10;3. Frequency of Estyn inspections: Initially, schools were only inspected once every seven years; however, the system is evolving to one where Estyn will be more regularly present in schools.&#10;4. Further adjustments: While there have been continuous improvements made to the categorization system based on feedback, it is unclear whether there are specific ongoing plans for further adjustments. The speakers focus mainly on how the system has evolved and its current state rather than future changes." />
    <node id=" do categorisation has changed over a period of time. The elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed, and, of course, the Estyn inspection regime is also changing. At the moment, schools are only inspected once every seven years. We're moving to a system where Estyn will be more regularly in schools. So, they are two systems, but they are different and they look at different things. But our categorisation system is how we look for those ways of identifying support for schools.&#10;Speaker: Huw Irranca-Davies AM&#10;Content: And you've made, with feedback over the last few years, adjustments to the way that the categorisation system works. Are you content with where it is now, or do you see more adjustments being made? Have you got things in front of you that you're getting feedback on saying 'Well, we need to tweak this again a little bit'?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, that system has evolved over time. So, when it started, it was just a tool around secondary schools. Now, it covers the breadth of schools. Initially, on coming into office, when I first came in, it was purely driven by data" />
    <node id="Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, you're right: what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need support, or need to be challenged on their practice. But it's important not to confuse them either. So, our primary route to doing this is our school categorisation system. Sometimes, and perhaps this is inevitable—. That system is primarily there as a triage system around identifying where our resource should be spent. So, our school improvement service—it's a risk-based approach, so they can evaluate where they need to put their time, effort and resource. Sometimes, it's used by other people for other things, but that is not its primary purpose; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability, it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available. Estyn—now that is part of that accountability system. That is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do. Both systems, of course, are evolving. So, how we do categorisation has changed over a period of time. The elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed, and, of course," />
    <node id=" been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about. And we have a new multi-agency approach, working with those schools to try and move them more forward. So it's two from each region, a multi-agency panel, working with the school. And that multi-agency panel includes the school itself, the local authority, the regional consortia school improvement staff, Estyn and Welsh Government—as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school. So, for instance, what would normally happen, Estyn would come in, Estyn would make a judgment on the school—requiring special measures or urgent improvement—and Estyn would go away. They'd go away for six months, and then they'd come back in six months, and they'd make another judgment, 'No, still not good enough', and disappear for six months. We're saying—Estyn and the Welsh Government have agreed that's not the best approach; Estyn need to be part of the solution, rather than just coming and making a judgment. The initial feedback from this trial is very, very positive. Actually, we've had local authorities coming to us and saying, 'Can we put more schools in? Rather than just having two" />
    <node id=" regard to changes to performance measures—you're right that change to those does make it, in some cases, more difficult to look at trends over a period of time. But those changes are made for really good reasons. If we change a performance measure, it is done to ensure that it is in the best interests of learners. And I think the best interests of learners always trumps the ease of comparison. I understand that, for researchers and for opposition Members, even for Ministers, it would be simpler to have the same set of measures over a period of time. But if we know that those things are driving behaviours that are unhelpful to children, and not in the best interests of children, then we have to change them, even thought that then does create challenges in different areas. With regard to what do we look at, there are a number of ways that we gain data and look at data in the system: everything from the categorisation system we spoke of earlier, and trends in categorisation; we look at Estyn reports; we continue to look at examination results. But we're trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that give us a whole picture of the education performance, rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that tells you one thing but" />
    <node id="Content: Thanks for that. I think, for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this, there is some good news within that, in that, certainly, those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along, seem to be moving up the categories, although we still do have that—. Well, it's what the system is there to do, it's to identify those schools that do need that additional support. And I like your analogy of a triage system—'You're fit; keep on doing what you're doing and do it well; you need more support, we'll put the support in.' But, can I turn to those schools that are causing significant concern, and how we identify them? The Estyn chief inspector's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough—there's a need to do something urgently about these concerns, particularly in secondary schools. Have we addressed that? Are you content that we've addressed that concern? Was he right?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No, the chief inspector is absolutely right—absolutely right. I've got no beef with that statement at all. In some ways, when" />
    <node id=" to actually make that difference over time.&#10;Speaker: Huw Irranca-Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, does that—. I'd love to go further, but time is against us. Does that deal with the issue of the schools that have been identified in those categories of requiring significant improvement and requiring special measures? Are those the ones that will be identified now, or is that above and beyond that again?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, those are the ones that are primarily at the forefront of our minds, but this way of sharing data better, to step in earlier, is part of our attempt to address what the chief inspector says about stepping in early—not waiting until a school gets into special measures and a formal judgment from Estyn of that, but actually using that intelligence to get support in there earlier. The three elements that that multi-agency approach look at are: what are the fundamentals that need addressing in this school? What is the capacity of the school itself to be able to address those fundamentals? And, what extra support needs to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed? And actually, what does sustainable improvement look like? Because, again, one" />

    <node id=" Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: How useful is PISA for you in helping school improvement? I know that it's not always the thing that you enjoy watching or looking out for. But, genuinely, how useful is it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: It is one of a range of tools that we need to look at. Siân, quite rightly, talked about consistency. PISA is one thing where there is a level of consistency, so it will continue to be, I think, an important part of how we test how our system is doing.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: We know that you are a little bit encouraged, but we are not out of the woods yet. You mentioned this in Plenary when we talked about PISA. How confident are you that we are on track for meeting these targets that were set before your time, or do you think that having those targets is helpful? Is it setting up aspirations that are incapable of being met within a period of time?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, those long-term targets of a score around 500 are part of 'Our National Mission', and we have to keep the pressure on to strive.

So, I don't think there's a question of it losing focus.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got a lot of areas to cover so we are going to have to pick up our pace a bit. The next questions are from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thinking about you as a Minister trying to see what the long-term trends are with regard to raising standards and improving educational attainment, is that difficult, because the performance measures have changed, haven't they? We can't compare like-for-like now, because of the changes that have been made in the way that performance is measured. So, to begin with, is that a challenge, to see whether progress has been made? And secondly, what evidence do you as Minister use to look at the long-term trends?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: The first thing to say, with regard to changes to performance measures—you're right that change to those does make it, in some cases, more difficult to look at trends over a period of" />
    <node id="50 percent of school funding has been directed towards professional learning for teaching staff. This investment has been driven by evidence on international best practices and what works in driving up educational standards. The speaker highlights that it is challenging to directly link the spending of a specific portion of the budget to particular outcomes, given the complexity of the education system. However, they believe that this investment in staff professional development has made a difference already and will continue to do so, as it aligns with what is known to work in improving educational standards." />
    <node id=" driving up standards, and then how can we align the money that we've got to supporting that? And, as I said, 50 per cent of that money has gone directly to simply supporting the professional learning of those who work with our children.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. We're going to talk now a bit about schools causing concern with questions from Huw Irranca-Davies.&#10;Speaker: Huw Irranca-Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. If I can, just first of all, zoom in on the way in which we actually decide which schools need what support. So, one of the interesting questions for us is how do we use the different systems out there. So, we've got the school categorisation system, which we're familiar with. We've also got Estyn inspection reports, then we've got other intelligence, including local intelligence on the ground. How do you decide from that? How is it decided what schools need support, need challenge? How do we do that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, you're right: what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need" />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Janet Finch-Saunders, and also from Dawn Bowden, and I'd like to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, who is substituting for Dawn Bowden. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We'll move on, then, to our evidence session for our inquiry on school improvement and raising standards. I'd like to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Steve Davies, director of education. Thank you both for attending and for your detailed paper in advance of the meeting. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so we'll go straight into questions, if that's okay. If I can just start by asking you: to what extent is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development still involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: First of all, can I thank the committee for their invitation this morning, and their interest in this particular area? As you will be aware, on coming into office, the director and" />
    <node id=" year.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That's what I'm asking you.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: We've signalled that they're only going to be in place for three years. We are carrying out our own review of the impact of those and that's been built in, but I expect the OECD report—because it is an extensive report—to give us feedback on how those things are working now, and some steer, as they did with the last report, as to the direction we would want to go into.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And what I'm also interested in is those performance management measures around schools. Yes, they're about outcomes for children, but actually are about a broader suite of behaviours within that school, so, yes, qualifications and grades are an important part of a performance measure, but actually, I have other expectations of schools, above and beyond simply qualifications. And so, we would want our permanent set of performance measures to look at a wider set of behaviours within a school, and I think because—. Exams are important—of course they are, qualifications are important—but the way in which those schools achieve those results are also important.&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id=" Can I ask about the powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013, to ask you to tell us about the use of those powers either by Welsh Government or by local authorities, and how effective you feel that legislation has been?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, as you'll be aware, local authorities have quite extensive powers of intervention in schools if they feel that is necessary. If I'm honest, I think there's a mixed picture, with some local authorities using those powers not on a regular basis, but obviously demonstrating a willingness to use those powers. There are other local authorities who don't seem to have used them. Since that legislation came into being, there have been a number of reasons, because of course a local authority has to give a reason for using those powers of intervention. They usually focus on standards, but sometimes they focus on a breakdown in governance arrangements, perhaps, or a failure or a breakdown in financial management. So, sometimes the budgetary issues trigger an intervention power. And the types of interventions that have been used have included, in some cases, appointing additional governors to governing bodies, or suspending a school's delegated budget so the local authority takes on, then, financial control of that particular school" />
    <node id="The Welsh government is taking several measures to address schools requiring significant improvement and special measures. A new multi-agency approach has been introduced to identify and support these schools earlier, focusing on three main elements: addressing fundamental issues within the school, evaluating the school's capacity for self-improvement, and providing additional support to the senior management team and governing body.&#10;&#10;This approach also aims to ensure sustainable improvement over time by shifting from short-term fixes to a more strategic, long-term plan. The government is working on developing better data analysis tools, such as monitoring staff sickness rates, to identify potential issues in schools earlier. They are also piloting this new multi-agency approach in two high schools within each local authority that have been identified as causes for concern.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the government is encouraging local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and use their powers effectively. A national evaluation and improvement resource has been established to promote self-evaluation in schools, which has been underdeveloped in the Welsh education system according to various chief inspectors' reports. This resource aims to be practical and usable for schools, as it has been developed in collaboration with the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners." />
    <node id=" schools is a particular, particular challenge. So you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve—more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating, which is very satisfying to me. But we have got more of an issue with secondary schools, and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation. So even though we've identified them as needing that extra help, they are not moving at pace away from that system. So there are two things that we are doing at the moment. The first is, we are, again, looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school—and perhaps Steve will explain later. For instance, staff sickness, and carefully monitoring staff sickness, because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school. And Steve can explain some of this work later. But we're piloting a new approach to those schools that are causing concern. Each local authority has been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about. And we have a new multi-agency approach, working with those schools to try" />
    <node id=" AM&#10;Content: No, the chief inspector is absolutely right—absolutely right. I've got no beef with that statement at all. In some ways, when a school goes into special measures, in a way, that's a failure of the system, because that should have been identified sooner. So I've got no beef, as I said, with the chief inspector saying that.&#10;Speaker: Huw Irranca-Davies AM&#10;Content: So just to ask, bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having, how is it that we don't identify those schools?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That's it—you're quite right. Undoubtedly, what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding, I think, on behalf of local education authorities' and school improvement services' knowledge about their schools. I think knowledge around schools is greatly enhanced by that process. But we are not there yet in terms of necessarily, then, moving those schools more quickly, once they've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement. And secondary schools is a particular, particular challenge. So you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve—more and more" />
    <node id=" encourage—local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and to use those powers. But it's my belief that it is they who are best placed initially to do that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Minister. Can I ask, then, about the national evaluation and improvement resource and how significant a role that will play in the raising of school standards, and how you feel it's evolved since it was first conceived?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, this brings us back to the principle of self-evaluation and something, if we're honest, we've not been very good at. If you look at a number of chief inspectors' reports into the Welsh education system, self-evaluation has always been identified as something that is missing or underdeveloped in our system to date, hence, then, the work to establish not a new approach, but a more robust approach to self-evaluation. We've done that in conjunction, again, with the OECD, middle tier and practitioners. It's really important, throughout the entirety of our reform journey that that's done in co-construction, because we want this resource to be usable in schools. So, it's all very well having" />
    <node id="1. Coverage: The school categorization system has expanded from initially only covering secondary schools to now encompassing the entire range of schools.&#10;2. Judgment elements: The elements used in making categorization judgments have been adjusted over time, with changes made based on feedback and evolving requirements.&#10;3. Frequency of Estyn inspections: The frequency of Estyn inspections has changed, with the initial seven-year inspection interval now evolving into a system where Estyn will be more regularly present in schools.&#10;4. Further adjustments: While continuous improvements have been made based on feedback, there is no explicit mention of specific ongoing plans for further adjustments to the school categorization system. The speakers mainly focus on how the system has evolved and its current state rather than future changes." />
    <node id="1. Comparisons can be misleading: Local education authorities (LEAs) should not rely solely on being above the national average or comparing themselves to neighboring authorities because such comparisons can be misleading. A local authority that is above the national average may still have room for improvement, and complacency could hinder further progress.&#10;2. Encouraging self-reflection: Proper interpretation and use of data challenge LEAs to think critically about their education system's performance. This approach encourages self-reflection and promotes a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses within the local education authority, leading to more informed decision-making.&#10;3. Identifying areas for improvement: When LEAs pay close attention to their data, they are better equipped to identify specific areas where improvements are needed. This focus on granular data can help target resources and support more effectively, ultimately benefiting schools and students within the authority.&#10;4. Avoiding a false sense of security: Presenting data that compares local authorities can create a false sense of security for those above the average or better than their neighbors. By emphasizing appropriate data use, LEAs are discouraged from becoming complacent and prompted to strive for continuous improvement in educational standards.&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation helps LEAs recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority." />
    <node id=" So, we make changes. Yes, it causes challenges, but we're making those changes because we believe that they are in the best interest of children, and that has to trump ease of comparison.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Siân.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Why have you decided to ask the consortia, Estyn and so on not to report on local data or regional level data? How do we then come to conclusions about what is working if it isn't presented on a local authority and regional basis?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think the thing to say about the communications from Welsh Government, Estyn, and the WLGA is it's not about not communicating the data, it's about challenging people on how that data should be used. So, the data is still available, but it's a challenge to them about how to use that data. So, for instance, when we're presenting data that compares local authority to local authority, you could have a local authority that says, 'There we go, I'm above the national average. I don't need to worry about the education in my local authority, because" />
    <node id=" local authority that says, 'There we go, I'm above the national average. I don't need to worry about the education in my local authority, because I'm above the average, or I'm better than my neighbour.' That doesn't necessarily mean that everything is right in your local education authority. Perhaps your children should be doing even better than what you're presented with. So, actually, it's not about hiding data; it's about how you use the data appropriately. And sometimes, how we were presenting data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of their system. So, it's about how you use data, and that's what the communication from Welsh Government and the WLGA and Estyn was about: think very carefully about this data and what it's telling you about your system, and don't be lulled into a false sense of security that you may be doing brilliantly. Or, perhaps, looking at your data, you may think, 'Oh, my goodness me, we're not doing very well at all', but, actually, more careful consideration of that might show that your school's impact on those children is really, really a positive one. So, you've got to use that data" />
    <node id="1. National model for regional working: The current plan is not to conduct a complete review of the document, but to continue ongoing discussions with the Welsh Local Government Association regarding work with local authorities and type of interventions in schools. There were some updates and revisions proposed to the model in 2017-2018, such as including specialist human resources resource and governor support on a regional basis. However, these proposals were rejected by local government. Some local authorities have voluntarily pooled their resources to deliver these services regionally despite the lack of national agreement.&#10;2. Neath Port Talbot's potential withdrawal from ERW: Neath Port Talbot has given notice that they intend to withdraw from ERW (Education Through Regional Working), which is a regional school improvement service. This move has been met with disappointment by Kirsty Williams, the Education Minister. The Welsh Government is currently seeking assurances and plans from Neath Port Talbot on how they intend to support their schools and teachers if they withdraw from ERW, especially considering the critical time for introducing the new curriculum. There are concerns about how Neath Port Talbot would ensure that their schools and students are not disadvantaged without the support from ERW, as a significant amount of education funding is channelled through regional consortia like ERW. The Welsh Government does not intend to intervene directly, but rather seeks clarification on Neath Port Talbot's plans for fulfilling their functions in absence of ERW." />
    <node id=" are they intending to do that? I haven't seen those plans, but if they were to push forward and follow through on the notice, I would want to see them and I suspect Estyn would want to see them also.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay, just last issue on that: you're just waiting to see what Neath Port Talbot do next, then.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, we have written to Neath Port Talbot to ask them to demonstrate to us, if they were to pull out of ERW, how they're going to meet their functions. I have not heard back from them.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Steve, did you want to say something?&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Obviously—[Inaudible.]—that point. We wrote to them last Friday, and we are awaiting their response now.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, that's where we are. Okay. There was the document in 2015—'National model for regional working'. Is that the current document? Are there plans to change or update it, or is that exactly where we stand?&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" can't impose that solution, and we continue to discuss with ERW what is the optimal way, and they continue to discuss with their constituent local authorities about how that should be organised.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Are you concerned that Neath Port Talbot have given notice that they want to withdraw from regional working?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think it's really disappointing that Neath Port Talbot have published that notice. What's important for me is to understand—not for me, it will be important for Estyn. It will be really important for us to understand how Neath Port Talbot intend to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from ERW, especially at what is a very, very critical time. The regional consortia have a key role to play in supporting systems with the introduction of the curriculum. I would want to know from Neath Port Talbot how they are going to do that without being part of that organisation. And, of course, there's the added complexity that so much of our money is channelled through to schools via the regional consortia. So, I would want to understand from Neath Port Talbot how they're going to safeguard" />
    <node id=" channelled through to schools via the regional consortia. So, I would want to understand from Neath Port Talbot how they're going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who are receiving their education in Neath Port Talbot are not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Do you feel that it's your role to intervene in that area and instruct Neath Port Talbot and ERW as to how they should resolve this issue?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said, I would be seeking assurances—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: What does that mean, though, 'seeking assurances'?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, Neath Port Talbot would need to demonstrate to me how they're going to address these issues. If they're not part of ERW and their schools and their children are not going to be in receipt of the support from ERW, as I said, especially at this critical time, how are they intending to do that? I haven't seen those plans, but if they were to push forward and follow through on the notice, I would want to" />
    <node id=" is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised, I'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers. ERW has got particular challenges, and we continue to work with those in ERW to address those, but increasingly, as I said, what we are seeing the regional consortia do is develop a national approach to school improvement services but deliver that on a regional basis so that there is greater consistency in terms of delivery.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Are you happy that, within the ERW area, local authorities employ their own improvement advisers, rather than doing it in the way that the others do?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We have discussed this at length with them. My preference would be for school improvement officers to be employed in the centre, and we continue to have those discussions, but what's really important to understand is that the regional consortia are not a beast of the Government; they are a beast of the local authorities that have worked together to create a school improvement service that meets their needs. So we can't impose that solution, and we continue to discuss with ERW what is the optimal way, and they continue to discuss with their constituent local authorities about how" />
    <node id=" agreement to put that into the national model, have pooled their resources, and those services are being delivered and supported on a regional basis. So, for instance, the Education Achievement Service now provide specialist HR resource, and EAS and Central South provide governor support. So, although we weren't successful in persuading local government to adopt a new national model, local authorities in those areas saw the value of moving that way.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, with that in mind, and perhaps I'll put this to Steve Davies, everything the Minister just said, and also the line in the document— 'The implementation of this model will change over time'— is it time to go back to that document and review it from a procedural point of view?&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: I don't think it's necessarily timely to go back and have a complete review of it. But, certainly, we are in ongoing discussions with the Welsh Local Government Association, both in terms of work with local authorities, and the type of intervention in schools. So, we keep a constant watch as to which areas that we believe we could develop further. We are not currently intending to do a wholesale review of that. As the Minister touched on earlier" />
    <node id="'National model for regional working'. Is that the current document? Are there plans to change or update it, or is that exactly where we stand?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, that is the current model. Some work was undertaken in 2017 and 2018 to look to update that model and revise that model. Some specific recommendations were put forward about additional services that could be organised on a regional basis; primarily, that is a specialist human resources resource. We know that, because of austerity in some local authorities, HR departments have been really stretched. Education HR is a specialist service, it's not generic. It's often a service that—. I see that as part of a school improvement service. Support for governors also has been stretched within individual local authorities. So, a proposal was put forward to include specialist HR and governor support as part of the regional model. That was rejected by local government. Our local authorities did not want to include that in the regional model. However, I must say, having presented that evidence, some of our local authorities, even though there wasn't a national agreement to put that into the national model, have pooled their resources, and those services are being delivered and supported on a regional basis. So, for instance," />
    <node id="1. Mixed performance among regional consortia: Kirsty Williams, the Education Minister, has acknowledged that there are variations in the performance of school improvement services provided by different regional consortia. Some have performed exceptionally well, while others need improvement. She did not express any specific concern regarding ERW's effectiveness compared to the other consortia.&#10;2. Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal from ERW: The Welsh Government is currently seeking clarification on how Neath Port Talbot intends to support its schools and teachers if they withdraw from ERW. There are concerns about the potential disadvantage for Neath Port Talbot's students due to a lack of regional consortium support, as well as challenges in fulfilling educational functions without ERW. No direct intervention is planned by the Welsh Government at this stage.&#10;3. Investment in professional learning: A significant portion (50%) of school funding has been directed towards professional learning for teaching staff, driven by evidence on international best practices and what works in driving up educational standards. While it can be challenging to directly link specific budget allocations to particular outcomes due to the education system's complexity, the speaker believes this investment has made a difference already and will continue to do so.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there are concerns about Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal from ERW and its impact on local schools and students, there is no explicit mention of ERW being less effective than the other consortia due to its different approach. The focus remains on ensuring that school improvement services, whether provided by regional consortia or local authorities, are effective in delivering positive outcomes for children and teachers." />
    <node id=". Initially, they were very separate entities that did things their own way. Increasingly, over recent years, we have seen those consortia working together on a national approach, but delivered on a regional basis. So I think they themselves have evolved over time. But we are constantly looking for optimum delivery from those particular organisations, but as I said, I think it would be absolutely reckless to go back to a situation where school improvement services were being delivered individually on 22 different bases.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. I'm happy to accept that you've changed your opinion there; that's no problem at all. But with regard to the four consortia, and we'll take Education through Regional Working as an example, it does things differently to the other three. Is that a cause for concern, or do you think that's entirely appropriate?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, ERW does things differently, but then so does the Education Achievement Service. EAS is constituted in a different way to the Central South Consortium. What I'm interested in is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised, I'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers. ERW has got particular" />
    <node id=" any education Minister would look to see whether there was an opportunity to change structures. But in the absence of that, Hefin, I have been absolutely convinced whilst doing this job that you need larger units to be able to carry out successful school improvement work, and I think it would be reckless to advocate the system going back to school improvement being organised in 22 different ways.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. Do you think that the work of the four consortia has been consistent and effective?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: The school improvement services?&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: The four consortia.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think, as with individual local education authorities, there are some regional consortia services that have performed really highly—and that's not me saying that, that's Estyn, but gives us assurance around that—and there are others that need to improve. I think the consortia themselves would admit that they, since their establishment, have found new ways of working. Initially, they were very separate entities that did things their own way. Increasingly, over recent years, we have seen those consortia working together on" />
    <node id="1. Recent changes in performance measures for English literature GCSE exams in Wales have had a positive impact on the number of students taking the exam, especially those entitled to free school meals.&#10;2. Previously, a performance measure around English was introduced which led to significant numbers of children, particularly those entitled to free school meals, not sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;3. This performance measure was changed last year, resulting in a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;4. The rationale behind these changes is that studying literature is essential for the development of literacy and oracy standards, introducing children to the joy of reading and the written word. It also helps in reducing the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not." />
    <node id=" it does present more of a challenge, presumably, because you have to look at more indicators, and take evidence from different places. But I take it that you're confident that the trajectory is going in the right way.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, I think we are making improvements. But you're right: it does make it more challenging. But those changes are being made for the right reasons, as I said, whether that be at level 2 plus. Look at English literature. I understand why perhaps a performance measure around English was introduced, but the effect of that was that significant numbers of children—and, it must be said, usually children who are entitled to free school meals—were suddenly not sitting English literature GCSE. We've changed that performance measure, and guess what? Last year, we saw a significant increase in the number of children that were sitting English literature GCSE. For standards of literacy and oracy, I think studying literature is really, really important, before we even get into the joy of introducing children to the written word and the love of reading. So, we make changes. Yes, it causes challenges, but we're making those changes because we believe that they are in the best interest of children, and" />
    <node id=" We don't have to make assumptions about the nature of many, many, many of those children. We have seen a significant increase in the number of children who are having the opportunity to sit GCSE science and who are passing GCSE science. So, I'm not going to make any apologies about that. One of the reasons that I suspect we have ended up with poor science scores is because of the previous policy around science entries and science qualifications. Again, one of the reasons that we have changed it isn't just solely because we need to do better in PISA, but I think that by changing it, we will see an impact on PISA.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you for that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: The final set of questions is from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: I just want to discuss an issue that I know is important to you, namely closing the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not eligible for free school meals. Unfortunately, the problem persists, doesn't it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. We are" />
    <node id=", I think that, as I said, I am not shying away from any assumption or declaration that we need to do better. But, I do think that we need to acknowledge where progress has been made. If we go back to look at what PISA has said about our performance, the PISA results show that pupils in Wales are relatively more able to overcome the disadvantage of their background than is the average in OECD countries. So, our children are doing better in that, and that gives me encouragement. That's not me saying that; that's there. If we look at pupils who are eligible for free school meals, they do score below their better-off counterparts in PISA by some 34 points. The gap in England is 40 points. So, again, that gap is smaller here in Wales. If we look at basic levels of qualifications, back in—. It's difficult to make comparisons because of all the reasons we have talked about, but if we look back to 2006 and we look at the very basic level of qualifications, which is a level 1 qualification, we have seen a jump from 9.4 per cent of children in 2006 achieving a level 1 qualification to over 18 per cent. So, there is progress. There is evidence that the resources" />
    <node id="1. The previous performance measure around English literature GCSE resulted in significant numbers of children, particularly those entitled to free school meals, not sitting for the exam. This led to a narrow focus on certain parts of the cohort and curriculum.&#10;2. The performance measure was changed last year, leading to a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the English literature GCSE. This change is beneficial as studying literature is essential for the development of literacy and oracy standards, introducing children to the joy of reading and the written word. It also helps reduce the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not.&#10;3. The change in performance measures has resulted in the need to consider more indicators and gather evidence from different sources, which can be challenging. However, the Welsh government believes that the best interests of learners should always be the primary concern, even if it makes assessments more complex or difficult to compare over time.&#10;4. The government is developing a broader range of data and statistics to gain a whole picture of the education performance, rather than focusing on a single simple indicator. This approach will provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the education system in Wales." />
    <node id=" national level, the ongoing data. So, if you looked at level 2 plus, we believe it is important that children get five good GCSEs—for higher education and for employment. So, we've not lost sight of those at a national level—we're not using them as a narrow set of performance measures for individual schools.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, if we look at—level 2 plus is a good example. We know that a relentless focus on that single measure, as a way of judging the system, leads to a set of behaviours in schools. It narrows the focus onto a certain part of the cohort, it narrows the curriculum, when we know that children—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: I'm not challenging the fact that you've changed the performance measures—I understand that, and having a broader way of looking is better in the long run. I'm just saying, because there's been this change, it makes it more of a challenge—whilst accepting why you've made the changes, but it does present more of a challenge, presumably, because you have to look at more indicators, and take evidence from different places. But I take it that you" />
    <node id="1. Introduction of a new multi-agency approach: The Welsh government has introduced a multi-agency approach to identify and support schools requiring significant improvement and special measures earlier. This approach focuses on addressing fundamental issues within the school, evaluating the school's capacity for self-improvement, and providing additional support to the senior management team and governing body.&#10;&#10;2. Proactive local authority intervention: The government is encouraging local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and use their powers effectively. This includes developing better data analysis tools, such as monitoring staff sickness rates, to identify potential issues in schools earlier.&#10;&#10;3. Early warning systems: To further identify schools causing concern at an early stage, the government is looking into different sets of data that can serve as early warning systems, including carefully monitoring staff sickness levels. High levels of staff sickness have been found to correlate with issues within a school.&#10;&#10;4. Targeted pilot program: A new pilot has been launched in which local authorities identify two high schools they are particularly worried about. A multi-agency approach is used to work with these schools and provide extra support, aiming to address the persistent challenge of moving individual secondary schools forward at a faster pace.&#10;&#10;5. Improved collaboration: The government has collaborated with organizations like the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners to develop practical and usable self-evaluation resources for schools, promoting self-evaluation in the Welsh education system as it has been underdeveloped according to various chief inspectors' reports." />
    <node id=" extra support, there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it. But you're absolutely right—we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace. And 11 per cent is not acceptable to me, Huw, which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where, persistently, we have concerns about their ability to move forward. If we'd have carried on doing the same thing, I suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result—hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Very briefly, the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools, particularly at GCSEs, with a narrow focus. As was said earlier, some of these are the same groups—they trip in and then they don't come out. Our belief is, from research, that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time, and you can do that by targeting and immersing them. Estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better, but we haven't handled" />
    <node id="1. According to PISA results, students in Wales have shown progress in overcoming the disadvantage of their background compared to the OECD average.&#10;2. The attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not is smaller in Wales than in England, with a gap of 34 points compared to 40 points, respectively.&#10;3. There has been an increase in the number of children achieving basic level qualifications (Level 1) from 9.4% in 2006 to over 18% currently. This progress demonstrates improvements in education outcomes for Welsh students.&#10;4. The change in performance measures for English literature GCSE exams has led to a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the exam, particularly those entitled to free school meals, which can contribute positively to literacy and oracy standards as well as help close the attainment gap." />
    <node id=" not eligible for free school meals. Unfortunately, the problem persists, doesn't it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. We are not where we need to be in terms of the performance, not only of our children on free school meals, but the performance of our looked-after children, and the performance of some children from some ethnic minority groups. So, we will continue to look to support those learners in a variety of ways, again looking to amend our practice on the basis of evidence that is given to us from our experts who are there to advise us. There is clearly more that we need to do. There has been some progress in some areas, but it is not where I would want it to be.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But, this is despite the fact that there is £475 million that has been invested in the pupil development grant, for this exact purpose of closing the attainment gap. But, the problem persists, and in some places, it's deteriorating.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think that, as I said, I am not shying away from any assumption or declaration that we need to do better. But, I do think" />

This approach aims to address fundamental issues within the school, evaluate its capacity for self-improvement, and provide additional support to the senior management team and governing body.&#10;&#10;2. Early warning systems: To better identify schools causing concern at an early stage, the government is looking into different sets of data, including carefully monitoring staff sickness levels. High levels of staff sickness have been found to correlate with issues within a school.&#10;&#10;3. Targeted pilot program: A new pilot has been launched in which local authorities identify two high schools they are particularly worried about. A multi-agency approach is used to work with these schools and provide extra support, aiming to address the persistent challenge of moving individual secondary schools forward at a faster pace. This pilot program is being evaluated by Cardiff Metropolitan University and Swansea University to assess its effectiveness.&#10;&#10;4. Collaboration: The government has collaborated with organizations like the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners to develop practical and usable self-evaluation resources for schools, promoting self-evaluation in the Welsh education system as it has been underdeveloped according to various chief inspectors' reports. This is expected to improve schools' ability to handle and educate students who repeatedly struggle with GCSEs." />
    <node id=" is very, very positive. Actually, we've had local authorities coming to us and saying, 'Can we put more schools in? Rather than just having two of our high schools, can we engage more in this project and this pilot?' It's being evaluated by Cardiff Metropolitan University and Swansea University, so we're having some academic overview to see, actually, does this approach work, can we evidence it—that it actually makes a difference? And it's actually—I'd like to claim all the credit for it, but it's actually not dissimilar to something that's happening in Scotland as well. But we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly wasn't moving these schools, we needed a new approach, and this is what we're doing at the moment. So it's relatively new, but the initial feedback is positive. Steve, I don't know—&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: I think your important point is about, 'What about the schools that are sliding in that direction?' And it's bringing together what we know from Estyn, but also, critically, local authorities have knowledge of their schools, and so do consortia. We've got to be better at bringing those together. So, the Minister gave the example" />
    <node id="1. The mixed picture of attainment across minority ethnic groups in Wales involves varying levels of performance. For instance, Black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals perform almost at the national average for all children, while Black Welsh boys do not. Similarly, White Welsh boys also underperform. This diverse performance highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding and targeted resources to address underachievement in specific areas (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;2. To address this issue, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children. By having a more sophisticated conversation about attainment across different subgroups, resources can be better targeted and help in understanding the differences within the diverse minority ethnic group (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;3. This approach will ensure that efforts are focused on addressing the root causes of underachievement among certain subgroups, ultimately leading to more equitable education outcomes for all students." />
    <node id="1. The expectation for the system being discussed is to be capable of improving at all levels, not just in certain areas. This means that it should be able to drive improvements in performance across all domains and domains, similar to what was achieved in the past.&#10;2. One specific expectation mentioned is the need to change the performance indicators around science. The reason for this is that a previous policy on science entries and qualifications resulted in poor science scores. By changing the performance indicators, it is expected that more children will have the opportunity to sit for a GCSE in science, leading to an improvement in PISA scores.&#10;3. Additionally, the system should be able to address specific issues such as the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not. To this end, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children.&#10;4. The system should also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of interim measures put in place to improve education outcomes. This evaluation will take time, as it requires a research base of two to three years, and will not be completed until 2025 when the new qualifications for the new curriculum are implemented. However, the broad structure of the interim measures is expected to continue over this time, with some tweaks for consistency." />
    <node id="?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: First, we have to have a system that is capable of doing all of those of things at the same time. We can't accept a system that says, 'Well, we can do a bit over here, but that means we have to—.' We have to have a system, Suzy, that can drive improvements at all levels. That's my expectation.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: The balloon needs to be bigger not just squeezing it at one end.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes. That's my expectation of this system. You have to deliver across all of these. We have seen some progress. As I've said, it's far from perfect, and we've got more work to do, but we have to deliver across all three domains, as we did last time. And I'm not going to make any apologies for changing the performance indicators around science. It was a travesty that there were children who never had the opportunity to sit a science GCSE. We don't have to make assumptions about the nature of many, many, many of those children. We have seen a significant increase in the number of children who" />

It's what's wrapped around those interim measures that I touched on earlier: the other evidence that we bring to bear about the effectiveness of a school, but we do want to say to schools that on the whole, broadly speaking, the interim measures will carry on for two, three years.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, and the reason I asked that is right at the beginning of this session, the Minister said to the Chair that this £100 million that's going into school improvements will be going into things that work.

    <node id="1. Coverage: The school categorization system has expanded from initially only covering secondary schools to now encompassing the entire range of schools.&#10;2. Judgment elements: The elements used in making categorization judgments have been adjusted over time, with changes made based on feedback and evolving requirements. This includes a shift towards looking at ways of identifying support for schools, using a risk-based approach to evaluate where resources should be spent.&#10;3. Frequency of Estyn inspections: The frequency of Estyn inspections has changed, with the initial seven-year inspection interval now evolving into a system where Estyn will be more regularly present in schools. This is part of an effort to ensure that Estyn is not just making judgments but also being part of the solution for school improvement.&#10;4. Further adjustments: While continuous improvements have been made based on feedback, there is no explicit mention of specific ongoing plans for further adjustments to the school categorization system. The speakers mainly focus on how the system has evolved and its current state rather than future changes. They do mention that both the categorization system and Estyn inspections are evolving, but no specifics are provided." />
    <node id="According to the transcript, there were no significant disputes or major conflicting ideas that made it difficult to develop the resource for school leadership teams. The process of creating the resource involved co-construction and collaboration with practitioners, including a head from the small school of Gladestry. These practitioners found value in working together with Estyn and the OECD to shape the resource. The aim is to ensure that the final product is useful for school leadership teams, as something of theoretical interest but no practical use would not yield the desired impact. At present, they are in phase 2, testing and evaluating the initial resource developed by the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners, with plans to implement it across the system in September 2020." />

We're in phase 2 at the moment, where we're doing—. So, the initial resource has been developed by the OECD, middle tier and practitioners. We're in the testing phase at the moment and having it evaluated itself, with a view to introducing that resource across the system at the start of the new academic year, in September 2020. I truly believe that, if we're to make progress in Welsh education, we have to develop the skills within our system to have robust self-evaluation. This resource gives us continuity of approach right the way across Wales. So, it's not left to an individual school to come up with a system; it's right the way across the system.

Reformed approach to PDG LAC and the employment of PDG LAC coordinators across regions&#10;2. Identification of new resources for testing new approaches, such as virtual school approaches&#10;3. A focus on sustainable improvement over time by shifting from short-term fixes to long-term plans&#10;4.

You are right: in recent years, the data have been poor and not where we would want it to be. That's why we have had a reformed approach to PDG LAC; the employment of PDG LAC co-ordinators across the regions. We've identified new resource in the new financial year to test new approaches, so, for instance, virtual school approaches, where we know, in other systems, that has worked. But, we expect the next set of data around the performance of this particular group of learners in March.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, and you hope to see progress.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I don't want to speculate, but I hope so.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Introduction of a new multi-agency approach: The Welsh government, in collaboration with Estyn, has introduced a new multi-agency approach to identify and support schools (specifically mentioned as high schools in the provided context) requiring significant improvement and special measures earlier. This approach focuses on addressing fundamental issues within the school, evaluating the school's capacity for self-improvement, and providing additional support to the senior management team and governing body.&#10;&#10;2. Difference from traditional methods: In traditional methods, Estyn would make a judgment on the school and then return for another inspection after a certain period (e.g., six months). However, under this new approach, Estyn is part of the solution rather than just making judgments. The multi-agency panel, which includes Estyn, works collaboratively with the school to support its improvement continuously, creating a more integrated and supportive environment for change." />
    <node id="The group is currently engaging with officials to agree on a plan to support the successful implementation of the curriculum. This plan is crucial to ensure clarity about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier during the implementation phase following the publication of the curriculum. The group's focus on implementation stems from the recognition that previous devolution efforts have resulted in fantastic documents but patchy implementation. The curriculum's significance and quality make it too important to be left to chance, requiring a relentless focus on successful implementation.&#10;&#10;In addition, the group will not disband after completing this task, as they have an ongoing role in overseeing the middle tier. This group operates at arm's length from the government, and while they do not report formally, they provide feedback to the Minister. The strategic delivery group is also considering a national service model with local accountability for monitoring and consistency purposes.&#10;&#10;As for the ERW (Education Through Regional Working) regional school improvement service, there are concerns about Neath Port Talbot's potential withdrawal from the consortium. While the Welsh Government does not intend to intervene directly, they seek clarification on Neath Port Talbot's plans to fulfill their functions in absence of ERW, especially considering the critical time for introducing the new curriculum. The government aims to ensure that schools and students are not disadvantaged without the support from ERW." />

    <node id="1. PISA's utility for school improvement: Kirsty Williams AM considers PISA as one of several useful tools for measuring school performance and systemic health. Its consistency makes it an important part of evaluating the education system, even though she acknowledges that it may not be enjoyable to monitor.&#10;&#10;2. Effective measurement of student well-being: Student well-being can be measured through a whole-school approach by assessing the overall culture and climate of the school. This method captures how the school addresses well-being rather than holding schools accountable for specific circumstances beyond their control, such as students' living conditions or family situations.&#10;&#10;3. Addressing student well-being in schools: To effectively address student well-being within a whole-school approach, proper interpretation and use of data can challenge local education authorities (LEAs) to critically think about their education system's performance. This self-reflection encourages more informed decision-making, targeted resource allocation, and the identification of specific areas for improvement.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding complacency: Presenting data that compares local authorities should discourage complacency among those above the average or better than their neighbors. Emphasizing appropriate data use helps LEAs strive for continuous improvement in educational standards instead of settling for a false sense of security.&#10;&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation allows LEAs to recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority.&#10;&#10;In summary, PISA is a useful tool for measuring and improving school performance when used appropriately among other resources. Student well-being can be effectively measured through a whole-school approach, emphasizing self-reflection and avoiding accountability for circumstances outside of schools' control. Encouraging LEAs to continuously improve and identify specific areas in need of support will help create an education system that fosters both high academic achievement and student well-being." />

Exams are important—of course they are, qualifications are important—but the way in which those schools achieve those results are also important.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Would you anticipate that including well-being, then?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: In a whole-school approach.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I absolutely—and we need to find a way of how we can truly measure that. Sometimes, children's well-being is influenced by lots of things outside the control of a school. So, I don't want schools to be held accountable for things that they have no control over, because of the circumstances in which a child may be living. But, absolutely: well-being and how the culture of the school addresses well-being is really important to me.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Suzy.

    <node id="50% of school funding has been directed towards professional learning for teaching staff. This investment has been driven by evidence on international best practices and what works in driving up educational standards.

    <node id="1. Multi-agency approach implementation: The Welsh government has introduced a new multi-agency approach to identify and support secondary schools requiring significant improvement and special measures earlier. This approach focuses on addressing fundamental issues within the school, evaluating the school's capacity for self-improvement, and providing additional support to the senior management team and governing body.&#10;&#10;2. Encouraging proactive local authority intervention: Local authorities are being encouraged to take a more active role in intervening and using their powers effectively. This includes developing better data analysis tools, like monitoring staff sickness rates, to identify potential issues in schools earlier.&#10;&#10;3. Early warning systems development: The government is looking into different sets of data that can serve as early warning systems, including carefully monitoring staff sickness levels, to further identify schools causing concern at an early stage.&#10;&#10;4. Targeted pilot program: A new pilot has been launched where local authorities identify two high schools they are particularly worried about, and a multi-agency approach is used to work with these schools and provide extra support, aiming to address the persistent challenge of moving individual secondary schools forward at a faster pace.&#10;&#10;5. Collaboration for self-evaluation resource development: The government has collaborated with organizations like the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners to develop practical and usable self-evaluation resources for schools. This effort aims to improve schools' ability to handle and educate students who repeatedly struggle with GCSEs by promoting self-evaluation in the Welsh education system as it has been underdeveloped according to various chief inspectors' reports.&#10;&#10;By implementing these measures, the Welsh government is working to address the concern that 11% of secondary schools inspected in the past two academic years were judged as unsatisfactory and in urgent need of improvement." />

    <node id=" thank the committee for their invitation this morning, and their interest in this particular area? As you will be aware, on coming into office, the director and I agreed to ask the OECD to do a rapid review of the state of Welsh education at the beginning of this Assembly term. They did that, and the feedback from that work informed the publication and content of the national mission. I was very clear in the national mission that I would invite the OECD back to review our progress against that mission, and that has happened in the tail end of last year, and the OECD will publish their latest report on Welsh education next month now, in March. So, the expectation is that the report will be published on 23 March, and my intention is to make a statement to the Chamber on 24 March. The nature of that review is part of our ongoing development of self-evaluation. So, we talk a lot about self-evaluation in the school system. Actually, the continuing relationship with OECD is about self-evaluation of the entirety of the system and Welsh Government. We don't want to accept our own orthodoxy and just be in a bubble where we are constantly listening to ourselves and those people who might want to agree with us or tell us what we want to" />

We didn't just send a letter out collectively. We've now carried out training jointly with WLGA and Estyn on how to use that data. So, it's not just looking where your LA is; it's also not looking at whether your school's better than average for the authority. And it is well received, and it should broaden the approach of scrutiny committees to beyond what historically was, if I'm honest, looking at the league table for their authority or looking at the league table of local authorities. It's not that they shouldn't be looking at that, but they need to dig much, much deeper underneath it.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We're going to go on now to Suzy.

    <node id="1. Breadth across a range of subjects: The new third-third-third system for schools emphasizes the importance of having breadth across various subjects rather than focusing on a narrower set of subject opportunities for children. This ensures that students are exposed to and have the chance to explore different areas of learning.&#10;&#10;2. Progress for every child: The new system aims to ensure progress for every child, rather than just looking at the performance of certain cohorts or groups. This includes focusing on the impact on disadvantaged children and ensuring that they are not left behind.&#10;&#10;3. Disadvantaged backgrounds: By analyzing capped 9 scores and other data sources, schools can better understand the performance of their free school meal (FSM) eligible students and work towards reducing the attainment gap between these learners and their peers.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum choice: The new system encourages a more diverse curriculum choice to cater to the needs and interests of all students, rather than narrowing the curriculum to focus only on subjects that are traditionally associated with high performance in exams.&#10;&#10;5. Cohorts of children with different abilities: The new third-third-third system challenges schools to look beyond just the C/D boundaries and ensure that they are pushing more able and talented students while also supporting those for whom attending school daily is an achievement. This helps create a more balanced approach to student progress and success, regardless of their ability level." />
    <node id=" sure that there is breadth across a range of subjects, rather than just focusing on a narrower and narrower bunch of subject opportunities for children, and our new third-third-third system enables schools to really look at their performance. So if their capped 9 score is high, what's driving that? Is it because the bottom third of the cohort is doing really well, and the impact on those children is above and beyond what could be expected, but actually, you're not doing very well for your more able and talented; you're not pushing them on? Alternatively, maybe your capped 9 score is because your MAT children are doing incredibly well, but actually, you're not really making the progress for the middle tier of those children. It allows us to have a greater focus on the performance of our FSM children—where they really are within that system. So, it's a much more granular—. And crucially for me, it looks at the impact for every child, because every child has to matter in the system, and what we had before was a narrowing of curriculum choice and a narrowing on a certain cohort of children.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: So are the permanent measures likely to be pretty similar to what you've got now?" />

[Laughter.] I think it's inevitable: whatever kind of measures we put in place, people will look to maximise their success in those measures, and I don't think we'll ever come up with a system where those measures are absolutely perfect. What's really important to me is that we're really, really, really challenging schools to look at the performance of all of their children, rather than just at a very, very narrow cohort around those C/D boundaries, which we knew was detrimental, potentially, to more able and talented children and really pushing those Bs to As and those As to A*s, and children for whom actually just getting in to school on a daily basis is an achievement, and the school has done well to provide that.

    <node id="1. The effectiveness of the regional consortia, including Education Through Regional Working (ERW), is not determined by their differences in constitution and organization, but rather by their ability to deliver improvements for children and teachers.&#10;2. Kirsty Williams, the Education Minister, stated that she is interested in the effectiveness of these organizations, not their structure. She believes that larger units are necessary for successful school improvement work and warned against going back to a system where school improvement services are organized in 22 different ways (one for each local authority).&#10;3. There have been variations in performance among regional consortia, with some performing exceptionally well and others requiring improvement. However, there is no specific concern mentioned about ERW's effectiveness compared to the other consortia.&#10;4. The focus remains on ensuring that school improvement services, whether provided by regional consortia or local authorities, are effective in delivering positive outcomes for children and teachers. This includes investing in professional learning for teaching staff, which has been shown to drive up educational standards." />
    <node id="1. Expansion of coverage: The school categorization system has evolved from initially only covering secondary schools to now encompassing the entire range of schools. This expansion allows for a more comprehensive assessment of educational institutions at all levels.&#10;2. Changes in judgment elements: Over time, the elements used in making categorization judgments have shifted away from being solely data-driven. Adjustments have been made based on feedback and evolving requirements to create a more holistic evaluation method that includes both data and the Estyn inspection regime.&#10;3. Increased frequency of Estyn inspections: The interval between Estyn inspections has changed, with the initial seven-year period now evolving into a system where Estyn is more regularly present in schools. This shift allows for continuous evaluation and support, rather than periodic judgments.&#10;4. Introduction of multi-agency approach: In addition to these changes, the Welsh government and Estyn have introduced a new multi-agency approach to identify and support schools requiring significant improvement and special measures. This collaborative method focuses on addressing fundamental issues within the school, evaluating self-improvement capacity, and providing additional support to the senior management team and governing body, further enhancing the overall system's effectiveness in promoting school improvement." />

    <edge source="1. Introduction of a more able and talented budget and the Seren programme: The new budget aims to support more able and talented children to improve their performance, specifically at higher levels (Level 5 and Level 6). The Seren program will be delivered post-16 and its principles will be introduced earlier in children's education, from Year 9 onwards. This is expected to drive improvements in the overall performance of students.&#10;2. Focusing on reading skills, especially for boys: Recognizing that there is a significant gap between Welsh students and their UK counterparts, as well as an evident disparity between girls' and boys' reading scores, efforts will be made to work with southern Ireland, who have consistently done well in this area. The goal is to learn from their success and improve the reading skills of Welsh children, especially boys.&#10;3. Maintaining support for math and science: Although there has been some success and encouragement in math and science, the new budget and Seren program do not aim to shift focus away from these subjects. The goal is to ensure that improvements in other areas, such as reading and supporting more able and talented children, do not come at the expense of success in math and science.&#10;4. Sustainable improvement: A more strategic, longer-term approach will be taken to address underlying challenges in schools, ensuring that any improvements made are sustainable and not just short-term gains achieved through &quot;easy wins.&quot; This approach aims to tackle deeper issues within schools that may cause them to slip back after initial improvements.&#10;5. Supporting minority ethnic learners: A ring-fenced grant of £10 million will be maintained for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children, with a commitment to having a more sophisticated conversation about what is really going on in attainment across minority ethnic groups. This will help best target resources and understand differences within this diverse group." target=" That's one of the reasons why we have introduced a more able and talented budget to support that, and our Seren programme, which is delivering fantastic results post-16. That's why we're introducing the principles of Seren earlier into children's careers, bringing it down from year 9 upwards, to be able to drive improvements. So, I think that that's the area that we are particularly keen to work on: making sure that more of our children perform at the OECD average at level 5 and level 6.

The mixed picture of attainment across minority ethnic groups in Wales involves varying levels of performance. For instance, Black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals perform almost at the national average for all children, while Black Welsh boys do not. Similarly, White Welsh boys also underperform. This diverse performance highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding and targeted resources to address underachievement in specific areas (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;2. To address this issue, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children. By having a more sophisticated conversation about attainment across different subgroups, resources can be better targeted and help in understanding the differences within the diverse minority ethnic group (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;3. This approach will ensure that efforts are focused on addressing the root causes of underachievement among certain subgroups, ultimately leading to more equitable education outcomes for all students.">

That's why we're introducing the principles of Seren earlier into children's careers, bringing it down from year 9 upwards, to be able to drive improvements. So, I think that that's the area that we are particularly keen to work on: making sure that more of our children perform at the OECD average at level 5 and level 6.

We are working with southern Ireland, who have consistently done well with reading scores, to look to see what lessons we can learn to press on with there with reading.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. My final question on this. You recognise it as a priority, particularly for boys. Does that mean that the focus will then drift slightly from maths, where there has been some success; and drift from science, where the encouragement of more people to take GCSE science has reduced the number of high-level passes?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: First, we have to have a system that is capable of doing all of those of things at the" target="1. The expectation for the system being discussed is to be capable of improving at all levels, not just in certain areas. This means that it should be able to drive improvements in performance across all domains and domains, similar to what was achieved in the past.&#10;2. One specific expectation mentioned is the need to change the performance indicators around science. The reason for this is that a previous policy on science entries and qualifications resulted in poor science scores. By changing the performance indicators, it is expected that more children will have the opportunity to sit for a GCSE in science, leading to an improvement in PISA scores.&#10;3. Additionally, the system should be able to address specific issues such as the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not. To this end, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children.&#10;4. The system should also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of interim measures put in place to improve education outcomes. This evaluation will take time, as it requires a research base of two to three years, and will not be completed until 2025 when the new qualifications for the new curriculum are implemented. However, the broad structure of the interim measures is expected to continue over this time, with some tweaks for consistency.">

You are absolutely correct: there is a real mixed picture. If we look at black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals, they perform almost at the national average for all children—not FSM children; the national average for all children. Black Welsh boys don't, but neither do white Welsh boys. So, there is a really complex picture here, and I really welcome a debate about acknowledging the various levels of performance of BAME children, and where" target="1. The mixed picture of attainment across minority ethnic groups in Wales involves varying levels of performance. For instance, Black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals perform almost at the national average for all children, while Black Welsh boys do not. Similarly, White Welsh boys also underperform. This diverse performance highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding and targeted resources to address underachievement in specific areas (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;2. To address this issue, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children. By having a more sophisticated conversation about attainment across different subgroups, resources can be better targeted and help in understanding the differences within the diverse minority ethnic group (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;3. This approach will ensure that efforts are focused on addressing the root causes of underachievement among certain subgroups, ultimately leading to more equitable education outcomes for all students.">

That system is primarily there as a triage system around identifying where our resource should be spent. So, our school improvement service—it's a risk-based approach, so they can evaluate where they need to put their time, effort and resource. Sometimes, it's used by other people for other things, but that is not its primary purpose; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability, it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available. Estyn—now that is part of that accountability system. That is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do.

So, for instance, what would normally happen, Estyn would come in, Estyn would make a judgment on the school—requiring special measures or urgent improvement—and Estyn would go away. They'd go away for six months, and then they'd come back in six months, and they'd make another judgment, 'No, still not good enough', and disappear for six months. We're saying—Estyn and the Welsh Government have agreed that's not the best approach; Estyn need to be part of the solution, rather than just coming and making a judgment.

Comparisons can be misleading: Local education authorities (LEAs) should not rely solely on being above the national average or comparing themselves to neighboring authorities because such comparisons can be misleading. A local authority that is above the national average may still have room for improvement, and complacency could hinder further progress.&#10;2. Encouraging self-reflection: Proper interpretation and use of data challenge LEAs to think critically about their education system's performance. This approach encourages self-reflection and promotes a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses within the local education authority, leading to more informed decision-making.&#10;3. Identifying areas for improvement: When LEAs pay close attention to their data, they are better equipped to identify specific areas where improvements are needed.

Avoiding a false sense of security: Presenting data that compares local authorities can create a false sense of security for those above the average or better than their neighbors.

Recent changes in performance measures for English literature GCSE exams in Wales have had a positive impact on the number of students taking the exam, especially those entitled to free school meals.&#10;2. Previously, a performance measure around English was introduced which led to significant numbers of children, particularly those entitled to free school meals, not sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;3. This performance measure was changed last year, resulting in a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;4. The rationale behind these changes is that studying literature is essential for the development of literacy and oracy standards, introducing children to the joy of reading and the written word. It also helps in reducing the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not.">

Maintaining support for math and science: Although there have been some successes and encouragement in math and science, the new budget and Seren program do not aim to shift focus away from these subjects. The goal is to ensure that improvements in other areas do not come at the expense of success in math and science.&#10;&#10;4. Sustainable improvement: A more strategic, longer-term approach will be taken to address underlying challenges in schools, ensuring that any improvements made are sustainable and not just short-term gains achieved through &quot;easy wins.&quot; This approach aims to tackle deeper issues within schools that may cause them to slip back after initial improvements.&#10;&#10;5.

Its consistency makes it an important part of evaluating the education system, even though she acknowledges that it may not be enjoyable to monitor.&#10;&#10;2. Effective measurement of student well-being: Student well-being can be measured through a whole-school approach by assessing the overall culture and climate of the school. This method captures how the school addresses well-being rather than holding schools accountable for specific circumstances beyond their control, such as students' living conditions or family situations.&#10;&#10;3. Addressing student well-being in schools: To effectively address student well-being within a whole-school approach, proper interpretation and use of data can challenge local education authorities (LEAs) to critically think about their education system's performance. This self-reflection encourages more informed decision-making, targeted resource allocation, and the identification of specific areas for improvement.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding complacency: Presenting data that compares local authorities should discourage complacency among those above the average or better than their neighbors. Emphasizing appropriate data use helps LEAs strive for continuous improvement in educational standards instead of settling for a false sense of security.&#10;&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation allows LEAs to recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority.&#10;&#10;In summary, PISA is a useful tool for measuring and improving school performance when used appropriately among other resources. Student well-being can be effectively measured through a whole-school approach, emphasizing self-reflection and avoiding accountability for circumstances outside of schools' control. Encouraging LEAs to continuously improve and identify specific areas in need of support will help create an education system that fosters both high academic achievement and student well-being.">

There are other local authorities who don't seem to have used them. Since that legislation came into being, there have been a number of reasons, because of course a local authority has to give a reason for using those powers of intervention. They usually focus on standards, but sometimes they focus on a breakdown in governance arrangements, perhaps, or a failure or a breakdown in financial management. So, sometimes the budgetary issues trigger an intervention power. And the types of interventions that have been used have included, in some cases, appointing additional governors to governing bodies, or suspending a school's delegated budget so the local authority takes on, then, financial control of that particular school">

Comparisons can be misleading: Local education authorities (LEAs) should not rely solely on being above the national average or comparing themselves to neighboring authorities because such comparisons can be misleading. A local authority that is above the national average may still have room for improvement, and complacency could hinder further progress.&#10;2. Encouraging self-reflection: Proper interpretation and use of data challenge LEAs to think critically about their education system's performance. This approach encourages self-reflection and promotes a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses within the local education authority, leading to more informed decision-making.&#10;3. Identifying areas for improvement: When LEAs pay close attention to their data, they are better equipped to identify specific areas where improvements are needed.

The aim is to ensure that the final product is useful for school leadership teams, as something of theoretical interest but no practical use would not yield the desired impact. At present, they are in phase 2, testing and evaluating the initial resource developed by the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners, with plans to implement it across the system in September 2020.">

PISA's utility for school improvement: Kirsty Williams AM considers PISA as one of several useful tools for measuring school performance and systemic health. Its consistency makes it an important part of evaluating the education system, even though she acknowledges that it may not be enjoyable to monitor.&#10;&#10;2. Effective measurement of student well-being: Student well-being can be measured through a whole-school approach by assessing the overall culture and climate of the school. This method captures how the school addresses well-being rather than holding schools accountable for specific circumstances beyond their control, such as students' living conditions or family situations.&#10;&#10;3. Addressing student well-being in schools: To effectively address student well-being within a whole-school approach, proper interpretation and use of data can challenge local education authorities (LEAs) to critically think about their education system's performance. This self-reflection encourages more informed decision-making, targeted resource allocation, and the identification of specific areas for improvement.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding complacency: Presenting data that compares local authorities should discourage complacency among those above the average or better than their neighbors. Emphasizing appropriate data use helps LEAs strive for continuous improvement in educational standards instead of settling for a false sense of security.&#10;&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation allows LEAs to recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority.&#10;&#10;In summary, PISA is a useful tool for measuring and improving school performance when used appropriately among other resources. Student well-being can be effectively measured through a whole-school approach, emphasizing self-reflection and avoiding accountability for circumstances outside of schools' control. Encouraging LEAs to continuously improve and identify specific areas in need of support will help create an education system that fosters both high academic achievement and student well-being.">

Recent changes in performance measures for English literature GCSE exams in Wales have had a positive impact on the number of students taking the exam, especially those entitled to free school meals.&#10;2. Previously, a performance measure around English was introduced which led to significant numbers of children, particularly those entitled to free school meals, not sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;3. This performance measure was changed last year, resulting in a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;4. The rationale behind these changes is that studying literature is essential for the development of literacy and oracy standards, introducing children to the joy of reading and the written word. It also helps in reducing the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not.">

The expectation for the system being discussed is to be capable of improving at all levels, not just in certain areas. This means that it should be able to drive improvements in performance across all domains and domains, similar to what was achieved in the past.&#10;2. One specific expectation mentioned is the need to change the performance indicators around science. The reason for this is that a previous policy on science entries and qualifications resulted in poor science scores. By changing the performance indicators, it is expected that more children will have the opportunity to sit for a GCSE in science, leading to an improvement in PISA scores.&#10;3. Additionally, the system should be able to address specific issues such as the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not. To this end, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children.&#10;4. The system should also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of interim measures put in place to improve education outcomes. This evaluation will take time, as it requires a research base of two to three years, and will not be completed until 2025 when the new qualifications for the new curriculum are implemented. However, the broad structure of the interim measures is expected to continue over this time, with some tweaks for consistency.">

Comparisons can be misleading: Local education authorities (LEAs) should not rely solely on being above the national average or comparing themselves to neighboring authorities because such comparisons can be misleading. A local authority that is above the national average may still have room for improvement, and complacency could hinder further progress.&#10;2.

Recent changes in performance measures for English literature GCSE exams in Wales have had a positive impact on the number of students taking the exam, especially those entitled to free school meals.&#10;2. Previously, a performance measure around English was introduced which led to significant numbers of children, particularly those entitled to free school meals, not sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;3. This performance measure was changed last year, resulting in a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the English literature GCSE.&#10;4. The rationale behind these changes is that studying literature is essential for the development of literacy and oracy standards, introducing children to the joy of reading and the written word.

The mixed picture of attainment across minority ethnic groups in Wales involves varying levels of performance. For instance, Black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals perform almost at the national average for all children, while Black Welsh boys do not. Similarly, White Welsh boys also underperform. This diverse performance highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding and targeted resources to address underachievement in specific areas (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;2. To address this issue, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children. By having a more sophisticated conversation about attainment across different subgroups, resources can be better targeted and help in understanding the differences within the diverse minority ethnic group (Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM).&#10;3. This approach will ensure that efforts are focused on addressing the root causes of underachievement among certain subgroups, ultimately leading to more equitable education outcomes for all students.">

PISA's utility for school improvement: Kirsty Williams AM considers PISA as one of several useful tools for measuring school performance and systemic health. Its consistency makes it an important part of evaluating the education system, even though she acknowledges that it may not be enjoyable to monitor.&#10;&#10;2. Effective measurement of student well-being: Student well-being can be measured through a whole-school approach by assessing the overall culture and climate of the school. This method captures how the school addresses well-being rather than holding schools accountable for specific circumstances beyond their control, such as students' living conditions or family situations.&#10;&#10;3. Addressing student well-being in schools: To effectively address student well-being within a whole-school approach, proper interpretation and use of data can challenge local education authorities (LEAs) to critically think about their education system's performance. This self-reflection encourages more informed decision-making, targeted resource allocation, and the identification of specific areas for improvement.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding complacency: Presenting data that compares local authorities should discourage complacency among those above the average or better than their neighbors. Emphasizing appropriate data use helps LEAs strive for continuous improvement in educational standards instead of settling for a false sense of security.&#10;&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation allows LEAs to recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority.&#10;&#10;In summary, PISA is a useful tool for measuring and improving school performance when used appropriately among other resources. Student well-being can be effectively measured through a whole-school approach, emphasizing self-reflection and avoiding accountability for circumstances outside of schools' control. Encouraging LEAs to continuously improve and identify specific areas in need of support will help create an education system that fosters both high academic achievement and student well-being.">

Some work was undertaken in 2017 and 2018 to look to update that model and revise that model. Some specific recommendations were put forward about additional services that could be organised on a regional basis; primarily, that is a specialist human resources resource. We know that, because of austerity in some local authorities, HR departments have been really stretched. Education HR is a specialist service, it's not generic. It's often a service that—. I see that as part of a school improvement service. Support for governors also has been stretched within individual local authorities. So, a proposal was put forward to include specialist HR and governor support as part of the regional model. That was rejected by local government. Our local authorities did not want to include that in the regional model. However, I must say, having presented that evidence, some of our local authorities, even though there wasn't a national agreement to put that into the national model, have pooled their resources, and those services are being delivered and supported on a regional basis.

    <edge source="1. The previous performance measure around English literature GCSE resulted in significant numbers of children, particularly those entitled to free school meals, not sitting for the exam. This led to a narrow focus on certain parts of the cohort and curriculum.&#10;2. The performance measure was changed last year, leading to a significant increase in the number of children sitting for the English literature GCSE. This change is beneficial as studying literature is essential for the development of literacy and oracy standards, introducing children to the joy of reading and the written word. It also helps reduce the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not.&#10;3. The change in performance measures has resulted in the need to consider more indicators and gather evidence from different sources, which can be challenging. However, the Welsh government believes that the best interests of learners should always be the primary concern, even if it makes assessments more complex or difficult to compare over time.&#10;4.

Breadth across a range of subjects: The new third-third-third system for schools emphasizes the importance of having breadth across various subjects rather than focusing on a narrower set of subject opportunities for children. This ensures that students are exposed to and have the chance to explore different areas of learning.&#10;&#10;2. Progress for every child: The new system aims to ensure progress for every child, rather than just looking at the performance of certain cohorts or groups. This includes focusing on the impact on disadvantaged children and ensuring that they are not left behind.&#10;&#10;3. Disadvantaged backgrounds: By analyzing capped 9 scores and other data sources, schools can better understand the performance of their free school meal (FSM) eligible students and work towards reducing the attainment gap between these learners and their peers.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum choice: The new system encourages a more diverse curriculum choice to cater to the needs and interests of all students, rather than narrowing the curriculum to focus only on subjects that are traditionally associated with high performance in exams.&#10;&#10;5. Cohorts of children with different abilities: The new third-third-third system challenges schools to look beyond just the C/D boundaries and ensure that they are pushing more able and talented students while also supporting those for whom attending school daily is an achievement. This helps create a more balanced approach to student progress and success, regardless of their ability level.">

This means that it should be able to drive improvements in performance across all domains and domains, similar to what was achieved in the past.&#10;2. One specific expectation mentioned is the need to change the performance indicators around science. The reason for this is that a previous policy on science entries and qualifications resulted in poor science scores. By changing the performance indicators, it is expected that more children will have the opportunity to sit for a GCSE in science, leading to an improvement in PISA scores.&#10;3. Additionally, the system should be able to address specific issues such as the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not. To this end, the Welsh government has committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant of £10 million for local authorities to support the education of minority ethnic children.&#10;4. The system should also be able to evaluate the effectiveness of interim measures put in place to improve education outcomes. This evaluation will take time, as it requires a research base of two to three years, and will not be completed until 2025 when the new qualifications for the new curriculum are implemented. However, the broad structure of the interim measures is expected to continue over this time, with some tweaks for consistency.">

Breadth across a range of subjects: The new third-third-third system for schools emphasizes the importance of having breadth across various subjects rather than focusing on a narrower set of subject opportunities for children. This ensures that students are exposed to and have the chance to explore different areas of learning.&#10;&#10;2. Progress for every child: The new system aims to ensure progress for every child, rather than just looking at the performance of certain cohorts or groups. This includes focusing on the impact on disadvantaged children and ensuring that they are not left behind.&#10;&#10;3. Disadvantaged backgrounds: By analyzing capped 9 scores and other data sources, schools can better understand the performance of their free school meal (FSM) eligible students and work towards reducing the attainment gap between these learners and their peers.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum choice: The new system encourages a more diverse curriculum choice to cater to the needs and interests of all students, rather than narrowing the curriculum to focus only on subjects that are traditionally associated with high performance in exams.&#10;&#10;5. Cohorts of children with different abilities: The new third-third-third system challenges schools to look beyond just the C/D boundaries and ensure that they are pushing more able and talented students while also supporting those for whom attending school daily is an achievement. This helps create a more balanced approach to student progress and success, regardless of their ability level.">

PISA's utility for school improvement: Kirsty Williams AM considers PISA as one of several useful tools for measuring school performance and systemic health. Its consistency makes it an important part of evaluating the education system, even though she acknowledges that it may not be enjoyable to monitor.&#10;&#10;2. Effective measurement of student well-being: Student well-being can be measured through a whole-school approach by assessing the overall culture and climate of the school. This method captures how the school addresses well-being rather than holding schools accountable for specific circumstances beyond their control, such as students' living conditions or family situations.&#10;&#10;3. Addressing student well-being in schools: To effectively address student well-being within a whole-school approach, proper interpretation and use of data can challenge local education authorities (LEAs) to critically think about their education system's performance. This self-reflection encourages more informed decision-making, targeted resource allocation, and the identification of specific areas for improvement.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding complacency: Presenting data that compares local authorities should discourage complacency among those above the average or better than their neighbors. Emphasizing appropriate data use helps LEAs strive for continuous improvement in educational standards instead of settling for a false sense of security.&#10;&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation allows LEAs to recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority.&#10;&#10;In summary, PISA is a useful tool for measuring and improving school performance when used appropriately among other resources. Student well-being can be effectively measured through a whole-school approach, emphasizing self-reflection and avoiding accountability for circumstances outside of schools' control. Encouraging LEAs to continuously improve and identify specific areas in need of support will help create an education system that fosters both high academic achievement and student well-being.">

Disadvantaged backgrounds: By analyzing capped 9 scores and other data sources, schools can better understand the performance of their free school meal (FSM) eligible students and work towards reducing the attainment gap between these learners and their peers.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum choice: The new system encourages a more diverse curriculum choice to cater to the needs and interests of all students, rather than narrowing the curriculum to focus only on subjects that are traditionally associated with high performance in exams.&#10;&#10;5. Cohorts of children with different abilities: The new third-third-third system challenges schools to look beyond just the C/D boundaries and ensure that they are pushing more able and talented students while also supporting those for whom attending school daily is an achievement.

    <edge source="1. PISA's utility for school improvement: Kirsty Williams AM considers PISA as one of several useful tools for measuring school performance and systemic health. Its consistency makes it an important part of evaluating the education system, even though she acknowledges that it may not be enjoyable to monitor.&#10;&#10;2. Effective measurement of student well-being: Student well-being can be measured through a whole-school approach by assessing the overall culture and climate of the school. This method captures how the school addresses well-being rather than holding schools accountable for specific circumstances beyond their control, such as students' living conditions or family situations.&#10;&#10;3. Addressing student well-being in schools: To effectively address student well-being within a whole-school approach, proper interpretation and use of data can challenge local education authorities (LEAs) to critically think about their education system's performance. This self-reflection encourages more informed decision-making, targeted resource allocation, and the identification of specific areas for improvement.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding complacency: Presenting data that compares local authorities should discourage complacency among those above the average or better than their neighbors. Emphasizing appropriate data use helps LEAs strive for continuous improvement in educational standards instead of settling for a false sense of security.&#10;&#10;5. Highlighting individual school impact: Proper data interpretation allows LEAs to recognize the positive impact that individual schools have on their students, even if the overall authority performance may not be as strong. This focus on individual school success can inform best practices and inspire growth across the entire education system within the local authority.&#10;&#10;In summary, PISA is a useful tool for measuring and improving school performance when used appropriately among other resources. Student well-being can be effectively measured through a whole-school approach, emphasizing self-reflection and avoiding accountability for circumstances outside of schools' control. Encouraging LEAs to continuously improve and identify specific areas in need of support will help create an education system that fosters both high academic achievement and student well-being." target=".

    <edge source="1. Expansion of coverage: The school categorization system has evolved from initially only covering secondary schools to now encompassing the entire range of schools. This expansion allows for a more comprehensive assessment of educational institutions at all levels.&#10;2. Changes in judgment elements: Over time, the elements used in making categorization judgments have shifted away from being solely data-driven. Adjustments have been made based on feedback and evolving requirements to create a more holistic evaluation method that includes both data and the Estyn inspection regime.&#10;3. Increased frequency of Estyn inspections: The interval between Estyn inspections has changed, with the initial seven-year period now evolving into a system where Estyn is more regularly present in schools. This shift allows for continuous evaluation and support, rather than periodic judgments.&#10;4. Introduction of multi-agency approach: In addition to these changes, the Welsh government and Estyn have introduced a new multi-agency approach to identify and support schools requiring significant improvement and special measures. This collaborative method focuses on addressing fundamental issues within the school, evaluating self-improvement capacity, and providing additional support to the senior management team and governing body, further enhancing the overall system's effectiveness in promoting school improvement." target="1.

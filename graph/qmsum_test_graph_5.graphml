    <node id="The speakers decided to pick the first question from their list, which seemed to be the endpoint decision they had already discussed. When asked if this decision was correct, Professor B indicated that it wasn't a matter of true or false, but rather about how they wanted to combine those decisions when true. Grad E expressed a desire to keep the number of connections to each bottom decision manageable (no more than four). The conversation then moved on to discussing probability calculations related to their decision-making process.&#10;&#10;In summary, the decision reached was to pick the first question from their list, and they acknowledged that this decision wasn't a matter of being true or false but focused on how to combine decisions when true." />
    <node id=" you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: if we Yes .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So if {disfmarker} well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: These three ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah . Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: What ex um and so either those is true f or false ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh Uh well it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i here 's where it gets a little tricky .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's {disfmarker} it 's important to know what it 's" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And the {disfmarker} and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: What he has mentioned before .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK , so this is w Right , so what w I {disfmarker} what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: mm - hmm&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: mm - hmm&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Uh we can load it up" />
    <node id=" just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had &quot; Is he staying in our hotel ? &quot; , &quot; Is he staying with friends ? &quot; , and so forth&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: uh so we 're OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . So my suggestion is we just pick uh&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Something down here ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: one , you know one uh particular one of the uh well let 's do the first {disfmarker} first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the {disfmarker} of the endpoint ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . And um Oops .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Is hmm&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Ah ,&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So it 's true or false ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: No , that 's {disfmarker} that" />
    <node id=" be .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: could be&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: This is {disfmarker} this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next ,&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: so this&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: which is s if that 's true uh how do we wanna combine those ? O or when it 's true ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going f to each of the uh bottom decisions .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: And four you {disfmarker} we can handle .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: It 's too much ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big CPT" />
    <node id=" E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four .

Now&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Um Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Is that all OK ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: And that one outcome , that 's&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: What ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: it 's X {disfmarker} X - one voted for A X - two voted for V&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: and so forth ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Y right .

    <node id=" Does have to be there . And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: And Hmm ? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones . We can start with that . Interesting effect . Um Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Well {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Which one ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: what ?&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: &quot; Go there &quot; .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: m right .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: so there is this question about&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Here we we actually get just probabilities ,&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: right for each down here .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: When we 're {disfmarker} yeah when we 're done .

    <node id="The purpose of merging &quot;selling, fixing, and servicing&quot; within the belief-net point of view is to create an intermediate structure that simplifies the decision-making process by treating these options as equivalent for certain purposes. This means that, from the belief-net perspective, it doesn't matter if a person wants to sell, fix, or service something; what's important is knowing whether they are willing to enter a transaction or not. Other perspectives might have different priorities and require more specific distinctions between these options. The decision to merge these options in the belief-net was made to keep the number of connections to each bottom decision manageable (no more than four) and simplify probability calculations related to their decision-making process." />
    <node id=" likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: given that he knows it , of course .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Alright . So let me suggest this . Uh w could you move those up about halfway . Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Yeah , all {disfmarker} all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right . So here {disfmarker} here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of {disfmarker} of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: if we Yes .&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" a {disfmarker} a strong influence .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: But yeah , that was what he had in mind .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So let 's think about this {disfmarker} this question of how do we wanna handle {disfmarker} so there 're two separate things . One is {disfmarker} uh at least two . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . So the {disfmarker} let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's {disfmarker} it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So for this decision it 's just uh true or false&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: OK . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: That {disfmarker} that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Um more likely to enter .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: are more likely to enter .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: You could , yeah . Yeah , so let 's do that . No no , no eh to {disfmarker} to an inter no , an intermediate node .&#10;Speaker: Grad" />
    <node id=" let 's do that . No no , no eh to {disfmarker} to an inter no , an intermediate node .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: T&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Oh , OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: That 's the p part of the idea , is&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Um is {disfmarker} is that the object type node ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: I d&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: So are they the {disfmarker} is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Oh I just created it , it has none so far .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Yeah .

    <node id="In the context of Johno's pictogram, the term &quot;mode&quot; refers to the same concept as &quot;endpoint.&quot; The speakers were discussing the idea of combining three intermediate nodes - user model, ontology, and discourse - into a single node that represents an endpoint decision with three possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;Grad E mentioned a wish for symmetry in the picture, where each bottom decision would have no more than four connections. This led to the discussion of merging &quot;selling, fixing, and servicing&quot; options into a single intermediate structure, treating them as equivalent for certain purposes from the belief-net perspective.&#10;&#10;Professor B clarified that the semantics of the discourse will provide values for various decision nodes, including those related to the mode of transportation or similar complex concepts, ensuring that the output is not limited to a simple true/false value.&#10;&#10;In summary, &quot;mode&quot; in Johno's pictogram refers to an endpoint decision with three possible outcomes (similar to other endpoint decisions). The speakers considered combining these decisions into a single node while keeping the number of connections manageable and ensuring that the decision-making process remains simple and efficient." />
    <node id=": so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Uh we can load it up it you know very simple .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: So&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? But the {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: So this was adjusted for this one mode thing .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Oh yes .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: So that 's w w in our uh in {disfmarker} in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Oh , it was called mode , so this {disfmarker} this is m mode here means the same as endpoint .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Is" />
    <node id=" that um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: wow , what does that mean and uh&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Now . Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Alright . So&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: But is th is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each {disfmarker} each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E , sub - D , sub - U and maybe a sub - O {disfmarker} &quot; O &quot; for &quot; ontology &quot; um meta node&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: I don't know .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: but it might just&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: It could be .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: could be&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: This is {disfmarker} this is" />
    <node id=" ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Alright .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , OK uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . I j wa I {disfmarker} I assume everybody knows that , I just wanna you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes . And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means uh necessarily a simple thing that you want out . So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utter" />
    <node id="1.

Decision node properties decision: They will define certain properties that fit into the decision node, ensuring that these elements can be properly integrated into the belief-net for computation and analysis.

An example of this is using landmarks as part of a decision-making process if a thing is exhibiting certain characteristics or behaviors.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group is planning to consider various decisions related to &quot;path land&quot; that will help them define the relationships between elements, establish belief nodes for computation, and integrate embedded decisions from their previous work." />
    <node id=" on this&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to {disfmarker} to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land . And what they 're gonna look like .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: So you can save this one as and open up the old one , right and {disfmarker} and then everything would be clean . You could do it again .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Why , I think it 's worth saving this one but I think I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd like to keep this one&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: cuz I wanna see if {disfmarker} if we 're gonna reuse any of this stuff .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Um so this might be What next ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Well you tell me , so in terms of the uh planner what 's {disfmarker" />
    <node id=" know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions and actually I had uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones . The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done and so to do that so there 's {disfmarker} and the idea was we were gonna do two things&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Is your mike on ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Ah . Oh right , well . Yeah . We were gonna do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: That 's funny .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and then as a uh separate but related task uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we {disfmarker} what we need to do . Once so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . So I didn't {disfmarker} did you get a chance to look at all {disfmarker} yet ?&#10;Speaker: Grad" />
    <node id=" uh is it something you physically could enter&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK , et cetera . So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Now&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right . Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark ,&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;" />
    <node id="A mixture of experts system determines which expert to trust in a given situation by using a hidden variable (H) that decides which of the experts is most reliable based on the input values from X-1, X-2, X-3, and X-4. The H node looks at these four values and produces a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponding to the selected expert. This system allows for a more adaptable and reliable decision-making process by evaluating the input data and selecting the most appropriate expert accordingly. In this implementation, the H variable is responsible for managing the combination of decisions made by individual experts based on their inputs and making a final choice among them. The selection process can be predefined or learned from training data, requiring data with people's intentions to properly determine the best course of action." />
    <node id=" experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called &quot; H &quot; , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . Right , so you can have a mixture that&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;" />
    <node id="d be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh {comment} W one times {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Point three .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: or A or {disfmarker} let 's see , one full quarter times point one&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Not one quarter ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four .

Yeah . OK . So , alright . So this is uh step two . So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts" />
    <node id=" ?&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Right , so I mean the way you desc&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the {disfmarker} that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . Hmm . OK . OK . I mean It {disfmarker} it just seems that like without that {disfmarker} that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if {disfmarker} if uh X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,&#10;Speaker: Grad" />
    <node id=" These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of {disfmarker} we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Hmm . ROVER , the ROVER decision .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: The what decision ?&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: ROVER . All of their outputs combined to make a decision .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah . So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So um that 's what we want , we want for example P of um let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E given that these" />
    <node id=" i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: right ? Oh , OK . OK . Alright , right .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they {disfmarker} they could either be hand coded or learned or OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Based on training data , OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah . Yes .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . Oh yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .

    <node id="Professor B suggests adding an intermediate node between the user and the endpoint decision in their conversation. This intermediate node would serve as a place where the user model, situation model, and discourse model could all connect.

    <node id=" and so I {disfmarker} I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So that {disfmarker} that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: We {disfmarker} we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Of {disfmarker} of course .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Identified that&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet .

    <node id=" the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: I guess the final&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . And I {disfmarker} don't worry about layout ,&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: I mean then we 'll go {disfmarker} we 'll go nuts but&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Could be , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Right .

    <node id=": Right .

    <node id="1. The group planned to establish the basic design of what influences what in their project, focusing on &quot;path land&quot; as the initial context. This involved determining the relationships between different elements and how they affect each other within this domain (influence structure decision).&#10;2. They also decided to identify the types of belief nodes needed for necessary tasks in &quot;path land,&quot; which are essential for their decision-making process, representing decisions and conditions that can be influenced by other factors (belief nodes decision).&#10;3. Additionally, the team agreed to define certain properties that fit into the decision node, ensuring that these elements could be properly integrated into the belief-net for computation and analysis (decision node properties decision).&#10;4. The group aimed to embed previous decisions within other final decisions in their current structure, using landmarks as part of a decision-making process if a thing is exhibiting certain characteristics or behaviors (embedded decisions).&#10;5. Starting with path-related decisions was the agreed-upon approach before moving on to other aspects of the project." />
    <node id="In this discussion, the &quot;endpoint&quot; refers to a decision node with multiple possible outcomes. The different values or options for the endpoint are not explicitly stated in the transcript, but they seem to be related to modes of transportation or similar complex concepts.&#10;&#10;Professor B suggests merging three intermediate nodes - user model, ontology, and discourse - into a single node that represents an endpoint decision with three possible outcomes. This is agreed upon by Grad C and Grad A.&#10;&#10;Later in the discussion, Professor B brings up the idea of merging &quot;selling, fixing, and servicing&quot; options into a single intermediate structure, treating them as equivalent for certain purposes from the belief-net perspective. Grad E expresses a desire to keep the number of connections to each bottom decision manageable (no more than four).&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the exact values or options for the endpoint are not specified, it is clear that there are at least three possible outcomes for each endpoint decision, and possibly more depending on whether &quot;selling, fixing, and servicing&quot; are considered as separate options or combined into a single structure. The number of possible options for each endpoint decision is still being discussed and has not been finalized by the participants in the conversation." />

    <node id="1. The speakers are discussing a program or tool that can solve belief networks (a type of probabilistic graphical model) and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI).&#10;2. They are considering the idea of creating multiple belief-net displays, each focusing on different subsets of nodes and relationships within the network. This would allow users to examine specific parts of the network more easily without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire model.&#10;3. One suggestion is to have an option where clicking on a node (referred to as &quot;endpoint&quot; or &quot;mode&quot;) highlights relevant links while dimming other elements in the interface, making it easier for users to focus on specific parts of the network.&#10;4. The speakers are also discussing how the belief-net program will interact with ontologies, which are formal representations of knowledge within a specific domain. They aim to create a system where properties from the ontology can be used to fill in and update the values of nodes within the belief-net.&#10;5. The speakers mention that defining the decision node properties is an essential step in integrating these elements into the belief-net for computation and analysis. This includes determining how someone would find a word, look it up in the ontology, pull out relevant properties, and put it into the belief-net for decision flow.&#10;6. The speakers express concern about the readability of complex diagrams with multiple nodes and connections, suggesting that they need to figure out a display hack or some other solution to make the visualization more manageable and user-friendly." />

    <node id="Adding a specific feature for just one decision can have both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, it allows for tailoring the system to address unique requirements of that particular decision, potentially improving its accuracy or functionality. It also offers the opportunity to create an optimized solution without worrying about compatibility with other decisions.&#10;&#10;On the downside, adding a specific feature for only one decision may increase complexity, as it requires separate code maintenance and testing. This approach might also lead to redundancies if similar decisions require similar features in the future. Additionally, it could make the overall system less cohesive and more difficult to understand or modify.&#10;&#10;When making such a choice, some intermediate things and necessary features worth computing include:&#10;&#10;1. Compatibility with existing components: Ensure that the new feature doesn't create conflicts or inconsistencies with the rest of the system.&#10;2. Scalability: Consider whether the added feature can handle increased data loads or growing complexity as the system evolves.&#10;3. Modularity: Implement the new feature in a way that allows for easy integration with other decisions if needed, promoting reusability and reducing code duplication.&#10;4. Performance: Assess the computational resources required by the new feature and ensure it doesn't negatively impact the overall system performance.&#10;5. Usability: Make sure that the added feature is user-friendly and consistent with the rest of the interface, minimizing cognitive load for users.&#10;6. Documentation: Thoroughly document the new feature, including its purpose, implementation details, and any limitations or assumptions, to facilitate future maintenance and development." />
    <node id="1. The issue with computation, as mentioned by Professor B, revolves around the presence of loops in the decision-making process, which may cause problems such as non-convergence or infinite loops. This situation makes it difficult to compute and reach a definitive outcome.&#10;2. To address this problem, Professor B suggests breaking up the computation into smaller parts or sub-problems, avoiding creating long chains of connections or loops between different decisions. By doing so, the overall decision-making process can be made more manageable, efficient, and easier to compute." />

    <node id="The size of the CPT in this case would be 4^4, which equals 256.

Accessibility is different from commercial landmarks in relation to temporal variations because accessibility varies temporally. This means that a place can be accessible at one point in time and not accessible at another point in time, while commercial landmarks typically do not have this temporal variation in their classification.

    <node id="When determining the most appropriate time to query if a user will need more film, one should consider the following factors and aspects based on the given transcript:&#10;&#10;1. User model: Analyze the user's interests and behaviors as represented by the vector of ones and zeros in the user model. This information can help you predict whether the user is likely to need more film soon. For example, if the user has shown interest in many photography-related activities, they might be more likely to need additional film.&#10;2. Situation model: Take into account the current situation of the user as derived from the situation model. This includes external factors that may influence the user's decisions or needs, such as a strike that could prevent them from going to a location where they would typically buy more film.&#10;3. Discourse model: Consider the flow and context of the conversation with the user when deciding the best time to ask about their need for more film. You want to avoid interrupting the conversation unnecessarily or making the process of querying overly complex.&#10;4. Data-driven insights: Utilize available data about user intentions, preferences, and behaviors to inform your decision on the most appropriate time to query. This may include information about how thrifty the user is, which could influence their film purchasing habits.&#10;5. Direct observations from interaction: Pay attention to the user's utterances and actions during the conversation, as they can provide clues about their potential need for more film. For example, if they frequently mention running out of film or express frustration with their current supply, it might be an appropriate time to ask if they need more.&#10;6. Minimizing assumptions: When formulating questions associated with decision nodes, avoid making too many conditional assumptions based on specific situations. Instead, focus on asking clear and direct questions that are likely to yield useful information for determining the user's needs." />

    <node id="The &quot;mixture of experts&quot; is a concept used to determine which expert to trust in a given situation by using a hidden variable (H) that decides which of the experts is most reliable based on the input values. In this implementation, the H variable evaluates the input data from X-1, X-2, X-3, and X-4 and selects the most appropriate expert accordingly. The selection process can be predefined or learned from training data, requiring data with people's intentions to properly determine the best course of action. This approach allows for a more adaptable and reliable decision-making process by evaluating the input data and selecting the most appropriate expert based on their reliability in specific situations." />

    <node id="One way to handle the issue discussed by Professors B and E, apart from ignoring it, is to create an intermediate node between the user and the endpoint decision.

By doing this, it would avoid having a long, messy link between the user and the endpoint decision and make it easier to compute compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user.

The computation is not well-defined because having loops creates ambiguity in the decision-making process. If there are loops, it may not be clear how to proceed, leading to situations where things do not converge (issue 2).&#10;3.

User model: Analyze the user's interests and behaviors as represented by the vector of ones and zeros in the user model. This information can help you predict whether the user is likely to need more film soon. For example, if the user has shown interest in many photography-related activities, they might be more likely to need additional film.&#10;2.

This includes external factors that may influence the user's decisions or needs, such as a strike that could prevent them from going to a location where they would typically buy more film.&#10;3. Discourse model: Consider the flow and context of the conversation with the user when deciding the best time to ask about their need for more film. You want to avoid interrupting the conversation unnecessarily or making the process of querying overly complex.&#10;4. Data-driven insights: Utilize available data about user intentions, preferences, and behaviors to inform your decision on the most appropriate time to query. This may include information about how thrifty the user is, which could influence their film purchasing habits.&#10;5. Direct observations from interaction: Pay attention to the user's utterances and actions during the conversation, as they can provide clues about their potential need for more film. For example, if they frequently mention running out of film or express frustration with their current supply, it might be an appropriate time to ask if they need more.&#10;6. Minimizing assumptions: When formulating questions associated with decision nodes, avoid making too many conditional assumptions based on specific situations.

Direct observations from interaction: Pay attention to the user's utterances and actions during the conversation, as they can provide clues about their potential need for more film.

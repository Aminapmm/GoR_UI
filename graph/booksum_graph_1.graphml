    <node id=" The treaty referred to is a historical reference to the way early European settlers, in this case the Dutch, would make agreements with certain Native American groups in order to secure land for themselves. In this particular situation, the Delawares and Mohicans were disarmed and their rights to their ancestral lands were affected. However, the Mohicans did not participate in this treaty and kept their weapons, as they had to deal with the English. The Delawares initially went along with the treaty but later realized it was a mistake. This treaty is portrayed as being detrimental to the Native American groups and allowing for the European settlers to take over their land. It's also shown that the natives who kept their weapons and didn't enter into this treaty were better off in the long run. The scout in the narrative is a descendant of one of the Mohican sagamores, and he tells the story of how his family used to have vast tracts of land but now are left with only six feet of earth." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;I had thought the Delawares a pacific people,&quot; said Duncan, &quot;and that&#10;they never waged war in person; trusting the defence of their lands to&#10;those very Mohawks that you slew!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis true in part,&quot; returned the scout, &quot;and yet, at the bottom, 'tis a&#10;wicked lie. Such a treaty was made in ages gone by, through the&#10;deviltries of the Dutchers, who wished to disarm the natives that had&#10;the best right to the country where they had settled themselves. The&#10;Mohicans, though a part of the same nation, having to deal with the&#10;English, never entered into the silly bargain, but kept to their&#10;manhood; as in truth did the Delawares, when their eyes were opened to&#10;their folly. You see before you a chief of the great Mohican Sagamores!&#10;Once his family could chase their deer over tracts of country wider than&#10;that which belongs to the Albany Patteroon, without crossing brook or&#10;hill that was not their own; but what is left to their descendant!

I was then a younker, and&#10;went out with the Delawares, because I know'd they were a scandalized&#10;and wronged race. Forty days and forty nights did the imps crave our&#10;blood around this pile of logs, which I designed and partly reared,&#10;being, as you'll remember, no Indian myself, but a man without a cross.&#10;The Delawares lent themselves to the work, and we made it good, ten to&#10;twenty, until our numbers were nearly equal, and then we sallied out&#10;upon the hounds, and not a man of them ever got back to tell the fate of&#10;his party.

Just&#10;hereaway, where you see the trees rise into a mountain swell, I met a&#10;party coming down to our aid, and I led them where the enemy were taking&#10;their meal, little dreaming that they had not finished the bloody work&#10;of the day.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you surprised them?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If death can be a surprise to men who are thinking only of the cravings&#10;of their appetites. We gave them but little breathing time, for they had&#10;borne hard upon us in the fight of the morning, and there were few in&#10;our party who had not lost friend or relative by their hands. When all&#10;was over, the dead, and some say the dying, were cast into that little&#10;pond. These eyes have seen its waters colored with blood, as natural&#10;water never yet flowed from the bowels of the 'arth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was a convenient, and, I trust, will prove a peaceful grave for a&#10;soldier.

And of&#10;all those who aided in placing them where they lie, Chingachgook and I&#10;only are living! The brothers and family of the Mohican formed our&#10;war-party; and you see before you all that are now left of his race.&quot;&#10;&#10;The eyes of the listeners involuntarily sought the forms of the Indians,&#10;with a compassionate interest in their desolate fortune. The dark&#10;persons were still to be seen within the shadows of the block-house, the&#10;son listening to the relation of his father with that sort of&#10;intenseness which would be created by a narrative that redounded so much&#10;to the honor of those whose names he had long revered for their courage&#10;and savage virtues.&#10;&#10;&quot;I had thought the Delawares a pacific people,&quot; said Duncan, &quot;and that&#10;they never waged war in person; trusting the defence" />

Ay! these Frenchers&#10;will pull it to pieces faster than it was put together, solid and thick&#10;though it be.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heyward, I sicken at the sight of danger that I cannot share,&quot; said the&#10;undaunted, but anxious daughter. &quot;Let us go to Montcalm, and demand&#10;admission: he dare not deny a child the boon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You would scarce find the tent of the Frenchman with the hair on your&#10;head,&quot; said the blunt scout. &quot;If I had but one of the thousand boats&#10;which lie empty along that shore, it might be done.

Poor and old as it is, it&#10;offers a cover, and has rung with the crack of a rifle afore to-night!&quot;&#10;&#10;He was instantly obeyed, the Mohicans leading the Narragansetts within&#10;the ruin, whither the whole party repaired with the most guarded&#10;silence.&#10;&#10;The sounds of approaching footsteps were now too distinctly audible to&#10;leave any doubts as to the nature of the interruption. They were soon&#10;mingled with voices calling to each other in an Indian dialect, which&#10;the hunter, in a whisper, affirmed to Heyward was the language of the&#10;Hurons. When the party reached the point where the horses had entered&#10;the thicket which surrounded the block-house, they were evidently at&#10;fault, having lost those marks which, until that moment, had directed&#10;their pursuit.&#10;&#10;It would seem by the voices that twenty" />

As for the grave, there,&#10;being as quiet as you mention, it is another matter. There are them in&#10;the camp who say and think, man, to lie still, should not be buried&#10;while the breath is in the body; and certain it is that in the hurry of&#10;that evening, the doctors had but little time to say who was living and&#10;who was dead. Hist! see you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis not probable that any are as houseless as ourselves, in this&#10;dreary forest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Such as he may care but little for house or shelter, and night dew can&#10;never wet a body that passes its days in the water,&quot; returned the scout,&#10;grasp" />
    <node id=" the beasts of&#10;the fields! Our night, however, will soon be over; for, with the moon,&#10;we must be up and moving again. I remember to have fou't the Maquas,&#10;hereaways, in the first war in which I ever drew blood from man; and we&#10;threw up a work of blocks, to keep the ravenous varmints from handling&#10;our scalps. If my marks do not fail me, we shall find the place a few&#10;rods farther to our left.&quot;&#10;&#10;Without waiting for an assent, or, indeed, for any reply, the sturdy&#10;hunter moved boldly into a dense thicket of young chestnuts, shoving&#10;aside the branches of the exuberant shoots which nearly covered the&#10;ground, like a man who expected, at each step, to discover some object&#10;he had formerly known. The recollection of the scout did not deceive&#10;him. After penetrating through the brush, matted as it was with briers,&#10;for a few hundred feet he entered an open space, that surrounded a low,&#10;green hillock, which was crowned by the decayed block-house in question.&#10;This rude and neglected building was one of those deserted works," />
    <node id="&#10;Duncan was awakened from his slumber by a light tap on the shoulder from Chingachgook. According to Chingachgook, the moon has come and the white man's fort is far away, so it is time for them to move, especially since the Frenchmen are still potentially a threat." />
    <node id=" proof of devotion and watchfulness.&#10;&#10;How long the tired Duncan lay in this insensible state he never knew&#10;himself, but his slumbering visions had been long lost in total&#10;forgetfulness, when he was awakened by a light tap on the shoulder.&#10;Aroused by this signal, slight as it was, he sprang upon his feet with a&#10;confused recollection of the self-imposed duty he had assumed with the&#10;commencement of the night.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who comes?&quot; he demanded, feeling for his sword at the place where it&#10;was usually suspended, &quot;Speak! friend or enemy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Friend,&quot; replied the low voice of Chingachgook; who, pointing upwards&#10;at the luminary which was shedding its mild light through the opening in&#10;the trees, directly in their bivouac, immediately added, in his rude&#10;English, &quot;moon comes, and white man's fort far--far off; time to move,&#10;when sleep shuts both eyes of the Frenchman!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You say true! call up your friends, and bridle the horses, while I&#10;prepare my own companions for the march!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We are awake, Duncan,&quot; said the soft" />

Go,&#10;then, and sleep; believe me, neither of us, weak girls as we are, will&#10;betray our watch.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young man was relieved from the awkwardness of making any further&#10;protestations of his own demerits, by an exclamation from Chingachgook,&#10;and the attitude of riveted attention assumed by his son.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Mohicans hear an enemy!&quot; whispered Hawkeye, who, by this time, in&#10;common with the whole party, was awake and stirring. &quot;They scent danger&#10;in the" />
    <node id=" by their toilsome march.&#10;Unwilling to prolong a useless discussion, the young man affected to&#10;comply, by posting his back against the logs of the block-house, in a&#10;half-recumbent posture, though resolutely determined, in his own mind,&#10;not to close an eye until he had delivered his precious charge into the&#10;arms of Munro himself. Hawkeye, believing he had prevailed, soon fell&#10;asleep, and a silence as deep as the solitude in which they had found&#10;it, pervaded the retired spot.&#10;&#10;For many minutes Duncan succeeded in keeping his senses on the alert,&#10;and alive to every moaning sound that arose from the forest. His vision&#10;became more acute as the shades of evening settled on the place; and&#10;even after the stars were glimmering above his head, he was able to&#10;distinguish the recumbent forms of his companions, as they lay stretched&#10;on the grass, and to note the person of Chingachgook, who sat upright&#10;and motionless as one of the trees which formed the dark barrier on&#10;every side. He still heard the gentle breathings of the sisters, who lay&#10;within a few feet of him" />

They then retired within the walls,&#10;and first offering up their thanksgivings for past mercies, and&#10;petitioning for a continuance of the divine favor throughout the coming&#10;night, they laid their tender forms on the fragrant couch, and in spite&#10;of recollections and forebodings, soon sank into those slumbers which&#10;nature so imperiously demanded, and which were sweetened by hopes for&#10;the morrow. Duncan had prepared himself to pass the night in&#10;watchfulness near them, just without the ruin, but the scout, perceiving&#10;his intention, pointed towards Chingachgook, as he coolly disposed his&#10;own person on the grass, and said--&#10;&#10;&quot;The eyes of a white man are too heavy and too blind for such a watch as&#10;this! The Mohican will be our sentinel, therefore let us sleep.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I proved myself a sluggard on my post during the past night,&quot; said&#10;Heyward, &quot;and have less need of repose than you, who did more credit to&#10;the" />
    <node id=" edifice. While Heyward and his companions hesitated to approach a&#10;building so decayed, Hawkeye and the Indians entered within the low&#10;walls, not only without fear, but with obvious interest. While the&#10;former surveyed the ruins, both internally and externally, with the&#10;curiosity of one whose recollections were reviving at each moment,&#10;Chingachgook related to his son, in the language of the Delawares, and&#10;with the pride of a conqueror, the brief history of the skirmish which&#10;had been fought, in his youth, in that secluded spot. A strain of&#10;melancholy, however, blended with his triumph, rendering his voice, as&#10;usual, soft and musical.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, the sisters gladly dismounted, and prepared to enjoy&#10;their halt in the coolness of the evening, and in a security which they&#10;believed nothing but the beasts of the forest could invade.&#10;&#10;&quot;Would not our resting-place have been more retired, my worthy friend,&quot;&#10;demanded the more vigilant Duncan, perceiving that the scout had already&#10;finished his short survey, &quot;had we chosen a spot less known, and one&#10;more rarely visited than this?&quot;&#10;" />

He still heard the gentle breathings of the sisters, who lay&#10;within a few feet of him, and not a leaf was ruffled by the passing air,&#10;of which his ear did not detect the whispering sound. At length,&#10;however, the mournful notes of a whippoorwill became blended with the&#10;moanings of an owl; his heavy eyes occasionally sought the bright rays&#10;of the stars, and then he fancied he saw them through the fallen lids.&#10;At instants of momentary wakefulness he mistook a bush for his associate&#10;sentinel; his head next sank upon his shoulder, which, in its turn,&#10;sought the support of the ground; and, finally, his whole person become&#10;relaxed and pliant, and the young man sank into a deep sleep, dreaming&#10;that he was a knight of ancient chivalry, holding his midnight vigils&#10;before the tent of a recaptured princess, whose favor he did not despair&#10;of gaining, by such a proof of devotion and watchfulness.&#10;&#10;How long the tired Duncan lay in this insensible state he never knew&#10;himself, but his slumbering" />
    <node id=" The person who shouted &quot;Point de quartier aux coquins&quot; and &quot;Stand firm, and be ready, my gallant 60ths&quot; is an officer from the British army, most likely a commanding officer given his authority in ordering the soldiers. This is evident when he is referred to as being above them and addressing his troops. The piercing cry from within the mist is Alice's voice calling out for her father, Lieutenant-General Munro, identifying herself and pleading for his and Heyward's lives, shouting &quot;it is I! Alice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!&quot; This serves as a critical moment in the narrative, leading to their successful escape." />
    <node id=", the fog&#10;rolled upwards in thick wreaths, and several cannon belched across the&#10;plain, and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bellowing echoes of&#10;the mountain.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis from the fort!&quot; exclaimed Hawkeye, turning short on his tracks;&#10;&quot;and we, like stricken fools, were rushing to the woods, under the very&#10;knives of the Maquas.&quot;&#10;&#10;The instant their mistake was rectified, the whole party retraced the&#10;error with the utmost diligence. Duncan willingly relinquished the&#10;support of Cora to the arm of Uncas, and Cora as readily accepted the&#10;welcome assistance. Men, hot and angry in pursuit, were evidently on&#10;their footsteps, and each instant threatened their capture, if not their&#10;destruction.&#10;&#10;&quot;Point de quartier aux coquins!&quot; cried an eager pursuer, who seemed to&#10;direct the operations of the enemy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stand firm, and be ready, my gallant 60ths!&quot; suddenly exclaimed a voice&#10;above them; &quot;wait to see the enemy,--fire low, and sweep the glacis.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Father! father!&quot; exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist; &quot;it is" />

Stand to your&#10;arms, my friends; for we know not whom we encounter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Qui vive?&quot; demanded a stern, quick voice, which sounded like a&#10;challenge from another world, issuing out of that solitary and solemn&#10;place.&#10;&#10;&quot;What says it?&quot; whispered the scout; &quot;it speaks neither Indian nor&#10;English!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Qui vive?&quot; repeated the same voice, which was quickly followed by the&#10;rattling of arms, and a menacing attitude.&#10;&#10;&quot;France!&quot; cried Heyward, advancing from the shadow of the trees to the&#10;shore of the pond, within a few yards of the sentinel.&#10;&#10;&quot;D'ou venez-vous--ou allez-vous, d'aussi bonne heure?&quot; demanded the&#10;grenadier" />

God has restored me my children! Throw open the&#10;sally-port; to the field, 60ths, to the field; pull not a trigger, lest&#10;ye kill my lambs! Drive off these dogs of France with your steel.&quot;&#10;&#10;Duncan heard the grating of the rusty hinges, and darting to the spot,&#10;directed by the sound, he met a long line of dark red warriors, passing&#10;swiftly towards the glacis. He knew them for his own battalion of the&#10;royal Americans, and flying to their head, soon swept every trace of his&#10;pursuers from before the works.&#10;&#10;For an instant, Cora and Alice had stood trembling and bewildered by&#10;this unexpected desertion; but, before either had leisure for speech, or&#10;" />

    <node id=" feu!&quot;&#10;&#10;The order was instantly obeyed, and the fog was stirred by the explosion&#10;of fifty muskets. Happily, the aim was bad, and the bullets cut the air&#10;in a direction a little different from that taken by the fugitives;&#10;though still so nigh them, that to the unpractised ears of David and the&#10;two females, it appeared as if they whistled within a few inches of the&#10;organs. The outcry was renewed, and the order, not only to fire again,&#10;but to pursue, was too plainly audible. When Heyward briefly explained&#10;the meaning of the words they heard, Hawkeye halted, and spoke with&#10;quick decision and great firmness.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us deliver our fire,&quot; he said; &quot;they will believe it a sortie, and&#10;give way, or they will wait for reinforcements.&quot;&#10;&#10;The scheme was well conceived, but failed in its effect. The instant the&#10;French heard the pieces, it seemed as if the plain was alive with men,&#10;muskets rattling along its whole extent, from the shores of the lake to&#10;the farthest boundary of the woods.&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall draw their entire army upon us," />
    <node id=" The scout, Hawkeye, tells Heyward that his judgment would be like the folly of a child and his vigilance wasted if he tried to keep watch in the darkness and wilderness, as opposed to Uncas who could skillfully navigate such conditions. He says this because they are in a thicket in the woods, and Hawkeye believes that his experience with the wilderness would be more effective in keeping them safe than standing guard. Heyward initially resists this idea, suggesting they make a detour around any danger, but eventually acquiesces and lies down to rest." />

Let all the party seek their rest, then,&#10;while I hold guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If we lay among the white tents of the 60th, and in front of an enemy&#10;like the French, I could not ask for a better watchman,&quot; returned the&#10;scout; &quot;but in the darkness and among the signs of the wilderness your&#10;judgment would be like the folly of a child, and your vigilance thrown&#10;away. Do then, like Uncas and myself, sleep, and sleep in safety.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward perceived, in truth, that the younger Indian had thrown his form&#10;on the side of the hillock while they were talking, like one who sought&#10;to make the most of the time allotted to rest, and that his example had&#10;been followed by David, whose voice literally &quot;clove to his jaws,&quot; with&#10;the fever of his wound, heightened, as it was, by their toilsome march.&#10;Unwilling to prolong a useless discussion, the young man affected to&#10;comply, by posting his back against the" />

The mists of Horican are not like the&#10;curls from a peace-pipe, or the smoke which settles above a mosquito&#10;fire.&quot;&#10;&#10;He was yet speaking, when a crashing sound was heard, and a cannon-ball&#10;entered the thicket, striking the body of a sapling, and rebounding to&#10;the earth, its force being much expended by previous resistance. The&#10;Indians followed instantly like busy attendants on the terrible&#10;messenger, and Uncas commenced speaking earnestly and with much action,&#10;in the Delaware tongue.&#10;&#10;&quot;It may be so, lad,&quot; muttered the scout, when he had ended; &quot;for&#10;desperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache. Come, then, the&#10;fog is shutting in.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Heyward; &quot;first explain your expectations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis soon done" />
    <node id=" from the low and&#10;devious water-course to rise again to the light and level of the sandy&#10;but wooded plain. Here the scout seemed to be once more at home, for he&#10;held on his way with the certainty and diligence of a man who moved in&#10;the security of his own knowledge. The path soon became more uneven, and&#10;the travellers could plainly perceive that the mountains drew nigher to&#10;them on each hand, and that they were, in truth, about entering one of&#10;their gorges. Suddenly, Hawkeye made a pause, and waiting until he was&#10;joined by the whole party, he spoke, though in tones so low and&#10;cautious, that they added to the solemnity of his words, in the quiet&#10;and darkness of the place.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is easy to know the pathways, and to find the licks and&#10;water-courses of the wilderness,&quot; he said; &quot;but who that saw this spot&#10;could venture to say, that a mighty army was at rest among yonder silent&#10;trees and barren mountains?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We are then at no great distance from William Henry?&quot; said Heyward,&#10;advancing nigher to the scout.&#10;&#10;&quot;It" />
    <node id=" which the scout also showed to&#10;Heyward, as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction.&#10;&#10;But the spectacle which most concerned the young soldier was on the&#10;western bank of the lake, though quite near to its southern termination.&#10;On a strip of land, which appeared, from his stand, too narrow to&#10;contain such an army, but which, in truth, extended many hundreds of&#10;yards from the shores of the Horican to the base of the mountain, were&#10;to be seen the white tents and military engines of an encampment of ten&#10;thousand men. Batteries were already thrown up in their front, and even&#10;while the spectators above them were looking down, with such different&#10;emotions, on a scene which lay like a map beneath their feet, the roar&#10;of artillery rose from the valley, and passed off in thundering echoes,&#10;along the eastern hills.&#10;&#10;&quot;Morning is just touching them below,&quot; said the deliberate and musing&#10;scout, &quot;and the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by the&#10;sound of cannon. We are a few hours too late? Montcalm has already&#10;filled the woods with his accursed Iroquois.&quot;" />
    <node id=" again turned towards those who just then interested&#10;him more. He heard the two Hurons leave the bushes, and it was soon&#10;plain that all the pursuers were gathered about them, in deep attention&#10;to their report. After a few minutes of earnest and solemn dialogue,&#10;altogether different from the noisy clamor with which they had first&#10;collected about the spot, the sounds grew fainter and more distant, and&#10;finally were lost in the depths of the forest.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye waited until a signal from the listening Chingachgook assured&#10;him that every sound from the retiring party was completely swallowed by&#10;the distance, when he motioned to Heyward to lead forth the horses, and&#10;to assist the sisters into their saddles. The instant this was done,&#10;they issued through the broken gateway, and stealing out by a direction&#10;opposite to the one by which they had entered, they quitted the spot,&#10;the sisters casting furtive glances at the silent grave and crumbling&#10;ruin, as they left the soft light of the moon, to bury themselves in the&#10;gloom of the woods.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;  &quot;_Guard._--Qui est la?&#10;&#10;  _Puc._--" />
    <node id=" The sentinel challenged Heyward and the scout by saying &quot;Qui vive?&quot; which means &quot;Who goes there?&quot; in French. Heyward responded by saying &quot;France!&quot; to indicate their peaceful intentions." />
    <node id="!&quot; whispered the scout, when they had&#10;gained a little distance from the place, and letting his rifle fall into&#10;the hollow of his arm again; &quot;I soon saw that he was one of them uneasy&#10;Frenchers; and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his&#10;wishes kind, or a place might have been found for his bones among those&#10;of his countrymen.&quot;&#10;&#10;He was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little&#10;basin, as though, in truth, the spirits of the departed lingered about&#10;their watery sepulchre.&#10;&#10;&quot;Surely it was of flesh!&quot; continued the scout; &quot;no spirit could handle&#10;its arms so steadily!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It _was_ of flesh; but whether the poor fellow still belongs to this&#10;world may well be doubted,&quot; said Heyward, glancing his eyes around him,&#10;and missing Chingachgook from their little band. Another groan more&#10;faint than the former, was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into&#10;the water, and all was as still again as if the borders of the dreary&#10;pool had never been awakened from the silence of creation." />
    <node id="&#10;Montcalm's pay would be thrown off the scent, for months to come.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let it be done, and that instantly.&quot;&#10;&#10;Further words were unnecessary; for Hawkeye, merely uttering the mandate&#10;to &quot;follow,&quot; moved along the route by which they had just entered their&#10;present critical and even dangerous situation. Their progress, like&#10;their late dialogue, was guarded, and without noise; for none knew at&#10;what moment a passing patrol, or a crouching picket of the enemy, might&#10;rise upon their path. As they held their silent way along the margin of&#10;the pond, again Heyward and the scout stole furtive glances at its&#10;appalling dreariness. They looked in vain for the form they had so&#10;recently seen stalking along its silent shores, while a low and regular&#10;wash of the little waves, by announcing that the waters were not yet&#10;subsided, furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they had&#10;just witnessed. Like all that passing and gloomy scene, the low basin,&#10;however, quickly melted in the darkness, and became blended with the&#10;mass of black objects in the rear of the travellers.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye soon deviated from" />

    <node id=" In this passage, Hawkeye determines the direction in which they should lead their army based on the trail of a cannonball by examining the furrow it created when it hit the ground.

In vain he turned&#10;either cheek towards the light air; they felt equally cool. In this&#10;dilemma, Uncas lighted on the furrow of the cannon-ball, where it had&#10;cut the ground in three adjacent ant-hills.&#10;&#10;&quot;Give me the range!&quot; said Hawkeye, bending to catch a glimpse of the&#10;direction, and then instantly moving onward.&#10;&#10;Cries, oaths, voices calling to each other, and the reports of muskets,&#10;were now quick and incessant, and, apparently, on every side of them.&#10;Suddenly, a strong glare of light flashed across the scene, the fog&#10;rolled upwards in thick wreaths, and several cannon belched across the&#10;plain, and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bell" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We are then at no great distance from William Henry?&quot; said Heyward,&#10;advancing nigher to the scout.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is yet a long and weary path, and when and where to strike it, is&#10;now our greatest difficulty. See,&quot; he said, pointing through the trees&#10;towards a spot where a little basin of water reflected the stars from&#10;its placid bosom, &quot;here is the 'bloody pond'; and I am on the ground&#10;that I have not only often travelled, but over which I have fou't the&#10;enemy, from the rising to the setting sun.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ha! that sheet of dull and dreary water, then, is the sepulchre of the&#10;brave men who fell in the contest. I have heard it named, but never have&#10;I stood on its banks before.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Three battles did we make with the Dutch-Frenchman[20] in a day,&quot;&#10;continued Hawkeye, pursuing the train of his own thoughts, rather than&#10;replying to the remark of Duncan. &quot;He met us hard by, in our outward&#10;march to ambush his advance, and scattered us, like driven deer, through&#10;" />
    <node id=" then, the&#10;fog is shutting in.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Heyward; &quot;first explain your expectations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis soon done, and a small hope it is; but it is better than nothing.&#10;This shot that you see,&quot; added the scout, kicking the harmless iron with&#10;his foot, &quot;has ploughed the 'arth in its road from the fort, and we&#10;shall hunt for the furrow it has made, when all other signs may fail. No&#10;more words, but follow, or the fog may leave us in the middle of our&#10;path, a mark for both armies to shoot at.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward perceiving that, in fact, a crisis had arrived when acts were&#10;more required than words, placed himself between the sisters, and drew&#10;them swiftly forward, keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye.&#10;It was soon apparent that Hawkeye had not magnified the power of the&#10;fog, for before they had proceeded twenty yards, it was difficult for&#10;the different individuals of the party to distinguish each other, in the&#10;vapor.&#10;&#10;They had made their little circuit to the left, and were already&#10;inclining again towards the right, having" />

Heyward had previously admitted to falling asleep on guard duty the night before, which may have increased his willingness to accept Hawkeye's suggestion and get some rest." />
    <node id="&#09;Hawkeye and his followers took a route that led them towards the mountains forming the western boundary of the narrow plain. They traversed through rugged terrain with rocks, ravines, and bleak hills, which slowed their progress but also provided a sense of security. The path they took was winding and had been devised by men long practiced in the arts of the wilderness. They gradually climbed a steep and rugged ascent, and as they rose from the valleys, the thick darkness began to disperse, and objects were seen in plain and palpable colors. The terrain they traveled through was challenging, but Hawkeye's expertise and familiarity with the wilderness allowed them to navigate it successfully." />
    <node id=", quickly melted in the darkness, and became blended with the&#10;mass of black objects in the rear of the travellers.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat, and striking off&#10;towards the mountains which form the western boundary of the narrow&#10;plain, he led his followers, with swift steps, deep within the shadows&#10;that were cast from their high and broken summits. The route was now&#10;painful; lying over ground ragged with rocks, and intersected with&#10;ravines, and their progress proportionately slow. Bleak and black hills&#10;lay on every side of them, compensating in some degree for the&#10;additional toil of the march, by the sense of security they imparted. At&#10;length the party began slowly to climb a steep and rugged ascent by a&#10;path that curiously wound among rocks and trees, avoiding the one, and&#10;supported by the other, in a manner that showed it had been devised by&#10;men long practised in the arts of the wilderness. As they gradually rose&#10;from the level of the valleys, the thick darkness which usually precedes&#10;the approach of day began to disperse, and objects were seen in the&#10;plain and palpable colors with which they had been gifted" />
    <node id="&#10;  &quot;I'll seek a readier path.&quot;&#10;&#10;  PARNELL.&#10;&#10;&#10;The route taken by Hawkeye lay across those sandy plains, relieved by&#10;occasional valleys and swells of land, which had been traversed by their&#10;party on the morning of the same day, with the baffled Magua for their&#10;guide. The sun had now fallen low towards the distant mountains; and as&#10;their journey lay through the interminable forest, the heat was no&#10;longer oppressive. Their progress, in consequence, was proportionate;&#10;and long before the twilight gathered about them, they had made good&#10;many toilsome miles on their return.&#10;&#10;The hunter, like the savage whose place he filled, seemed to select&#10;among the blind signs of their wild route, with a species of instinct,&#10;seldom abating his speed, and never pausing to deliberate. A rapid and&#10;oblique glance at the moss on the trees, with an occasional upward gaze&#10;towards the setting sun, or a steady but passing look at the direction&#10;of the numerous water-courses, through which he waded, were sufficient&#10;to determine his path, and remove his greatest difficulties. In the&#10;meantime" />

However, the French soldiers seem suspicious and order Heyward to stop or they will make him an ally of the devil. They then fire their muskets at Heyward and his companions, but thankfully miss them." />
    <node id="The Mohicans, Uncas and Chingachgook, became alert and suspected the presence of an enemy while keeping vigil because they heard something in the logs. Hawkeye, who was also awake, confirmed their suspicion and told everyone to keep quiet and hide, as the smell of even a single kernel of brimstone would give away their position to the approaching enemies. They were waiting for the right moment to ambush the enemy, trusting in the experience of men who know the ways of the savages." />
    <node id=" in the logs; &quot;let us fire on their approach.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep everything in the shade,&quot; returned the scout; &quot;the snapping of a&#10;flint, or even the smell of a single karnel of the brimstone, would&#10;bring the hungry varlets upon us in a body. Should it please God that we&#10;must give battle for the scalps, trust to the experience of men who know&#10;the ways of the savages, and who are not often backward when the&#10;war-whoop is howled.&quot;&#10;&#10;Duncan cast his eyes behind him, and saw that the trembling sisters were&#10;cowering in the far corner of the building, while the Mohicans stood in&#10;the shadow, like two upright posts, ready, and apparently willing, to&#10;strike when the blow should be needed. Curbing his impatience, he again&#10;looked out upon the area, and awaited the result in silence. At that&#10;instant the thicket opened, and a tall and armed Huron advanced a few&#10;paces into the open space. As he gazed upon the silent block-house, the&#10;moon fell upon his swarthy countenance, and betrayed its surprise and&#10;curiosity. He made the exclamation which" />

The scout resumed his post&#10;in the advance, though his steps, after he had thrown a safe distance&#10;between himself and his enemies, were more deliberate than in their&#10;previous march, in consequence of his utter ignorance of the localities&#10;of the surrounding woods. More than once he halted to consult with his&#10;confederates, the Mohicans, pointing upwards at the moon, and examining&#10;the barks of the trees with care. In these brief pauses, Heyward and the&#10;sisters listened, with senses rendered doubly acute by the danger, to&#10;detect any symptoms which might announce the proximity of their foes. At&#10;such moments, it seemed as if a vast range of country lay buried in&#10;eternal sleep; not the least sound arising from the forest," />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Duncan Heyward plays a significant role in the battle against the French. Initially, he is part of an ambush aimed at the French advance, which successfully scatters them. Heyward distinguishes himself in this encounter, as it was his actions that led to the French retreat and the death of their leader, Dieskau.&#10;&#10;After the initial success, Heyward is then sent by Major Effingham, at Sir William's own bidding, on a mission to outflank the French and carry the news of their disaster across the portage to the fort on the Hudson. This further demonstrates his bravery and commitment to the battle.&#10;&#10;Heyward's role in repelling the French advance is crucial as it sets the stage for the larger battle. His subsequent mission to outflank the French and deliver the news of their defeat highlights his strategic importance and his ability to adapt to different combat situations.

Hundreds of Frenchmen saw the sun that day for the last&#10;time; and even the leader, Dieskau himself, fell into our hands so cut&#10;and torn with the lead, that he has gone back to his own country, unfit&#10;for further acts in war.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twas a noble repulse!&quot; exclaimed Heyward, in the heat of his youthful&#10;ardor; &quot;the fame of it reached us early, in our southern army.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay! but it did not end there.

    <node id=" The narrative is told from the perspective of Hawkeye, a skilled woodsman and scout. He was present when the Mohicans and Mohawks had their &quot;scrimmage&quot; as he was a young man at the time and had gone out with the Delawares, who were allies of the Mohicans. The conflict occurred during a war between the two tribes, and Hawkeye played a significant role in its outcome.&#10;&#10;He designed and partly reared the block-house, which was built as a fortification to protect the Delawares and Mohicans from the Mohawk warriors. Forty days and forty nights of fighting ensued, but the tide turned when their numbers became nearly equal, and they sallied out upon the Mohawks, killing them all.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye's account suggests that he played a crucial role in building the block-house and defending it during the conflict. He was likely a skilled fighter and tactician, which helped turn the tide of the battle in their favor. His experiences on the frontier gave him the knowledge needed to outsmart and defeat the enemy, ensuring the survival of his allies." />
    <node id="Heyward, his sister, and the scout were quickly moving through the woods, trying to put distance between themselves and their enemies. The scout took the lead, with Heyward and the sisters following behind. They were all on high alert, listening carefully for any signs of their pursuers. At one point, the scout stopped to consult with the Mohicans, Uncas and Chingachgook, pointing up at the moon and examining tree bark to get his bearings. Heyward and the sisters listened intently during these pauses, hoping to hear or detect any signs of the enemy nearby.&#10;&#10;Later, after stopping to wait for a fog to roll in and conceal their movements, the scout discovered that the enemy had posted a picket directly in their path. Heyward suggested they make a detour around the danger, but the narrative does not specify whether they did so or how they proceeded afterward.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that while the scout was consulted regarding their safety and potential dangers, there is no direct mention of him sharing any specific information about the enemy's location or military activity with Heyward during this part of their journey." />

In&#10;their eagerness, and favored by the nature of the ground, they had&#10;anticipated the fog, which was rolling heavily down the lake, and it&#10;became necessary to pause, until the mists had wrapped the camp of the&#10;enemy in their fleecy mantle. The Mohicans profited by the delay, to&#10;steal out of the woods, and to make a survey of surrounding objects.&#10;They were followed at a little distance by the scout, with a view to&#10;profit early by their report, and to obtain some faint knowledge for&#10;himself of the more immediate localities.&#10;&#10;In a very few moments he returned, his face reddened with vexation,&#10;while he muttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here has the cunning Frenchman been posting a picket directly in our&#10;path,&quot; he said; &quot;redskins and whites; and we shall be as likely to fall&#10;into their midst as to pass them in the fog!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger,&quot; asked Heyward, &quot;and come&#10;" />
    <node id=" The treaty referred to is an historical reference to how early European settlers, in this case the Dutch, made agreements with certain Native American groups, such as the Delawares, to secure land for themselves. In this particular situation, the Delawares were disarmed and their rights to their ancestral lands were affected. However, the Mohicans did not participate in this treaty and kept their weapons, as they had to deal with the English. The Delawares initially went along with the treaty but later realized it was a mistake. This treaty is portrayed as being detrimental to the Native American groups and allowing for the European settlers to take over their land. The scout in the narrative is a descendant of one of the Mohican sagamores, and he tells the story of how his family used to have vast tracts of land but now are left with only six feet of earth." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of traveling through the bed of a brook with no trail for nearly an hour was to evade potential pursuers by leaving no trace of their path. This strategy was suggested by Hawkeye, who recognized the importance of not leaving any signs that could lead their enemies to them.&#10;2. This technique made it difficult for the &quot;restless savages&quot; and other potential pursuers to follow the party's trail, as the water in the brook would wash away or obscure any footprints left behind.&#10;3. The brook provided a natural path with fewer obstacles compared to traveling through the forest, allowing them to move more quickly and quietly while maintaining a low profile. This increased their chances of successfully escaping from their pursuers." />

At&#10;such moments, it seemed as if a vast range of country lay buried in&#10;eternal sleep; not the least sound arising from the forest, unless it&#10;was the distant and scarcely audible rippling of a water-course. Birds,&#10;beasts, and man, appeared to slumber alike, if, indeed, any of the&#10;latter were to be found in that wide tract of wilderness. But the sounds&#10;of the rivulet, feeble and murmuring as they were, relieved the guides&#10;at once from no trifling embarrassment, and towards it they immediately&#10;held their way.&#10;&#10;When the banks of the little stream were gained, Hawkeye made another&#10;halt; and, taking the moccasins from his feet, he invited Heyward and&#10;Gamut to follow his example. He then entered the water, and for near an&#10;hour they travelled in the bed of the brook, leaving no trail. The moon&#10;had already sunk into an immense pile of black clouds, which lay&#10;impending above the western horizon, when they issued from the low and&#10;devious water-course to rise again to the light and level of the sandy&#10;but wooded plain.

After&#10;which, by the rustling of leaves, and cracking of dried twigs, it was&#10;apparent the savages were separating in pursuit of the lost trail.&#10;Fortunately for the pursued, the light of the moon, while it shed a&#10;flood of mild lustre upon the little area around the ruin, was not&#10;sufficiently strong to penetrate the deep arches of the forest, where&#10;the objects still lay in deceptive shadow. The search proved fruitless;&#10;for so short and sudden had been the passage from the faint path the&#10;travellers had journeyed into the thicket, that every trace of their&#10;footsteps was lost in the obscurity of the woods.&#10;&#10;It was not long, however, before the restless savages were heard beating&#10;the brush, and gradually approaching the inner edge of that dense border&#10;of young chestnuts which encircled the little area.&#10;&#10;&quot;They are coming,&quot; muttered Heyward, endeavoring to thrust his rifle&#10;through the chink in the logs; &quot;let us fire on their approach.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep everything in the shade,&quot; returned the scout; &quot;the snapping of a&#10;fl" />

The changing colors in the forest and the position of the sun and clouds were his cues for recognizing the arrival of night." />
    <node id=" numerous water-courses, through which he waded, were sufficient&#10;to determine his path, and remove his greatest difficulties. In the&#10;meantime, the forest began to change its hues, losing that lively green&#10;which had embellished its arches, in the graver light which is the usual&#10;precursor of the close of day.&#10;&#10;While the eyes of the sisters were endeavoring to catch glimpses through&#10;the trees, of the flood of golden glory which formed a glittering halo&#10;around the sun, tinging here and there with ruby streaks, or bordering&#10;with narrow edgings of shining yellow, a mass of clouds that lay piled&#10;at no great distance above the western hills, Hawkeye turned suddenly,&#10;and, pointing upwards towards the gorgeous heavens, he spoke:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Yonder is the signal given to a man to seek his food and natural rest,&quot;&#10;he said: &quot;better and wiser would it be, if he could understand the signs&#10;of nature, and take a lesson from the fowls of the air and the beasts of&#10;the fields! Our night, however, will soon be over; for, with the moon,&#10;we must be up and moving again." />
    <node id="1. The party, led by the scout, is quickly moving through the woods, trying to put distance between themselves and their enemies. They are all on high alert, listening carefully for any signs of their pursuers.&#10;2. The scout stops multiple times to consult with the Mohicans, Uncas and Chingachgook, pointing up at the moon and examining tree bark to get his bearings. Heyward and the sisters listen intently during these pauses as well.&#10;3. Later, after stopping for a fog to roll in and conceal their movements, the scout discovers that the enemy has posted a picket directly in their path. He suggests they make a detour around the danger, but it is not specified whether they do so or how they proceed afterward.&#10;4. The scout suggests traveling through a bed of a brook with no trail for nearly an hour to evade potential pursuers by leaving no trace of their path. This strategy is successful as the water in the brook washes away or obscures any footprints left behind.&#10;5. Eventually, the restless savages are heard beating the brush and gradually approaching the inner edge of a dense border of young chestnuts which encircled the little area where the party was hiding.&#10;6. Hawkeye, Heyward, and the others prepare to defend themselves when they hear low, distant sounds that startle them. However, it turns out to be some creature of the forest prowling around for food, not their enemies." />
    <node id=" enemy!&quot; whispered Hawkeye, who, by this time, in&#10;common with the whole party, was awake and stirring. &quot;They scent danger&#10;in the wind!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;God forbid!&quot; exclaimed Heyward. &quot;Surely we have had enough of&#10;bloodshed!&quot;&#10;&#10;While he spoke, however, the young soldier seized his rifle, and&#10;advancing towards the front, prepared to atone for his venial&#10;remissness, by freely exposing his life in defence of those he attended.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis some creature of the forest prowling around us in quest of food,&quot;&#10;he said, in a whisper, as soon as the low, and apparently distant&#10;sounds, which had startled the Mohicans, reached his own ears.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hist!&quot; returned the attentive scout; &quot;'tis man; even I can now tell his&#10;tread, poor as my senses are when compared to an Indian's! That&#10;scampering Huron has fallen in with one of Montcalm's outlying parties,&#10;and they have struck upon our trail. I shouldn't like, myself, to spill&#10;more human blood in this spot,&quot; he added, looking around with anxiety in&#10;his features, at the dim objects by" />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye indicates that they are not far from Fort William Henry, as made clear by his statement &quot;It would puzzle any man who was not born and bred in the woods to say, that a mighty army was at rest among yonder silent trees and barren mountains.&quot; He is certain of their location due to his extensive knowledge and experience with the wilderness, which allows him to understand and interpret signs from nature. The text mentions how he examines the trail of a cannonball and notices the changing colors in the forest and the position of the sun and clouds as cues for recognizing their proximity to the fort. However, there is no direct mention of Hawkeye presenting specific information about the enemy's location or military activity to Heyward." />
    <node id=" The groans and splash heard near the basin were caused by a living person, not the spirits of the dead Frenchmen. This is suggested when Duncan says &quot;Surely it was of flesh! no spirit could handle its arms so steadily!&quot; and Heyward adds that the person might not even belong to this world anymore after a heavy plunge into the water. Chingachgook's whereabouts are not explicitly stated in the text provided, but based on context, he likely left the group temporarily to investigate the source of the sound." />
    <node id="Based on the provided text, the question &quot;Who is there?&quot; was posed by a character named &quot;Guard&quot; and was answered by &quot;Puc.&quot; This dialogue occurs after Hawkeye, Heyward, and the sisters leave the scene, and it suggests that they are continuing their journey while the guard and Puc remain behind. The text does not provide any further information about the identities of &quot;Guard&quot; and &quot;Puc,&quot; or about their conversation." />
    <node id="1. The reason for the young man's relief from protesting his demerits is that he was feeling awkward about making any more excuses for his past mistakes, and this situation provided a natural break from that.&#10;2. The Mohicans, Uncas and Chingachgook, have caught attention of the party because they have heard an enemy, as they have sharper senses and are better at detecting danger than the others in the party." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of traveling through a brook in the wilderness was to evade potential pursuers by leaving no trace of their path, as the water would wash away or obscure any footprints left behind. This strategy also provided a natural path with fewer obstacles compared to traveling through the forest, allowing them to move more quickly and quietly while maintaining a low profile.&#10;2. There is no direct evidence in the text suggesting that this action helped Hawkeye, Heyward, and Gamut relieve their embarrassment. The narrative focus on this journey through the brook is about evading pursuers and not being tracked, rather than addressing any feelings of embarrassment." />
    <node id=" Yes, I was present during the battle between the Mohicans and Mohawks at the block-house. As a young man who is not an Indian, I played a significant role in this conflict. I designed and partly reared the block-house, which served as a crucial fortification for protecting our allies – the Delawares and Mohicans – from the attacking Mohawk warriors.&#10;&#10;For forty days and forty nights, we fought tirelessly against our enemies until their numbers became nearly equal to ours. At that point, we seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the Mohawks, ultimately killing them all. My experiences as a woodsman and scout on the frontier provided me with the necessary knowledge and skills to turn the tide of battle in our favor, ensuring the survival of my allies. This was a pivotal moment for the Delawares and Mohicans, who saw few survivors from their race after this battle." />
    <node id=" The sentinel said &quot;Qui vive?&quot; which means &quot;Who goes there?&quot; in French. Heyward responded by saying &quot;France!&quot; to indicate their peaceful intentions. This is based on the provided text, where it mentions that the sentinel challenged Heyward and the scout with &quot;Qui vive?&quot; and Heyward responded with &quot;France!&quot;. There is no direct evidence of the scout presenting any specific information about the enemy's location or their military activity. The relevant portion of the text focuses on Hawkeye's advice to Heyward regarding taking watch and resting, rather than discussing any details about the enemy's movements or activities." />
    <node id="In the text, Hawkeye doesn't explicitly refer to a specific signal for seeking food and natural rest. However, he suggests that people can learn from observing signs in nature, such as the changing colors in the forest and the position of the sun and clouds, which indicate the onset of night and the need to seek rest. He also implies that understanding the behavior of animals like fowls of the air and beasts of the fields can provide valuable lessons about recognizing natural cues for taking care of one's basic needs.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye himself uses his knowledge of nature to determine their proximity to Fort William Henry by examining the trail of a cannonball and noticing changes in the environment around him. He suggests that Heyward should rely on his experience and vigilance instead of trying to keep watch in the darkness, which would be like the folly of a child and a waste of effort.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no specific signal mentioned in the text, Hawkeye implies that people can learn from observing natural cues and using them to take care of their basic needs for food and rest." />

As a young man who is not an Indian, I played a significant role in this conflict. I designed and partly reared the block-house, which served as a crucial fortification for protecting our allies – the Delawares and Mohicans – from the attacking Mohawk warriors.&#10;&#10;For forty days and forty nights, we fought tirelessly against our enemies until their numbers became nearly equal to ours. At that point, we seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the Mohawks, ultimately killing them all. My experiences as a woodsman and scout on the frontier provided me with the necessary knowledge and skills to turn the tide of battle in our favor, ensuring the survival of my allies. This was a pivotal moment for the Delawares and Mohicans, who saw few survivors from their race after this battle.">

In this particular situation, the Delawares were disarmed and their rights to their ancestral lands were affected. However, the Mohicans did not participate in this treaty and kept their weapons, as they had to deal with the English. The Delawares initially went along with the treaty but later realized it was a mistake. This treaty is portrayed as being detrimental to the Native American groups and allowing for the European settlers to take over their land.

However, he suggests that people can learn from observing signs in nature, such as the changing colors in the forest and the position of the sun and clouds, which indicate the onset of night and the need to seek rest. He also implies that understanding the behavior of animals like fowls of the air and beasts of the fields can provide valuable lessons about recognizing natural cues for taking care of one's basic needs.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye himself uses his knowledge of nature to determine their proximity to Fort William Henry by examining the trail of a cannonball and noticing changes in the environment around him. He suggests that Heyward should rely on his experience and vigilance instead of trying to keep watch in the darkness, which would be like the folly of a child and a waste of effort.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no specific signal mentioned in the text, Hawkeye implies that people can learn from observing natural cues and using them to take care of their basic needs for food and rest.">

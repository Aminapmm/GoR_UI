    <node id="Miss Thorne, or Tess, realizes that many things will change in her life as she agrees to leave with Mr. Clare and establish a new identity together based on their future marriage and the proofs of her descent from Parson Tringham. She will no longer be a simple milkmaid but become Mrs. Clare, married to a gentleman and living a completely different life away from her family and current social circle. This realization brings about a mix of emotions in Tess - she is thrilled at the prospect of spending her life with Mr. Clare, who she deeply loves, and excited about starting anew; however, she also feels apprehensive about leaving behind everything she has ever known and the potential disapproval from society due to her past. Ultimately, Tess decides that the possibility of a happy future with Mr. Clare outweighs her fears, leading her to embrace this new chapter in her life wholeheartedly." />

And what had determined him?  Less the opportunity of an&#10;insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings&#10;were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its&#10;mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'Urberville&#10;family.  This was always how Clare settled practical questions; by&#10;a sentiment which had nothing to do with them.  They decided to go&#10;immediately after the wedding, and remain for a fortnight, instead&#10;of journeying to towns and inns.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of&#10;London that I have heard of,&quot; he said, &quot;and by March or April we will&#10;pay a visit to my father and mother.&quot;&#10;&#10;Questions of procedure such as these arose and passed, and the day,&#10;the incredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in&#10;the near future.

Apart from that,&#10;my future is to be totally foreign to my family--it will not affect&#10;even the surface of their lives.  We shall leave this part of&#10;England--perhaps England itself--and what does it matter how people&#10;regard us here?  You will like going, will you not?&quot;&#10;&#10;She could answer no more than a bare affirmative, so great was the&#10;emotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with&#10;him as his own familiar friend.  Her feelings almost filled her ears&#10;like a babble of waves, and surged up to her eyes.  She put her hand&#10;in his, and thus they went on, to a place where the reflected sun&#10;glared up from the river, under a bridge, with a molten-metallic glow&#10;that dazzled their eyes, though the sun itself was hidden by the&#10;bridge.  They stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered&#10;heads popped up from the smooth surface of the" />

How events&#10;were favouring her!&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't quite feel easy,&quot; she said to herself.  &quot;All this good&#10;fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill.  That's&#10;how Heaven mostly does.  I wish I could have had common banns!&quot;&#10;&#10;But everything went smoothly.  She wondered whether he would like her&#10;to be married in her present best white frock, or if she ought to&#10;buy a new one.  The question was set at rest by his forethought,&#10;disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her.&#10;Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to&#10;shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would well suit&#10;the simple wedding they planned.  He entered the house shortly after&#10;the arrival of the packages, and heard her upstairs undoing them.&#10;&#10;A minute later she came down with a flush on" />
    <node id=" when they took their walks together.&#10;&#10;The marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people&#10;in the church; had there been a thousand they would have produced&#10;no more effect upon her.  They were at stellar distances from her&#10;present world.  In the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her&#10;faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy.&#10;At a pause in the service, while they were kneeling together, she&#10;unconsciously inclined herself towards him, so that her shoulder&#10;touched his arm; she had been frightened by a passing thought, and&#10;the movement had been automatic, to assure herself that he was really&#10;there, and to fortify her belief that his fidelity would be proof&#10;against all things.&#10;&#10;Clare knew that she loved him--every curve of her form showed that--&#10;but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its&#10;single-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed,&#10;what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.&#10;&#10;As they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their&#10;rests, and a modest peal of three notes broke forth--" />

I want you&#10;to help me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be?  Why&#10;not a fortnight from now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; she said, becoming grave: &quot;I have so many things to think of&#10;first.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But--&quot;&#10;&#10;He drew her gently nearer to him.&#10;&#10;The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near.  Before&#10;discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round&#10;the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr&#10;Dairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids.&#10;&#10;Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet, while her&#10;face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight.&#10;&#10;&quot;I knew how it would be if I" />
    <node id=" could not;&#10;but there was another way.  She sat down and wrote on the four pages&#10;of a note-sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four&#10;years ago, put it into an envelope, and directed it to Clare.  Then,&#10;lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any&#10;shoes and slipped the note under his door.&#10;&#10;Her night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for&#10;the first faint noise overhead.  It came, as usual; he descended, as&#10;usual.  She descended.  He met her at the bottom of the stairs and&#10;kissed her. Surely it was as warmly as ever!&#10;&#10;He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought.  But he said not&#10;a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone.  Could&#10;he have had it?  Unless he began the subject she felt that she could&#10;say nothing.  So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever&#10;he thought he meant to keep to himself.  Yet he was frank and&#10;affectionate as before.  Could it be that her doubts were childish?&#10;that he forgave her" />
    <node id="Tess destroyed the letter she had written to Angel Clare because she realized that it was not the right time for him to read it. The household was in full bustle of preparation for their wedding, and with everyone coming and going, there was no opportunity for reflection or deliberate talk. Additionally, Tess knew that she could still tell him about her bygone trouble, as suggested by her mother in her response to Tess's letter. By destroying the letter, Tess avoided revealing her past to Angel before she was ready, allowing her to maintain some control over when and how he would learn about it." />

The carpet reached close to&#10;the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint&#10;white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him, which he&#10;obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it&#10;beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door.&#10;&#10;With a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter. There it&#10;was--sealed up, just as it had left her hands.  The mountain had&#10;not yet been removed.  She could not let him read it now, the house&#10;being in full bustle of preparation; and descending to her own room&#10;she destroyed the letter there.&#10;&#10;She was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious.&#10;The incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it&#10;prevented a confession; but she knew in her conscience that it need&#10;not; there was still time.  Yet everything was in a stir; there&#10;was coming and going; all had to dress, the dairyman and Mrs Crick&#10;having been asked to accompany them as witnesses; and reflection or&#10;deliberate talk was well-nigh impossible.  The only minute Tess could&#10;get" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very&#10;next day, and by the end of the week a response to her communication&#10;arrived in Joan Durbeyfield's wandering last-century hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;   DEAR TESS,--&#10;&#10;   J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well,&#10;   as they leave me at Present, thank God for it.

But with respect to your question,&#10;   Tess, J say between ourselves, quite private but very&#10;   strong, that on no account do you say a word of your&#10;   Bygone Trouble to him.  J did not tell everything&#10;   to your Father, he being so Proud on account of his&#10;   Respectability, which, perhaps, your Intended is&#10;   the same.  Many a woman--some of the Highest in the&#10;   Land--have had a Trouble in their time; and why should&#10;   you Trumpet yours when others don't Trumpet theirs?

    <node id=" married couple, and had followed them hither, being under&#10;injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs.  Clare&#10;brought it to the light.  It was less than a foot long, sewed up in&#10;canvas, sealed in red wax with his father's seal, and directed in his&#10;father's hand to &quot;Mrs Angel Clare.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,&quot; said he, handing it&#10;to her.  &quot;How thoughtful they are!&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess looked a little flustered as she took it.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think I would rather have you open it, dearest,&quot; said she, turning&#10;over the parcel.  &quot;I don't like to break those great seals; they look&#10;so serious.  Please open it for me!&quot;&#10;&#10;He undid the parcel.  Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the&#10;top of which lay a note and a key.&#10;&#10;The note was for Clare, in the following words:&#10;&#10;&#10;   MY DEAR SON--&#10;&#10;   Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your&#10;   godmother, Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad," />
    <node id=" murmured Retty Priddle.  &quot;I want to&#10;hate 'ee; but I cannot!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's how I feel,&quot; echoed Izz and Marian.  &quot;I can't hate her.&#10;Somehow she hinders me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He ought to marry one of you,&quot; murmured Tess.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are all better than I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We better than you?&quot; said the girls in a low, slow whisper.  &quot;No,&#10;no, dear Tess!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are!&quot; she contradicted impetuously.  And suddenly tearing away&#10;from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears,&#10;bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly,&#10;&quot;O yes, yes, yes!&quot;&#10;&#10;Having once given way she could not stop her weeping.&#10;&#10;&quot;He ought to have had one of you!&quot; she cried.  &quot;I think I ought to&#10;make him even now!  You would be better for him than--I don't know&#10;what I'm saying!  O!  O!&quot;&#10;&#10;They went up to her and clasped her round, but still her sobs tore&#10;her.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id=" here.  I wonder if you really love me,&#10;after all?&quot;&#10;&#10;He knew that she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she&#10;was surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal.&#10;Though she tried not to shed tears, she could not help showing one&#10;or two.&#10;&#10;&quot;I did not mean it!&quot; said he, sorry.  &quot;You are worried at not having&#10;your things, I know.  I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come&#10;with them.  Why, it is seven o'clock?  Ah, there he is!&quot;&#10;&#10;A knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer&#10;it, Clare went out.  He returned to the room with a small package in&#10;his hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not Jonathan, after all,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;How vexing!&quot; said Tess.&#10;&#10;The packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived&#10;at Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure&#10;of the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under&#10;injunction to deliver it into nobody's hands but theirs.  Clare&#10;brought it to" />
    <node id="&#10;hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized&#10;with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him, he&#10;could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge&#10;while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line.&#10;It was a pretty lover's dream, if no more.  Perhaps Tess's lineage&#10;had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.&#10;&#10;Her perception that Angel's bearing towards her still remained in no&#10;whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful&#10;if he could have received it.  She rose from breakfast before he had&#10;finished, and hastened upstairs.  It had occurred to her to look once&#10;more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare's den, or rather&#10;eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open&#10;door of the apartment, regarding and pondering.  She stooped to the&#10;threshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or&#10;three days earlier in such excitement.  The carpet reached close to&#10;the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint&#10;white margin of the envelope containing her" />
    <node id="When Tess and the other dairymaids learn that Tess's former sweetheart, Crick, is getting married, they are surprised and curious. They had noticed that Tess seemed different around Clare, but they did not know about their relationship. When Tess confirms that she is going to marry Clare, the girls become excited and happy for her. They gather around Tess, touching her and looking at her with admiration. Izz Huett even kisses Tess and calls her an &quot;angel.&quot; The girls express their support and excitement for Tess's upcoming marriage, while also acknowledging their previous feelings for Crick. However, they ultimately accept Tess's decision and are happy for her new beginning." />
    <node id=" going to be married soon,&quot; said Clare, with improvised&#10;phlegm.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah--and be ye!  Well, I am truly glad to hear it, sir.  I've&#10;thought you mid do such a thing for some time.  She's too good for a&#10;dairymaid--I said so the very first day I zid her--and a prize for&#10;any man; and what's more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman-farmer's&#10;wife; he won't be at the mercy of his baily wi' her at his side.&quot;&#10;&#10;Somehow Tess disappeared.  She had been even more struck with the&#10;look of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick's blunt&#10;praise.&#10;&#10;After supper, when she reached her bedroom, they were all present.  A&#10;light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed,&#10;awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts.&#10;&#10;But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood.&#10;They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to&#10;have.  Their condition was objective, contemplative.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" in their mood.&#10;They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to&#10;have.  Their condition was objective, contemplative.&#10;&#10;&quot;He's going to marry her!&quot; murmured Retty, never taking eyes off&#10;Tess.  &quot;How her face do show it!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You BE going to marry him?&quot; asked Marian.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tess.&#10;&#10;&quot;When?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Some day.&quot;&#10;&#10;They thought that this was evasiveness only.&#10;&#10;&quot;YES--going to MARRY him--a gentleman!&quot; repeated Izz Huett.&#10;&#10;And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another,&#10;crept out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess.&#10;Retty put her hands upon Tess's shoulders, as if to realize her&#10;friend's corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid&#10;their arms round her waist, all looking into her face.&#10;&#10;&quot;How it do seem!  Almost more than I can think of!&quot; said Izz Huett.&#10;&#10;Marian kissed Tess.  &quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured as she withdrew her lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was that because of love for" />

The dairyman, though&#10;he had thought of dismissing her soon, now made a great concern about&#10;losing her.  What should he do about his skimming?  Who would make&#10;the ornamental butter-pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies?&#10;Mrs Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last&#10;come to an end, and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she&#10;divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no&#10;common outdoor man; Tess had looked so superior as she walked" />
    <node id=".  Perhaps he had forgotten!  If so, there must be a week's&#10;postponement, and that was unlucky.  How could she remind her lover?&#10;She who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and&#10;alarm lest she should lose her dear prize.&#10;&#10;A natural incident relieved her anxiety.  Izz mentioned the omission&#10;of the banns to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron's privilege&#10;of speaking to Angel on the point.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have ye forgot 'em, Mr Clare?  The banns, I mean.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, I have not forgot 'em,&quot; says Clare.&#10;&#10;As soon as he caught Tess alone he assured her:&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't let them tease you about the banns.  A licence will be quieter&#10;for us, and I have decided on a licence without consulting you.&#10;So if you go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own&#10;name, if you wished to.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I didn't wish to hear it, dearest,&quot; she said proudly.&#10;&#10;But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess&#10;notwithstanding, who had well-" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it seems that there is some tension between Clare and the dairyman's wife. When they are all seated at the table, Clare notices that there is only one chair left, which is next to the dairyman's wife. He hesitates to sit there, but she insists, saying &quot;Do sit down by me, Mr Clare... I am sure you will find it more comfortable than against the wall.'' This makes Clare feel uncomfortable, and he notices that the dairymaids are watching them closely.&#10;&#10;After Clare sits down, the dairyman's wife tries to make conversation with him, asking him about his family and his occupation. However, Clare is not very responsive, and the conversation dies down quickly. The dairyman notices this tension between them and decides to intervene by saying ''I think we ought to be getting up, Mrs Crick.'' This breaks the awkward silence, and they all begin to move.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that the dairyman's wife may have been trying to flirt with Clare or make him feel uncomfortable, while the dairyman noticed this behavior and tried to defuse the situation by suggesting that they leave. This interaction suggests that there may be some tension or awkwardness between Clare and the dairy family, which may stem from the fact that he is marrying Tess and not one of the dairymaids." />
    <node id="&#10;succession where they stood, saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; to each as he did so.&#10;When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern&#10;the effect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her&#10;glance, as there might have been.  If there had it would have&#10;disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were.  The kiss had&#10;obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue.&#10;&#10;Of all this Clare was unconscious.  Passing on to the wicket-gate he&#10;shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and expressed his last&#10;thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment&#10;of silence before they had moved off.  It was interrupted by the&#10;crowing of a cock.  The white one with the rose comb had come and&#10;settled on the palings in front of the house, within a few yards of&#10;them, and his notes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like&#10;echoes down a valley of rocks.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh?&quot; said Mrs Crick.  &quot;An afternoon crow!&quot;&#10;&#10;Two men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.&#10;&#10;&quot;That" />

Since she had been at the dairy she&#10;had not once thought of the lines till now.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the&#10;wedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her&#10;company while there were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day,&#10;in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and&#10;greater day beaming close ahead of them.  During the preceding week,&#10;therefore, he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town,&#10;and they started together.&#10;&#10;Clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the&#10;world of his own class.  For months he had never gone near a town,&#10;and, requiring no vehicle, had never kept one, hiring the dairyman's&#10;" />
    <node id="Oh?&quot; said Mrs Crick.  &quot;An afternoon crow!&quot;&#10;&#10;Two men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's bad,&quot; one murmured to the other, not thinking that the words&#10;could be heard by the group at the door-wicket.&#10;&#10;The cock crew again--straight towards Clare.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well!&quot; said the dairyman.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't like to hear him!&quot; said Tess to her husband.  &quot;Tell the man&#10;to drive on.  Goodbye, goodbye!&quot;&#10;&#10;The cock crew again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hoosh!  Just you be off, sir, or I'll twist your neck!&quot; said the&#10;dairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him&#10;away.  And to his wife as they went indoors: &quot;Now, to think o' that&#10;just to-day!  I've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year&#10;afore.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It only means a change in the weather,&quot; said she; &quot;not what you&#10;think: 'tis impossible!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;They drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few&#10;miles, and, reaching Wellbridge" />

All the servantry of the dairy were&#10;standing in the red-brick entry to see them go out, the dairyman and&#10;his wife following to the door.  Tess saw her three chamber-mates&#10;in a row against the wall, pensively inclining their heads.  She&#10;had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment; but&#10;there they were, stoical and staunch to the last.  She knew why the&#10;delicate Retty looked so fragile, and Izz so tragically sorrowful,&#10;and Marian so blank; and she forgot her own dogging shadow for a&#10;moment in contemplating theirs.&#10;&#10;She impulsively whispered to him--&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you kiss 'em all, once, poor things, for the first and last&#10;time?&quot;&#10;&#10;Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality--which&#10;was all that it was to him--and as he passed them he kissed them in&#10;succession where they stood, saying &quot;Goodbye&quot; to each as he did so.&#10;When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern" />
    <node id=" on, and Clare,&#10;stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence.  But&#10;his opponent began to think better of the matter.  He looked anew at&#10;Tess as he passed her, and said to Clare--&#10;&#10;&quot;I beg pardon, sir; 'twas a complete mistake.  I thought she was&#10;another woman, forty miles from here.&quot;&#10;&#10;Clare, feeling then that he had been too hasty, and that he was,&#10;moreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an inn-passage, did&#10;what he usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to&#10;plaster the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific&#10;good night.  As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler,&#10;and the young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other&#10;direction.&#10;&#10;&quot;And was it a mistake?&quot; said the second one.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not a bit of it.  But I didn't want to hurt the gentleman's&#10;feelings--not I.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the meantime the lovers were driving onward.&#10;&#10;&quot;Could we put off our wedding till a little later?&quot;" />
    <node id="If Tess and her fiancé, Angel Clare, were to forget about the third call of the banns, which should take place two Sundays before their New Year's Eve wedding, it could result in a few potential consequences. In the narrative, Tess fears that if they forget to have the banns called for the third time, someone may stand up and forbid her marriage due to her past transgressions. This revelation of her history could potentially shame or embarrass her, leading to disappointment or distress.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for Tess, Izz Huett mentions the omission of the banns to Mrs. Crick, who assumes matronly privileges and speaks to Angel about it. To avoid any potential issues with the banns, Clare decides on a licence instead, which proves to be an immense relief for Tess. By choosing this route, they bypass the need for additional church calls of the banns and eliminate the risk of anyone challenging their union due to her past experiences." />
    <node id=" passed, and the day,&#10;the incredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in&#10;the near future.  The thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, was&#10;the date.  His wife, she said to herself.  Could it ever be?  Their&#10;two selves together, nothing to divide them, every incident shared&#10;by them; why not?  And yet why?&#10;&#10;One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and spoke&#10;privately to Tess.&#10;&#10;&quot;You was not called home this morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It should ha' been the first time of asking to-day,&quot; she answered,&#10;looking quietly at Tess.  &quot;You meant to be married New Year's Eve,&#10;deary?&quot;&#10;&#10;The other returned a quick affirmative.&#10;&#10;&quot;And there must be three times of asking.  And now there be only two&#10;Sundays left between.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess felt her cheek paling; Izz was right; of course there must be&#10;three.  Perhaps he had forgotten!  If so, there must be a week's&#10;postponement, and that was unlucky.  How could she remind" />

Calm yourself.  Do you mean that the fellow may have&#10;time to summon me for assault?&quot; he asked good-humouredly.&#10;&#10;&quot;No--I only meant--if it should have to be put off.&quot;&#10;&#10;What she meant was not very clear, and he directed her to dismiss&#10;such fancies from her mind, which she obediently did as well as she&#10;could.  But she was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she&#10;thought, &quot;We shall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles&#10;from these parts, and such as this can never happen again, and no&#10;ghost of the past reach there.&quot;&#10;&#10;They parted tenderly that night on the landing, and Clare ascended to&#10;his attic.  Tess sat up getting on with some little requisites, lest&#10;the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time.  While she&#10;sat she heard a noise in Angel's room overhead," />
    <node id="Tess is reluctant to remove the jewels because she has something important to discuss with Angel Clare and wants to use the jewelry as a prop or aid in their conversation. She hopes that the jewels, which were given to her by her wealthy relative Alec d'Urberville, might help her maintain her social standing and fit in with Clare's expectations of marriage.&#10;&#10;At the same time, Tess also contemplates selling the jewels because she is aware of their dubious origins and feels guilty about accepting them. She knows that they represent a part of her past that she would rather forget, and worries that keeping them might ultimately cause problems in her relationship with Clare. However, she ultimately decides to put them on at Clare's urging, hoping that they will help her present herself as a suitable partner for him." />
    <node id="-frock--yes, better than in this, well as you support these&#10;dignities.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess's sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of&#10;excitement, which was yet not happiness.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll take them off,&quot; she said, &quot;in case Jonathan should see me.&#10;They are not fit for me, are they?  They must be sold, I suppose?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let them stay a few minutes longer.  Sell them?  Never. It would be&#10;a breach of faith.&quot;&#10;&#10;Influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed.  She had something&#10;to tell, and there might be help in these.  She sat down with the&#10;jewels upon her; and they again indulged in conjectures as to where&#10;Jonathan could possibly be with their baggage.  The ale they had&#10;poured out for his consumption when he came had gone flat with long&#10;standing.&#10;&#10;Shortly after this they began supper, which was already laid on&#10;a side-table.

He remembered how, when he was a lad of&#10;fifteen, his godmother, the Squire's wife--the only rich person&#10;with whom he had ever come in contact--had pinned her faith to his&#10;success; had prophesied a wondrous career for him.

It was but a question of vanity throughout; and&#10;if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be&#10;admitted into the other.  His wife was a d'Urberville: whom could&#10;they become better than her?&#10;&#10;Suddenly he said with enthusiasm--&#10;&#10;&quot;Tess, put them on--put them on!&quot;  And he turned from the fire to&#10;help her.&#10;&#10;But as if by magic she had already donned them--necklace, ear-rings,&#10;bracelets, and all.&#10;&#10;&quot;But the gown isn't right, Tess,&quot; said Clare.  &quot;It ought to be a low&#10;one for a set of brilliants like that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ought it?&quot; said Tess.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said he.&#10;&#10;He suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice, so&#10;as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and&#10;when she had done this, and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated&#10;amid the whiteness of her throat" />
    <node id="The gentleman who has chosen Tess is Mr. Clare (Angel Clare). This decision has significantly impacted Tess's perspective and actions in several ways:&#10;&#10;1) Change in identity: Tess realizes that she will no longer be a milkmaid but become Mrs. Clare, married to a gentleman. This realization brings about a mix of emotions in Tess - excitement, apprehension, and the challenge of leaving behind everything she has ever known.&#10;&#10;2) Controlling the revelation of her past: Tess destroys the letter she had written to Angel Clare, avoiding revealing her past to him before she is ready. She wants to maintain some control over when and how he learns about her bygone trouble.&#10;&#10;3) Using jewels as a prop: Tess contemplates selling the jewels given to her by Alec d'Urberville due to their dubious origins and her guilt about accepting them. However, she decides to put them on at Clare's urging, hoping they will help her present herself as a suitable partner for him.&#10;&#10;4) Preparation for marriage: Tess ensures that all the necessary steps, such as the three times of asking in church, are followed for her marriage to Mr. Clare." />
    <node id="Based on the supportive materials provided, Tess and the unnamed male character (later revealed to be Angel Clare) share their first common meal alone in the ancient parlor. During this occasion, Clare is described as finding it interesting to use the same bread-and-butter plate as Tess and to brush crumbs from her lips with his own. This childishness or frivolity on Clare's part stands out because Tess does not seem to enter into these activities with the same level of enthusiasm.&#10;&#10;Regarding how Clare sees Tess during this occasion, he thinks to himself that she is a &quot;dear dear Tess&quot; and reflects on her laughter, which he describes as being like the laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won from all other women. He also notes the buoyancy of her tread and compares it to the skim of a bird that has not quite alighted. These observations suggest that Clare sees Tess as a desirable, almost ethereal figure during their meal together. The sensory details provided in this passage, such as the golden staff of sunlight stretching across to Tess's skirt and the spot like a paint-mark set upon her, further underscore the significance of this moment for both characters." />
    <node id="They are all yours,&quot; said she, very prettily, and endeavoured&#10;to be gayer than she was.  He had not been displeased with her&#10;thoughtfulness on such an occasion; it was what every sensible woman&#10;would show: but Tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess,&#10;and struggled against it.&#10;&#10;The sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it&#10;shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which&#10;stretched across to her skirt, where it made a spot like a paint-mark&#10;set upon her.  They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and&#10;here they shared their first common meal alone.  Such was their&#10;childishness, or rather his, that he found it interesting to use the&#10;same bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her&#10;lips with his own.  He wondered a little that she did not enter into&#10;these frivolities with his own zest.&#10;&#10;Looking at her silently for a long time; &quot;She is a dear dear Tess,&quot;&#10;he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of&#10;a difficult passage.  &quot;Do I realize solemn" />

They marked the buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a&#10;bird which has not quite alighted.&#10;&#10;Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being;&#10;it enveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness&#10;of her past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would&#10;persist in their attempts to touch her--doubt, fear, moodiness, care,&#10;shame. She knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the&#10;circumscribing light, but she had long spells of power to keep them&#10;in hungry subjection there.&#10;&#10;A spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual&#10;remembrance.  She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the&#10;background those shapes of darkness were always spread.  They might&#10;be receding, or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little&#10;every day.&#10;&#10;&#10;One evening Tess and Clare were obliged to" />

    <node id="When Tess's partner, Angel Clare, brings up the idea of postponing their marriage until after he has secured his new position, Tess experiences a mix of emotions. On one hand, she understands the practicality of this decision as it would ensure financial stability for their future together. However, on the other hand, she is apprehensive about the reality of marriage looming so near and feels startled by the prospect of delaying their union.&#10;&#10;Tess also recognizes that she will have to help Clare in making his start in his new position, which further emphasizes the need for a postponement. Despite her reservations, Tess ultimately agrees to this arrangement, signifying her commitment to supporting Clare and building a life together. This decision demonstrates Tess's maturity and willingness to prioritize their future as a couple over her immediate desires." />
    <node id="The sealed package delivered to Angel Clare from his late godmother's estate contains a morocco leather case with a note and a key inside. The note reveals that on the death of his godmother, Clare inherited some money. This inheritance is significant as it provides financial stability for Tess and Angel, allowing them to start their married life without immediate financial concerns. The key in the package likely unlocks a box or container where the inherited money is kept, emphasizing the practical support Tess's husband now has to offer their relationship." />
    <node id="The speaker, Tess, envisions a future with Angel Clare that involves leaving her current life behind, including her family and social circle, to establish a new identity as Mrs. Clare. She is excited about the prospect of spending her life with him but also feels apprehensive about the potential disapproval from society due to her past. The role of Clare's familial background is significant as his inheritance from his late godmother provides financial stability for their future together, allowing them to start their married life without immediate financial concerns. This emphasizes the practical support Clare can offer their relationship and alleviates some of the tension surrounding Tess's modest socioeconomic status.&#10;&#10;In addition, Tess uses the jewels given to her by Alec d'Urberville as a prop or aid in their conversation, hoping that they might help her maintain her social standing and fit in with Clare's expectations of marriage. However, she also contemplates selling the jewels due to their dubious origins and her guilt about accepting them, knowing that they represent a part of her past that she would rather forget. Ultimately, Tess decides to put them on at Clare's urging, hoping that they will help her present herself as a suitable partner for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Tess's vision for their future with Angel Clare includes leaving her current home and family to start a new life together based on their marriage and the proofs of her descent from Parson Tringham. She is willing to confront potential disapproval from society due to her past and use the jewels as a means to maintain her social standing in their relationship. The inheritance from Clare's late godmother provides financial stability for their future together, emphasizing the practical support he can offer their relationship." />
    <node id=" the mantel-shelf was flushed with the high-coloured light, and&#10;the legs of the table nearest the fire.  Tess's face and neck&#10;reflected the same warmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran&#10;or a Sirius--a constellation of white, red, and green flashes, that&#10;interchanged their hues with her every pulsation.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about&#10;telling our faults?&quot; he asked abruptly, finding that she still&#10;remained immovable.  &quot;We spoke lightly perhaps, and you may well&#10;have done so.  But for me it was no light promise.

Ah--you thought too highly of me.  Now&#10;listen.  Put your head there, because I want you to forgive me, and&#10;not to be indignant with me for not telling you before, as perhaps&#10;" />
    <node id="When the wife, Tess, found herself alone in her room for the last time, she knelt down and prayed. She tried to pray to God, but her thoughts were mainly focused on her husband, Angel Clare. This demonstrates her extreme devotion and idolization of him, which she herself admits is bordering on being ill-omened. Tess is aware of the potential dangers of such intense emotions, as expressed by Friar Laurence's quote &quot;These violent delights have violent ends.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tess and Angel have decided to spend a few days at lodgings near Wellbridge Mill, where Angel will be investigating flour processes. The primary reason for their stay there is not practical, but rather sentimental - the farmhouse used to be the mansion of a branch of the d'Urberville family, and this fact appeals to Angel's emotional side.&#10;&#10;Once alone in her room, Tess reflects on her own identity and questions whether she has the moral right to take her husband's name, given her past as Mrs Alexander d'Urberville. She struggles with the idea of intense love justifying what some may consider culpable reticence.&#10;&#10;After finding a letter she had written to Angel but never given to him, Tess hides it under the carpet and out of sight, fearing its contents would ruin their wedding day happiness. This action demonstrates her continued struggle with whether or not to reveal her past to her husband, ultimately deciding to destroy the letter instead of sharing its contents." />
    <node id=" when she found herself alone in her room for a few&#10;minutes--the last day this on which she was ever to enter it--she&#10;knelt down and prayed.  She tried to pray to God, but it was her&#10;husband who really had her supplication.  Her idolatry of this man&#10;was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill-omened.  She was&#10;conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence: &quot;These violent&#10;delights have violent ends.&quot;  It might be too desperate for human&#10;conditions--too rank, to wild, too deadly.&#10;&#10;&quot;O my love, why do I love you so!&quot; she whispered there alone; &quot;for&#10;she you love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I&#10;might have been!&quot;&#10;&#10;Afternoon came, and with it the hour for departure. They had decided&#10;to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old&#10;farmhouse near Wellbridge Mill, at which he meant to reside during&#10;his investigation of flour processes.

She&#10;was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?&#10;Was she not more truly Mrs Alexander d'Urberville?  Could intensity&#10;of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable&#10;reticence?  She knew not what was expected of women in such cases;&#10;and she had no counsellor.&#10;&#10;However, when she found herself alone in her room for a few&#10;minutes--the last day this on which she was ever to enter it--she&#10;knelt" />

My own love--how&#10;good, how kind!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no, Tess; just an order to a tradeswoman in London--nothing&#10;more.&quot;&#10;&#10;And to divert her from thinking too highly of him, he told her to go&#10;upstairs, and take her time, and see if it all fitted; and, if not,&#10;to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations.&#10;&#10;She did return upstairs, and put on the gown.  Alone, she stood for a&#10;moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire; and&#10;then there came into her head her mother's ballad of the mystic&#10;robe--&#10;&#10;&#10;     That never would become that wife&#10;       That had once done amiss,&#10;&#10;&#10;which Mrs Durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a" />

He and another man brought her home, thinking a' was&#10;dead; but she fetched round by degrees.&quot;&#10;&#10;Angel, suddenly recollecting that Tess was overhearing this gloomy&#10;tale, went to shut the door between the passage and the ante-room&#10;to the inner parlour where she was; but his wife, flinging a shawl&#10;round her, had come to the outer room and was listening to the man's&#10;narrative, her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of&#10;rain glistening upon it.&#10;&#10;&quot;And, more than this, there's Marian; she's been found dead drunk&#10;by the withy-bed--a girl who hev never been known to" />
    <node id="The two men, who are unnamed in the narrative, initially claim they made a mistake by not asking for Tess's hand in marriage when she was younger. They later admit that this was a lie and they had always intended to ask for her hand but wanted to wait until she was more mature. This demonstrates their respect for Tess and their belief in her worth, as well as their own readiness to commit to her.&#10;&#10;Tess's fiancé, Angel Clare, suggesting to postpone their wedding has significance because it shows his practicality and concern for their financial stability. By waiting until he secures his new position, they can ensure a more stable future together. This decision also highlights Tess's maturity and willingness to prioritize their future as a couple over her immediate desires, further emphasizing her growth throughout the narrative.&#10;&#10;In both cases, the men are being cautious and considerate, ensuring that they are making the right decisions for themselves and for Tess. Their actions reflect their respect for Tess and their desire to build a strong foundation for their relationships with her." />
    <node id="Τess's reaction to the new gown and accessories shows her excitement about transforming her identity from a milkmaid to Mrs. Clare, but it also brings up feelings of apprehension and guilt. The significance of Tess's reaction is tied to her mother's ballad of the mystic robe, which suggests that the gown will only become Tess if she has never done amiss. This alludes to Tess's past transgressions and foreshadows potential challenges in her relationship with Angel Clare due to her hidden past.&#10;&#10;Tess standing before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire reflects her contemplation of her new identity, while also being reminded of her mother's ballad. The gown serves as a symbol of her new life and social status, but it also highlights the deception she is engaging in by not revealing her past to Clare. This internal conflict is further emphasized when Tess considers selling the jewels due to their dubious origins, yet ultimately decides to wear them for Clare, hoping they will help maintain her social standing. The gown and accessories are thus significant in representing Tess's desire for a new beginning while also highlighting her fears of her past catching up with her." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, there were changes discussed regarding Tess's assistance at the farm during the winter months. The cows were going dry rapidly, which meant that they would require less care and assistance from the milkmaids. Specifically, six or seven cows went to the straw-barton yesterday, and three the day before, making nearly twenty in the straw already.&#10;&#10;However, the farmer did not specifically mention not needing Tess's help anymore due to decreased work with cows going dry. Crick, who is in charge of the dairy, did not say to Tess that he would no longer require her assistance during the winter months. Instead, he communicated this to her fiancé, Angel Clare, in a good-natured and respectful manner.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while there were changes discussed regarding Tess's assistance at the farm during the winter months due to decreased work with cows going dry, the farmer did not specifically mention not needing her help anymore." />
    <node id=" is.  Perhaps I saw that before you did.&quot;&#10;&#10;She was seeing it then.  To decline to marry him after all--in&#10;obedience to her emotion of last night--and leave the dairy, meant&#10;to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in&#10;request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm&#10;where no divine being like Angel Clare was.  She hated the thought,&#10;and she hated more the thought of going home.&#10;&#10;&quot;So that, seriously, dearest Tess,&quot; he continued, &quot;since you will&#10;probably have to leave at Christmas, it is in every way desirable and&#10;convenient that I should carry you off then as my property.

Six or seven went to the straw-barton yesterday, and three the&#10;day before, making nearly twenty in the straw already.  Ah--is it&#10;that the farmer don't want my help for the calving?  O, I am not&#10;wanted here any more!  And I have tried so hard to--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Crick didn't exactly say that he would no longer require you.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Tess should remind her fiancé, Angel Clare, about the third call of the banns that is required before their New Year's Eve wedding. If they have forgotten to arrange for it to be called, there may not be enough time left to have it done before their wedding date. Forgetting to have the banns called could result in someone standing up and challenging their union due to Tess's past transgressions, which could lead to embarrassment or distress.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, Tess's friend Izz Huett mentioned the omission of the banns to Mrs. Crick, who assumed matronly privileges and spoke to Angel about it. As a result, Clare decided on obtaining a license instead, which bypassed the need for additional church calls of the banns and eliminated the risk of anyone challenging their union due to Tess's past experiences.&#10;&#10;Therefore, if Tess realizes that the third call of the banns has not been made, she should bring it up with Angel as soon as possible so they can make alternative arrangements, such as obtaining a license, to ensure their wedding can proceed as planned without any unexpected challenges or delays." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there is no information indicating that Crick implied to Tess that her services wouldn't be needed much during the winter months on the farm due to her and Clare no longer being in a relationship. In fact, Crick communicated Tess's upcoming absence to Clare in a good-natured and respectful manner without mentioning their previous relationship. The changes discussed regarding Tess's assistance at the farm during the winter months were due to decreased work with cows going dry, not because of her personal life." />

    <node id="The house that Clare and the woman encounter at Wellbridge is a farmhouse which was once a portion of a fine manorial residence and the seat of a d'Urberville. It has exterior features well-known to all travelers through the Froom Valley. The house has a significant history as it was owned by a branch of the d'Urberville family, but after its partial demolition, it is now used as a farmhouse. Currently, a farmer who has gone to visit friends owns the house, and he has let out a couple of rooms to Clare and the woman.

    <node id="Clothing has a significant impact on Tess's beauty, as noted by Angel Clare when he sees her in her evening wear. He remarks that she is incredibly beautiful, highlighting the transformative power of fashion and accessories. Clare admits that he had not previously appreciated the artistic excellence of Tess's limbs and features until she was dressed in finery, emphasizing how clothing can enhance one's appearance and draw attention to natural beauty.&#10;&#10;This transformation is further accentuated when Tess puts on jewelry given to her by Alec d'Urberville. Although she contemplates selling the jewels due to their dubious origins and feels guilty about accepting them, she ultimately decides to wear them for Clare, hoping they will help maintain her social standing. These accessories contribute to Tess's striking appearance and boost Clare's admiration of her beauty.&#10;&#10;However, despite being captivated by Tess in her evening attire, Clare expresses his preference for her simpler wing-bonnet and cotton-frock, stating that he loves her best in this humble clothing. This suggests that Clare values Tess's authenticity and appreciates her natural beauty over her appearance in fashionable clothes.

These descriptions add to the peaceful and picturesque setting of the meadows during this season, highlighting the beauty of nature as Tess and Clare walk through it.&#10;&#10;The significance of the soil in this context is that it represents the rich history and tradition of farming and dairy work in the region. The fact that the men are working on &quot;taking up&quot; the meadows indicates the cyclical nature of agricultural work, where the land must be prepared for winter irrigation. Tess's own connection to the land and her family's farming history is also emphasized in this scene, as she takes a walk with Clare through the meadows that have been an essential part of her life.

She is fascinated by Tess's upcoming marriage and even touches her shoulders and waist as if trying to comprehend the situation. Izz Huett, played by Suzanna Hamilton in the 1979 film adaptation of Tess, echoes Retty Priddle's feelings and goes a step further by kissing Tess and calling her an &quot;angel.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Marian, Retty Priddle, and Izz all feel supportive of Tess becoming Angel Clare's wife.

This decision shows Tess's desire to move forward with Clare and build a future together, despite the potential problems her past may cause.&#10;&#10;For Clare, the jewels serve as a symbol of Tess's past, but he does not yet know the full story behind them. His preference for Tess in her simpler wing-bonnet and cotton-frock suggests that he values authenticity and appreciates her natural beauty over her appearance in fashionable clothes.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, there is no clear indication of any inappropriate relationship between Clare and the dairyman's wife. When Clare sits next to her at the table, she insists that he do so, but this could be interpreted as simple hospitality rather than flirtation. Furthermore, when Clare later stands up, it is revealed that Tess was sitting very close to him, leading the dairyman's wife to mistakenly assume that they were sitting together intentionally.&#10;&#10;When the dairyman's wife learns of this, she reacts with surprise and comments that &quot;folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't.&quot; This reaction suggests that she is not trying to create a scandalous situation, but is rather concerned about how her actions may have been misinterpreted by others. Additionally, her husband's response further supports this interpretation, as he expresses relief that he had not noticed anything untoward and emphasizes the importance of not jumping to conclusions.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any significant tension or inappropriate relationship between Clare and the dairyman's wife.

The changes discussed regarding Tess's assistance at the farm during the winter months were due to decreased work with cows going dry, not because of her personal life.">

The kiss had&#10;obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue.&#10;&#10;Of all this Clare was unconscious.  Passing on to the wicket-gate he&#10;shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and expressed his last&#10;thanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment&#10;of silence before they had moved off.  It was interrupted by the&#10;crowing of a cock.

When Clare sits next to her at the table, she insists that he do so, but this could be interpreted as simple hospitality rather than flirtation. Furthermore, when Clare later stands up, it is revealed that Tess was sitting very close to him, leading the dairyman's wife to mistakenly assume that they were sitting together intentionally.&#10;&#10;When the dairyman's wife learns of this, she reacts with surprise and comments that &quot;folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't.&quot; This reaction suggests that she is not trying to create a scandalous situation, but is rather concerned about how her actions may have been misinterpreted by others. Additionally, her husband's response further supports this interpretation, as he expresses relief that he had not noticed anything untoward and emphasizes the importance of not jumping to conclusions.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any significant tension or inappropriate relationship between Clare and the dairyman's wife. Instead, the interaction appears to be a misunderstanding based on Tess's unintentionally close proximity to Clare.">

The role of Clare's familial background is significant as his inheritance from his late godmother provides financial stability for their future together, allowing them to start their married life without immediate financial concerns. This emphasizes the practical support Clare can offer their relationship and alleviates some of the tension surrounding Tess's modest socioeconomic status.&#10;&#10;In addition, Tess uses the jewels given to her by Alec d'Urberville as a prop or aid in their conversation, hoping that they might help her maintain her social standing and fit in with Clare's expectations of marriage. However, she also contemplates selling the jewels due to their dubious origins and her guilt about accepting them, knowing that they represent a part of her past that she would rather forget. Ultimately, Tess decides to put them on at Clare's urging, hoping that they will help her present herself as a suitable partner for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Tess's vision for their future with Angel Clare includes leaving her current home and family to start a new life together based on their marriage and the proofs of her descent from Parson Tringham. She is willing to confront potential disapproval from society due to her past and use the jewels as a means to maintain her social standing in their relationship.

Clare's reaction to the jewels does not reveal as much about his thoughts on the past and the future compared to Tess, but it does highlight his appreciation for Tess's genuine self.&#10;&#10;Overall, the reactions of both Tess and Clare towards the rediscovered jewels reveal their thoughts about the past and the future. Tess hopes to use the jewels as a way to maintain her social standing and secure her future with Clare, while also grappling with feelings of guilt and apprehension about her past. Meanwhile, Clare values Tess's authenticity and appreciates her natural beauty, suggesting that he may be more understanding and accepting of her past once he becomes fully aware of it.">

    <node id="1. Introductions: The participants introduce themselves at the beginning of the conversation. The industrial designer (Mael) and marketing representative (Anna) are meeting the rest of the team for the first time.&#10;&#10;2. Product Testing: The team is testing a new design, possibly a whiteboard with sensor capabilities, as mentioned by the user interface representative. There were some technical issues during the testing process, but they were able to resolve them.&#10;&#10;3. Cord Exclusion: The industrial designer has decided to exclude a cord from the product's design, which was discussed earlier in the project. The project manager asks if they have worked out the cord issue, and Mael confirms that they will not include it. However, there is no explicit confirmation in the conversation about whether the product still functions properly without the cord.&#10;&#10;4. User Interface: Matthew, the user interface representative, explains how users can interact with the product, specifically mentioning a sensor to record strokes made on the whiteboard's surface.&#10;&#10;5. Marketing Perspective: The marketing representative (Anna) shares her perspective on the product, comparing it to a normal whiteboard from a user experience standpoint.&#10;&#10;Overall, this conversation focuses on the team testing and discussing the design of a new product, with input from various perspectives such as industrial design, user interface, project management, and marketing." />

    <node id="1. Shared Folder: The participants are discussing a shared folder where they can store and share documents related to the project. The industrial designer mentions that they will use this shared folder for documents, and the project manager is not yet fully updated on how it works.&#10;&#10;2. Potential Computer Program: The project manager briefly refers to a computer program that they haven't found yet but will discuss later. There is no clear connection made between this potential computer program and the rest of the conversation.&#10;&#10;3. Smart Whiteboard Testing: The team is planning to try out a smart whiteboard, which has sensor capabilities for recording strokes made on its surface. They have some technical issues during the testing process, but they are working on resolving them. Users can interact with the product like a normal whiteboard, and it will record what they write down through a sensor.&#10;&#10;In summary, the participants are discussing using a shared folder for document storage, planning to explore a potential computer program, and trying out and testing a smart whiteboard for their project needs." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the participants compared the smart whiteboard to different animals throughout the conversation. At first, they referred to it as a &quot;cat&quot; and later corrected this to say it was more like a &quot;dog.&quot; Towards the end of the discussion, they started referring to the smart whiteboard as a &quot;shark,&quot; with the industrial designer even calling it a &quot;baby shark&quot; at one point. However, there is no explicit determination or conclusion made about what type of animal the smart whiteboard is supposed to represent in the end." />

    <node id="1. Obvious and easy-to-use main controls: Since the primary use of the remote control will be for basic functions like volume and channel controls, these buttons should be designed to be prominent and effortless to use. This ensures that users can quickly access and operate the main features without confusion or frustration.&#10;2. Cost-effective design: With a budget of 25 Euros per unit, it is essential to maintain a balance between functionality and cost. The remote control's design should focus on excluding unnecessary fancy features while still providing a good user experience.&#10;3. Trendy and original appearance: To appeal to the target market, the remote control should have an up-to-date and fashionable look, as well as an original design that differentiates it from competitors' products.&#10;4. User-friendly interface: The layout of buttons and their functions should be intuitive for users, minimizing the learning curve and making operation straightforward. This includes clear labeling and logical grouping of related functions.&#10;5. Internet connectivity (optional): Although primarily used for basic functions, adding internet connectivity as an optional feature could expand the remote control's capabilities and appeal to a broader audience. However, this should be considered carefully in terms of cost, complexity, and overall value to the user." />

By including numbering buttons, teletext features, and browsing capabilities in their design specifications, the group aims to create a user-friendly and functional remote control that meets the needs of their international customer base. They believe that having a good product can help them achieve their financial goals within this large market.&#10;&#10;4. The &quot;channel up&quot; and &quot;channel down&quot; buttons will enable convenient and time-efficient browsing of channels in an upward or downward direction, making it particularly useful for users with numerous channels. This feature contributes to the overall user-friendly interface of the remote control while saving users the effort of manually entering channel numbers." target="1. New functions or features being considered for future television technology include numbering buttons, teletext features, and browsing capabilities. These elements were agreed upon by the group, consisting of a marketing representative (Anna), user interface representative (Matthew), industrial designer (Mael), and project manager. They aim to create a user-friendly and functional remote control that meets the needs of their international customer base while remaining flexible with adding functions and ensuring internet connectivity.&#10;&#10;2. When designing for technologies that have not been invented yet, the team approaches this challenge by focusing on creating a solid foundation during the functional design phase. Each member is assigned specific tasks related to the functional design of the remote control. After completing the functional design phase, they will discuss and refine the initial designs in the conceptual design phase, considering factors such as cost-effectiveness, user-friendly interface, and trendy appearance. Finally, during the detailed design phase, they work on solidifying the design while maintaining a balance between functionality and cost to ensure that the end product is original, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team considers new functions like numbering buttons, teletext features, and browsing for future television technology. To tackle un invented technologies, they focus on functional design and remain flexible with adding functions during the design process.">

    <edge source="1. The purpose of the meeting, as discussed by the project manager, is to kick off their latest project which involves designing a new remote control while remaining flexible with adding functions and ensuring internet connectivity. The agenda of the meeting includes getting acquainted with each other and understanding their roles in the project. They will also be introduced to the technical tools provided for communication and learning from each other's plans.&#10;&#10;The technical tools mentioned are:&#10;&#10;* Shared folder for documents, which is used to store and share documents related to the project. The industrial designer mentions that they will use this shared folder for documents, and the project manager is not yet fully updated on how it works.&#10;* A potential computer program that the project manager briefly refers to but doesn't elaborate on.&#10;* Smart whiteboard testing, which has sensor capabilities for recording strokes made on its surface. They have some technical issues during the testing process, but they are working on resolving them. Users can interact with the product like a normal whiteboard, and it will record what they write down through a sensor.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the meeting covers discussing the product's look and requirements, such as internet connectivity, and planning to explore a potential computer program for their project needs. It seems that the participants are also brainstorming and sharing early concepts for a feline-inspired design in a casual setting." target="The interaction between the Industrial Designer, User Interface expert, and Project Manager results in successfully testing the design involving the use of the command 'Alt F\_five'.

    <node id="The speakers are discussing and analyzing language usage, specifically focusing on the phrase &quot;I'm out of film.&quot; The main issue is that the phrase can be interpreted in different ways. One interpretation is that it means the speaker has run out of film, i.e., they have no more film left. However, some participants find this interpretation a bit far-fetched because the preposition &quot;out of&quot; usually indicates that something has moved away from its original location, and it's unclear how a physical object like film can move on its own.&#10;&#10;The speakers also question whether &quot;I'm out of film&quot; implies that the speaker is no longer in a state of having film or if it simply suggests they have run out of this resource. They contemplate alternative ways to express the idea, such as &quot;the film ran out&quot; or &quot;the film is out,&quot; which seem more intuitive in terms of location and movement.&#10;&#10;Overall, the discussion revolves around understanding the nuances of language usage, specifically how prepositions like &quot;out of&quot; can affect meaning, and whether these interpretations are literal, metaphorical, or based on common usage." />

    <node id="1. Physical collision: The phrase &quot;run into&quot; can be used to describe a situation where a car collides with an object, such as a telephone pole or a cafe. In this context, &quot;run into&quot; indicates that the car has made contact with the object due to some form of motion or movement.&#10;&#10;2. Social encounter: The phrase &quot;run into&quot; can also be used to describe a chance meeting with an old friend or acquaintance. In this context, &quot;run into&quot; implies an unplanned and unexpected social interaction between two individuals who happen to come across each other in a particular location.&#10;&#10;These different interpretations of &quot;run into&quot; highlight the versatility and context-dependence of language, as well as the role that prepositions like &quot;into&quot; can play in shaping meaning. In some cases, &quot;into&quot; might suggest physical movement or collision, while in others, it could imply a social interaction or encounter." />

    <node id="1. Speakers Grad A, Grad F, and possibly others were participating in a meeting or discussion that was comfortable (Grad A's first statement) and smooth (Grad F's statement). This indicates a positive atmosphere and general agreement among the speakers during the initial part of the conversation.&#10;2. The topic of their discussion is language usage, specifically focusing on the phrase &quot;I'm out of film.&quot; The attitudes expressed towards this topic include frustration (Grad F) and curiosity about alternative ways to express the idea (Grad A). This suggests that the speakers are engaged in analyzing linguistic nuances, which can be a complex and sometimes frustrating task.&#10;3. Grad A mentions Taiwan and other places to eat, suggesting a possible connection between the discussion on language usage and their personal experiences or preferences related to food and travel. It is unclear whether this reference is directly related to the topic of &quot;I'm out of film&quot; or if it serves as a side note or example in the conversation.&#10;4. Grad D expresses confusion about being recorded, indicating that there might be additional context outside the provided transcript that would help clarify their role and involvement in the discussion. This interjection does not seem directly related to the topic of &quot;I'm out of film&quot; but rather concerns the logistics or format of the meeting itself.&#10;5. Overall, the speakers demonstrate a mix of positive (comfort, smoothness), negative (frustration), and neutral attitudes towards the topic of language usage, with varying levels of engagement and curiosity about exploring alternative expressions and interpretations. The references to personal experiences and preferences add context to their discussion while highlighting the complexities of language use in everyday conversations." />

    <node id="1. &quot;I'm out of film&quot; suggests that the speaker has left the state of having film or being in possession of it. This interpretation is based on the preposition &quot;out of,&quot; which can indicate departure from a state or location, and the association between &quot;having&quot; and location.&#10;2. Running out of something implies a process where the resource is depleted over time, whereas being out of film (or any other resource) focuses more on the final outcome or current state, without necessarily implying a process.&#10;3. Being out of somewhere, such as in &quot;I'm out of the house,&quot; refers to leaving a physical location. However, when applied to resources like film, it takes on a metaphorical meaning, indicating that one is no longer in possession of or has access to the resource.&#10;4. The phrase &quot;I'm out of film&quot; differs from alternative expressions like &quot;the film ran out&quot; or &quot;the film is out&quot; because it places more emphasis on the speaker's current state rather than focusing on the resource itself. This subtle difference in perspective can influence how the listener understands and interprets the situation." />

    <node id="1. Mimicking of synthesis: The speakers discussed the issue of individuals mimicking the synthesis when they speak to a computer, trying to match their prosody onto the machine. This is likely in reference to the way people adjust their speech patterns while interacting with voice-activated systems or virtual assistants. No specific resolution was mentioned in the transcript regarding this issue.&#10;2. Rephrasing: Speaker C mentioned plans to discuss problems with rephrasing and how they were solved. However, the details of these issues and resolutions were not provided in the transcript. It is possible that the speakers briefly touched upon this topic without going into much detail.&#10;&#10;Without more context or information from the transcript, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive answer to the question.

    <node id="The role of time in determining the type of knowledge needed to answer a question is highlighted by the example of trying to locate a nightclub outside of its operating hours. In this case, knowing the spatial location of the nightclub is not sufficient to achieve the goal of entering the establishment. Instead, the seeker must acquire additional knowledge about the nightclub's opening hours, which may be obtained through alternative means such as phone calls or online resources.&#10;&#10;Here, time plays a crucial role in shaping the type of knowledge required to answer the question of how to access the nightclub. If it were within operating hours, spatial location would be the primary determinant of the necessary knowledge. However, since the nightclub is outside its operating hours, temporal knowledge becomes essential, illustrating how time can influence the type of information needed to address a particular query or problem." />

    <node id="The transcript suggests that &quot;run into&quot; is more commonly used than &quot;walked smacked into&quot; or &quot;slammed into&quot; when referring to an accidental collision because of the implications of speed and force associated with &quot;run&quot; and &quot;slam.&quot; &quot;Run into&quot; implies a faster and stronger impact, which may be more appropriate for describing accidents. On the other hand, &quot;walked smacked into&quot; may imply a slower pace or less force, making it seem less critical or serious. Similarly, &quot;slammed into&quot; might indicate an excessive amount of force that may not always be present in accidental collisions. Therefore, &quot;run into&quot; is a more versatile and commonly used phrase for such situations." />
    <node id="In this framework, construal plays a significant role as an additional mechanism that allows for basic cases (such as physical containers and paths) to be applied to metaphorical and metonymic cases, and for new constructions or metaphors to interact and compose with all other constructions. The reason why the thesis proposal does not clearly explain this is because it fails to mention that basic cases exist, even though nothing in language is completely context-free. This crucial point about the role of construal in scaling up the application of constructions to various cases needs to be made clearer in the thesis proposal." />
    <node id="aker: Professor E&#10;Content: Et cetera . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's where this , um ,&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule .&#10;Speaker: Professor E&#10;Content: Right . So 's it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: No , it doesn't say it at all . No . Even though {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One could argue what {disfmarker} if there are basic cases , even . I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free .&#10;Speaker: Professor E&#10;Content: Oh , nothing is context - free , but there are basic cases .

    <node id=" only base cases . And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at {disfmarker} at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor E&#10;Content: And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor E&#10;Content: And it {disfmarker} to the extent that that 's true then {disfmarker} then it 's a big win over anything that exists .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .&#10;" />

    <node id="1. You can ask &quot;Where can I find out about [topic related to the developmental state]?&quot; This approach focuses on gathering knowledge about the topic rather than inquiring about its physical location. The respondent may then provide you with resources, websites, or contact information for further exploration.&#10;&#10;2. Phrase your question as &quot;How can I learn more about [aspect of the developmental state]?&quot; This formulation emphasizes learning and gaining insight into the subject matter, without explicitly requesting spatial details. The answer could include sources such as books, articles, or experts in the field.&#10;&#10;3. Another way to phrase your question is &quot;What are some key aspects of [topic related to the developmental state]?&quot; This formulation focuses on understanding the essential components or characteristics of the subject matter without referencing its spatial location. The response could include a list of features, concepts, or theories associated with the developmental state.&#10;&#10;4. You could also ask &quot;Who are some notable figures in [field related to the developmental state]?&quot; This question helps you identify important individuals contributing to the field, who may have written articles, books, or given speeches that provide information about the developmental state without requiring spatial knowledge.&#10;&#10;5. Lastly, consider asking &quot;What resources are available for understanding [topic related to the developmental state]?&quot; This formulation allows the respondent to suggest various materials, such as documentaries, podcasts, or online courses, which can help you learn about the subject matter without having to worry about its spatial location." />

    <node id="Grad C and Professor E argue that construal plays a significant role in understanding how people interact with Human-Technology Interaction (HTI) systems. According to them, construal is the process by which users interpret and understand HTI systems in different ways. For example, a cafe can be construed as a container, an obstacle, or a physical object, depending on the context. This means that even seemingly simple interactions with HTI systems can be ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.&#10;&#10;Moreover, they suggest that construal is key to discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems because it allows users to make sense of these systems in their own terms. Even if people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less metaphorical, as Grad C suggests, construal is still a crucial factor in understanding how they engage with these systems.&#10;&#10;Professor E also highlights the interaction between analysis and construal as an important aspect of HTI systems. The &quot;double arrow&quot; he refers to may indicate the need for a two-way process of analyzing user behavior while also accounting for the different ways in which users construe the system. This suggests that designing effective HTI systems requires not only technical expertise but also an understanding of how users interpret and make sense of these systems.&#10;&#10;In short, construal plays a crucial role in discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems by allowing users to interpret and understand these systems in their own terms, and requiring designers to account for this variability in their analysis and design processes." />

This interpretation is based on the preposition &quot;out of,&quot; which can indicate departure from a state or location, and the association between &quot;having&quot; and location.&#10;2. Running out of something implies a process where the resource is depleted over time, whereas being out of film (or any other resource) focuses more on the final outcome or current state, without necessarily implying a process.&#10;3. Being out of somewhere, such as in &quot;I'm out of the house,&quot; refers to leaving a physical location. However, when applied to resources like film, it takes on a metaphorical meaning, indicating that one is no longer in possession of or has access to the resource.&#10;4. The phrase &quot;I'm out of film&quot; differs from alternative expressions like &quot;the film ran out&quot; or &quot;the film is out&quot; because it places more emphasis on the speaker's current state rather than focusing on the resource itself. This subtle difference in perspective can influence how the listener understands and interprets the situation.">

Physical collision: The phrase &quot;run into&quot; can be used to describe a situation where a car collides with an object, such as a telephone pole or a cafe. In this context, &quot;run into&quot; indicates that the car has made contact with the object due to some form of motion or movement.&#10;&#10;2. Social encounter: The phrase &quot;run into&quot; can also be used to describe a chance meeting with an old friend or acquaintance. In this context, &quot;run into&quot; implies an unplanned and unexpected social interaction between two individuals who happen to come across each other in a particular location.&#10;&#10;These different interpretations of &quot;run into&quot; highlight the versatility and context-dependence of language, as well as the role that prepositions like &quot;into&quot; can play in shaping meaning. In some cases, &quot;into&quot; might suggest physical movement or collision, while in others, it could imply a social interaction or encounter.">

This interpretation is based on the preposition &quot;out of,&quot; which can indicate departure from a state or location, and the association between &quot;having&quot; and location.&#10;2. Running out of something implies a process where the resource is depleted over time, whereas being out of film (or any other resource) focuses more on the final outcome or current state, without necessarily implying a process.&#10;3. Being out of somewhere, such as in &quot;I'm out of the house,&quot; refers to leaving a physical location. However, when applied to resources like film, it takes on a metaphorical meaning, indicating that one is no longer in possession of or has access to the resource.&#10;4. The phrase &quot;I'm out of film&quot; differs from alternative expressions like &quot;the film ran out&quot; or &quot;the film is out&quot; because it places more emphasis on the speaker's current state rather than focusing on the resource itself. This subtle difference in perspective can influence how the listener understands and interprets the situation.">

They touch upon the idea that certain linguistic expressions might be motivated but not strictly metaphorical, using examples like &quot;I'm in a hurry&quot; (a state) and asking about the existence of a bakery (not necessarily wanting to buy baked goods).&#10;3. Towards the end, Professor E suggests including slides from previous materials that demonstrate language analysis, matching to underlying image schemas, and construction/simulation for visual support.&#10;4. The discussion is not directly related to kitchen marks or T-shirt slogans (except for a brief humorous remark about making T-shirts), but it does involve a subject with its own life that could potentially be used in various contexts.">

This interpretation is based on the preposition &quot;out of,&quot; which can indicate departure from a state or location, and the association between &quot;having&quot; and location.&#10;2. Running out of something implies a process where the resource is depleted over time, whereas being out of film (or any other resource) focuses more on the final outcome or current state, without necessarily implying a process.&#10;3. Being out of somewhere, such as in &quot;I'm out of the house,&quot; refers to leaving a physical location. However, when applied to resources like film, it takes on a metaphorical meaning, indicating that one is no longer in possession of or has access to the resource.&#10;4. The phrase &quot;I'm out of film&quot; differs from alternative expressions like &quot;the film ran out&quot; or &quot;the film is out&quot; because it places more emphasis on the speaker's current state rather than focusing on the resource itself. This subtle difference in perspective can influence how the listener understands and interprets the situation.">

According to them, construal is the process by which users interpret and understand HTI systems in different ways. For example, a cafe can be construed as a container, an obstacle, or a physical object, depending on the context. This means that even seemingly simple interactions with HTI systems can be ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.&#10;&#10;Moreover, they suggest that construal is key to discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems because it allows users to make sense of these systems in their own terms. Even if people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less metaphorical, as Grad C suggests, construal is still a crucial factor in understanding how they engage with these systems.&#10;&#10;Professor E also highlights the interaction between analysis and construal as an important aspect of HTI systems. The &quot;double arrow&quot; he refers to may indicate the need for a two-way process of analyzing user behavior while also accounting for the different ways in which users construe the system. This suggests that designing effective HTI systems requires not only technical expertise but also an understanding of how users interpret and make sense of these systems.&#10;&#10;In short, construal plays a crucial role in discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems by allowing users to interpret and understand these systems in their own terms, and requiring designers to account for this variability in their analysis and design processes.">

This interpretation is based on the preposition &quot;out of,&quot; which can indicate departure from a state or location, and the association between &quot;having&quot; and location.&#10;2. Running out of something implies a process where the resource is depleted over time, whereas being out of film (or any other resource) focuses more on the final outcome or current state, without necessarily implying a process.&#10;3. Being out of somewhere, such as in &quot;I'm out of the house,&quot; refers to leaving a physical location. However, when applied to resources like film, it takes on a metaphorical meaning, indicating that one is no longer in possession of or has access to the resource.&#10;4. The phrase &quot;I'm out of film&quot; differs from alternative expressions like &quot;the film ran out&quot; or &quot;the film is out&quot; because it places more emphasis on the speaker's current state rather than focusing on the resource itself. This subtle difference in perspective can influence how the listener understands and interprets the situation.">

This scalability allows for basic cases, such as physical containers and paths, to be applied to metaphorical and metonymic cases, enabling new constructions or metaphors to interact and compose with all other constructions. This results in a more efficient language processing model by reducing the need for separate rules for each specific case.&#10;&#10;In the transcript, Grad C mentions that this concept is discussed in the last paragraph before section 2 on page two of the text, where the main focus is on base cases and the additional mechanism of construal is required to make these base cases applicable to metaphorical and metonymic cases.">

Phrase your question as &quot;How can I learn more about [aspect of the developmental state]?&quot; This formulation emphasizes learning and gaining insight into the subject matter, without explicitly requesting spatial details. The answer could include sources such as books, articles, or experts in the field.&#10;&#10;3. Another way to phrase your question is &quot;What are some key aspects of [topic related to the developmental state]?&quot; This formulation focuses on understanding the essential components or characteristics of the subject matter without referencing its spatial location. The response could include a list of features, concepts, or theories associated with the developmental state.&#10;&#10;4. You could also ask &quot;Who are some notable figures in [field related to the developmental state]?&quot; This question helps you identify important individuals contributing to the field, who may have written articles, books, or given speeches that provide information about the developmental state without requiring spatial knowledge.&#10;&#10;5. Lastly, consider asking &quot;What resources are available for understanding [topic related to the developmental state]?&quot; This formulation allows the respondent to suggest various materials, such as documentaries, podcasts, or online courses, which can help you learn about the subject matter without having to worry about its spatial location.">

The group briefly acknowledges that language learning is a separate issue and should not be central to the discussion.&#10;3.

According to them, construal is the process by which users interpret and understand HTI systems in different ways. For example, a cafe can be construed as a container, an obstacle, or a physical object, depending on the context. This means that even seemingly simple interactions with HTI systems can be ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.&#10;&#10;Moreover, they suggest that construal is key to discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems because it allows users to make sense of these systems in their own terms. Even if people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less metaphorical, as Grad C suggests, construal is still a crucial factor in understanding how they engage with these systems.&#10;&#10;Professor E also highlights the interaction between analysis and construal as an important aspect of HTI systems. The &quot;double arrow&quot; he refers to may indicate the need for a two-way process of analyzing user behavior while also accounting for the different ways in which users construe the system. This suggests that designing effective HTI systems requires not only technical expertise but also an understanding of how users interpret and make sense of these systems.&#10;&#10;In short, construal plays a crucial role in discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems by allowing users to interpret and understand these systems in their own terms, and requiring designers to account for this variability in their analysis and design processes.">

    <edge source="Grad C and Professor E argue that construal plays a significant role in understanding how people interact with Human-Technology Interaction (HTI) systems. According to them, construal is the process by which users interpret and understand HTI systems in different ways. For example, a cafe can be construed as a container, an obstacle, or a physical object, depending on the context. This means that even seemingly simple interactions with HTI systems can be ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.&#10;&#10;Moreover, they suggest that construal is key to discovering important aspects of human interaction with HTI systems because it allows users to make sense of these systems in their own terms. Even if people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less metaphorical, as Grad C suggests, construal is still a crucial factor in understanding how they engage with these systems.&#10;&#10;Professor E also highlights the interaction between analysis and construal as an important aspect of HTI systems.

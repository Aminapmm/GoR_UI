    <node id="Murra Foray is the first counselor at a Travelers Aid Bureau on an unnamed planet, who Cassal, the protagonist, encounters when seeking assistance to reach Tunney 21. Based on the context of the passage, several inferences can be made about Murra Foray:&#10;&#10;1. She has special knowledge and abilities: When Cassal first meets her, he senses that she is not just another salesperson but possesses unique knowledge. This is later confirmed when Dimanche reveals that Murra Foray is a Huntner, a sub-race of men from the other side of the Galaxy.&#10;2. She has a position of authority: As the first counselor, Murra Foray holds a position of power and influence at the Travelers Aid Bureau. She makes decisions about Cassal's case and sets the contribution amount he must pay to receive assistance.&#10;3. She is decisive and confident: When dealing with Cassal, Murra Foray is direct and to the point. She quickly assesses his situation and provides clear instructions on what he needs to do next.&#10;4. She may be unscrupulous: The Travelers Aid Bureau's philanthropic nature is called into question when it becomes clear that they expect a significant contribution from Cassal for their services. Murra Foray also advises him to be wary of identification forgeries, suggesting that she may be involved in illegal activities herself.&#10;5. She is efficient and organized: The Travelers Aid Bureau is presented as an efficient organization, and Murra Foray's management of Cassal's case supports this impression. She quickly assesses his needs and provides clear instructions on what he must do next. Additionally, the agency's redecoration suggests that she is focused on making a positive first impression.&#10;&#10;Overall, Murra Foray is portrayed as a knowledgeable, confident, and potentially unscrupulous individual who holds a position of authority at the Travelers Aid Bureau." />
    <node id=" thought reproachfully.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not just another salesman,&quot; he answered definitely. &quot;I have special knowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly—&quot;&#10; &#10; He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The instrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large. From the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that information at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he could get. Dimanche was his special advantage.&#10; &#10; &quot;Anyway,&quot; he finished lamely, &quot;I'm a first class engineer. I can always find something in that line.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A scientist, maybe,&quot; murmured Murra Foray. &quot;But in this part of the Milky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't yet gained practical experience.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;You'll do better as a salesman.&quot;&#10; &#10; He got up, glowering. &quot;If that's all—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot provided for that purpose as you leave.&quot;&#10; &#10; A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle, swung open. The agency was efficient.&#10;" />
    <node id=" revised his estimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he. Nothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that he was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first counselor.&#10; &#10; &quot;We're a philanthropic agency,&quot; said Murra Foray. &quot;Your case is special, though—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I understand,&quot; he said gruffly. &quot;You accept contributions.&quot;&#10; &#10; She nodded. &quot;If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that you'll have to compromise your standard of living.&quot; But she named a sum that would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any appreciable time.&#10; &#10; He stared at her unhappily. &quot;I suppose it's worth it. I can always work, if I have to.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;As a salesman?&quot; she asked. &quot;I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do business with Godolphians.&quot;&#10; &#10; Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not just another salesman,&quot; he answered definitely. &quot;I have special knowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly—&quot;" />
    <node id=" peered.&#10; &#10; &quot;You stuck here, too?&quot; he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.&#10; &#10; &quot;Stuck?&quot; repeated Cassal. &quot;I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting for my ship.&quot; He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.&#10;&quot;Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency. Why did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency were new.&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man chuckled. &quot;Re-organization. The previous first counselor resigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one didn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.&quot;&#10; &#10; She would do just that, thought Cassal. &quot;What about this Murra Foray?&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed overcome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.&#10; &#10; Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job, afraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He shrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but" />
    <node id=" his loss. It contained more money than his wallet had.&#10; &#10; Except for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it was more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece of plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he now had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for another tab.&#10; &#10; A white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell. Curiously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word, STAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling precariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the door disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The technician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed on the door.&#10; &#10; &#10; TRAVELERS AID BUREAU Murra Foray, First Counselor&#10; &#10; It was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The old technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.&#10; &#10; With a sinking feeling" />
    <node id=" purpose as you leave.&quot;&#10; &#10; A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle, swung open. The agency was efficient.&#10; &#10; &quot;Remember,&quot; the counselor called out as he left, &quot;identification is hard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.&quot;&#10; &#10; He didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was also eminently practical.&#10; &#10; The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable contribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the bureau.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've got it,&quot; said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the first counselor had named.&#10; &#10; &quot;Got what?&quot; asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle, attached his name, and dropped it into the chute.&#10; &#10; &quot;The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's a Huntner?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing about her home planet when I managed to locate her.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Any other information?&quot;" />
    <node id=" a few days on Godolph. I've been here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney&#10;21.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just a moment.&quot; She glanced at something below the angle of the screen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. &quot; Rickrock C arrived yesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Departed?&quot; He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. &quot;When will the next ship arrive?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?&quot; she asked.&#10; &#10; He didn't answer.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; she said. &quot;Billions. Tunney, according to the notation, is near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've covered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything within a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer distances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly, Cassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on or near Godolph. Within the next five years—maybe.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He blanched." />
    <node id="Dimanche suggests that Cassal should turn to the &quot;godawful&quot; (presumably a typo and should be &quot;Godolph&quot;) police because of his limitations as a device. Although he can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and report what a person says or subvocalizes, he cannot read minds. Therefore, he may not be able to provide Cassal with the exact reason why someone wants to kill him, but the police might have a better chance of investigating and finding out through their resources. However, as we see in the story, Cassal has reasons to avoid involving the police and prefers to handle the situation himself." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;Correction,&quot; said Dimanche. &quot;Not simple assault. He has murder in mind.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It still doesn't appeal to me,&quot; said Cassal. Striving to look unconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and stared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside, he might find safety for a time.&#10; &#10; Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude him in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the streets would be brightly lighted—for native eyes. A human would consider it dim.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why did he choose me?&quot; asked Cassal plaintively. &quot;There must be something he hopes to gain.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm working on it,&quot; said Dimanche. &quot;But remember, I have limitations. At short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report what a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in finding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem over to the godawful police.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;God" />
    <node id="'re really interested in finding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem over to the godawful police.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Godolph, not godawful,&quot; corrected Cassal absently.&#10; &#10; That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give the police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various reasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called Dimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own, say, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the proper approach, either.&#10; &#10; &quot;Weapons?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long knife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.&quot;&#10; &#10; Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in semantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could die from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of protection himself.&#10; &#10; &quot;Report,&quot; said Dimanche. &quot;Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on tenuous evidence.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Let's have it anyway.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=", of course, but would the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to investigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would question him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what could he do about it?&#10; &#10; Suppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney&#10;21?&#10; &#10; Grimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of this. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know,&quot; replied Dimanche irritably. &quot;I can interpret body data—a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.&quot;&#10; &#10; Cassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles of no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount of money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A picture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which resembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.&#10; &#10; Cassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed to be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of getting to Tunney 21.&#10; " />
    <node id="erment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed to be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of getting to Tunney 21.&#10; &#10; Right now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the boulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.&#10; &#10; He bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him. Before he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly trying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he was forced to the ground.&#10; &#10; He threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps rushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping by way of water.&#10; &#10; Whoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in sight.&#10; &#10; &quot;Interpret body data, do you?&quot; muttered Cassal. &quot;Liveliest dead man I've ever been strangled by.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the basic functions of their body,&quot; said Dimanche defensively. &quot;When I checked him, he had no heartbeat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Remind me not to" />
    <node id=" men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing about her home planet when I managed to locate her.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Any other information?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached her. I got out as fast as I could.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I see.&quot; The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless, it sounded depressing.&#10; &#10; &quot;What I want to know is,&quot; said Dimanche, &quot;why such precautions as electronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?&quot;&#10; &#10; Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly inquisitive at times.&#10; &#10; Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on the other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man was staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed every sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was removing the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him. He turned and peered.&#10; &#10; &quot;You stuck here, too?&quot; he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.&#10; &#10; &quot;Stuck?&quot; repeated Cass" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;None at all,&quot; admitted Dimanche. &quot;He's very close. You'd better turn around.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Cassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him feel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.&#10; &#10; A dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the alley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant shot by.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey!&quot; shouted Cassal.&#10; &#10; Echoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling that no one was going to come to his assistance.&#10; &#10; &quot;He wasn't expecting that reaction,&quot; explained Dimanche. &quot;That's why he missed. He's turned around and is coming back.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm armed!&quot; shouted Cassal.&#10; &#10; &quot;That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Cassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few seconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected stiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical instrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its function, converting" />
    <node id="Based on the story, it can be inferred that the old man at Travelers Aid appeared afraid when asked about &quot;Murra Foray&quot; because he was afraid of losing his job or facing other consequences under the new leadership of Murra Foray. The old man mentioned a re-organization of the agency, which could suggest that Murra Foray is implementing changes and may be scrutinizing the actions of the agency's employees. The old man's behavior could indicate that there is a culture of fear or uncertainty among the staff at Travelers Aid under Murra Foray's leadership." />
    <node id=" the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He shrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but he didn't intend to depend on that alone." />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Sometimes regulations are silly,&quot; said Cassal firmly. &quot;Let me speak to the first counselor.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You are speaking to her,&quot; she said. Her face disappeared from the screen.&#10; &#10; Cassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.&#10; &#10; Travelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly supplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him, Cassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of him. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and answers. One thing he drew the line at—why he wanted to go to Tunney&#10;21 was his own business.&#10; &#10; The first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed, that anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average, rather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the chin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She glanced down at the data. &quot;Denton Cassal, native of Earth. Destination, Tunney 21.&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;Occupation, sales engineer. Isn't that an odd combination?&quot; Her smile was quite superior." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it seems that Cassal might be facing the danger of being assaulted or even murdered by someone who is following him. According to Dimanche, the person has murder in mind and not just simple assault. This is confirmed when Cassal overhears a conversation between two Godolphians speculating about whether the human was pushed into the water or if it was an accident, indicating that there might have been an attempt on his life. Additionally, Cassal's awareness of his vulnerability as a human in a city designed for Godolphians, where he would stand out and be easily targeted, further highlights the potential danger he is in." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;First you have to get there,&quot; Dimanche pointed out. &quot;I mean, is it safe for a stranger to walk through the city?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now that you mention it, no,&quot; answered Cassal. He looked around apprehensively. &quot;Where is he?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise display.&quot;&#10; &#10; A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was accustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple bobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all travelers were crazy.&#10; &#10; Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk. It would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he could walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?&#10; &#10; A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was peculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was at a definite disadvantage.&#10; &#10; &quot;Correction,&quot; said Dimanche. &quot;Not simple assault. He has murder in mind.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It still doesn't appeal to me" />
    <node id=" &quot;That's one way of finding out,&quot; said Cassal. &quot;But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on getting back to the hotel?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm curious. Turn here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Go to hell,&quot; said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that intersection, he turned there.&#10; &#10; It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily slow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on the other.&#10; &#10; He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all very well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was also the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an electronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.&#10; &#10; &quot;Easy,&quot; warned Dimanche. &quot;He's at the entrance to the alley, walking fast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm surprised, too,&quot; remarked Cassal. &quot;But I wouldn't say I'm pleased. Not just now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.&quot; The mechanism concealed within his body was silent for an instant and" />
    <node id=" Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely flexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the ribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout the city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly and noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human—Cassal shivered. If he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No investigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had certainly picked the right place.&#10; &#10; The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal was almost positive she muttered a polite &quot;Arf?&quot; as she sloshed by. What she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.&#10; &#10; &quot;Follow her,&quot; instructed Dimanche. &quot;We've got to investigate our man at closer range.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive in an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful out of her element, though.&#10; &#10; The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal retraced his steps. A man, or" />
    <node id="The first counselor referred to in the text is a woman who is in charge of providing assistance to Cassal at the Travelers Aid agency. It is unclear to Cassal why she should be his counselor because he initially requested to speak with the first counselor, assuming that it was a different person. However, it is later revealed that the woman herself is the first counselor. The text also mentions that there was a recent change in leadership at the agency, which may contribute to Cassal's confusion. Additionally, the first counselor seems to have a superior and distant demeanor, which could make it difficult for Cassal to connect with her on a personal level." />
    <node id=" then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The old technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.&#10; &#10; With a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed help and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.&#10; &#10; Inside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a maze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable. Travelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he managed to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.&#10; &#10; A woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. &quot;Please answer everything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be available for consultation.&quot;&#10; &#10; Cassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. &quot;Is this necessary?&quot; he asked. &quot;It's merely a matter of information.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We have certain regulations we abide by.&quot; The woman smiled frostily.&#10;&quot;I can't give you any information until you comply with them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sometimes regulations are silly,&quot; said Cassal firmly. &quot;Let me speak to the first counselor.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You are speaking to her,&quot; she" />
    <node id="The story suggests that the electronic guards were in place to protect the woman from another galaxy, who was being assisted by the Travelers Aid agency. The reason for such secrecy around the agency's activities is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is mentioned that the agency recently underwent a re-organization and that the first counselor, Murra Foray, is implementing changes. It is possible that the agency's work with extraterrestrial beings is confidential or sensitive in nature, which could explain the need for security measures and discretion. Additionally, the old man at the agency seemed afraid to speak about Murra Foray, suggesting that there may be consequences for disclosing information about the agency's activities." />
    <node id="The story suggests that Cassal's assailant was not deterred by the fact that Cassal claimed to be armed because he didn't believe him. When Cassal shouted &quot;I'm armed!&quot;, Dimanche explains that it won't stop his attacker because he doesn't believe him. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as Cassal's demeanor or the fact that his assailant may have underestimated him. Additionally, the assailant may have been so determined to carry out his attack that he was not willing to take any chances, even if it meant confronting an armed opponent. It's also possible that the assailant believed that he could overpower Cassal despite his weapon." />
    <node id=" the basic functions of their body,&quot; said Dimanche defensively. &quot;When I checked him, he had no heartbeat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,&quot; grunted Cassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't wanted to kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the police.&#10; &#10; He needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second time he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was successful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He squeezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.&#10; &#10; Something, however, was missing—his wallet.&#10; &#10; The thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle. Persistent fellow. Damned persistent.&#10; &#10; It really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the supposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police. Now he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It contained more money than his wallet had.&#10; &#10; Except for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it was more than a" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Attack!&quot; howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. &quot;You've got him. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's afraid.&quot;&#10; &#10; Attack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some didn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent fell to the ground, gasped and was silent.&#10; &#10; Cassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near the water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't move.&#10; &#10; &quot;Heartbeat slow,&quot; said Dimanche solemnly. &quot;Breathing barely perceptible.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then he's not dead,&quot; said Cassal in relief.&#10; &#10; Foam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed from cuts on the face.&#10; &#10; &quot;Respiration none, heartbeat absent,&quot; stated Dimanche.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Horrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but would the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to investigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And" />
    <node id="The first counselor is a woman at the Travelers Aid agency who is responsible for providing assistance to Cassal. Her role is significant because she is helping Cassal with his situation, which involves finding out information and receiving aid for an unknown threat towards him. Despite his initial confusion about her identity and their frosty interaction, the first counselor provides necessary resources and regulations to help him. The agency's recent change in leadership and the first counselor's enigmatic demeanor add intrigue to her character. Her role becomes more crucial as Cassal decides to handle his situation independently, rather than seeking help from the police." />
    <node id="1. Cassal can't follow the advice to turn the matter over to the police mainly because of the limitations of his device, Dimanche, and concerns related to involving the law. He can't provide any evidence to the police except through Dimanche, which he wants to exclude from the situation for unspecified reasons. Additionally, the police would only act if they found a body, which is not an appealing option for Cassal.&#10;2. The person who wants to kill Cassal was found carrying a long knife and a hard striking object, both concealed on his person. These items are considered weapons that pose a serious threat to Cassal's safety." />
    <node id="1. There are several factors that might make it worthwhile for Cassal to investigate further the situation regarding the person he had regarded as good as dead:&#10;* The person's motivation is connected somehow with Cassal's being marooned on Godolph, which suggests that there may be a way to resolve his delay and continue on his journey.&#10;* While Dimanche mentioned that the evidence is tenuous, it could still provide valuable clues about who wants to harm Cassal and why.&#10;* Even if the police might not be involved due to lack of a body or concrete evidence, Cassal can still gather information unofficially through his own investigation.&#10;1. The weather-controlled planet of Godolph and its rainy climate affect Cassal's experience in several ways:&#10;* As a traveler from Earth, he is not adapted to the constant rain and may find it uncomfortable or even depressing.&#10;* The native inhabitants, who have engineering abilities to control the weather, are likely accustomed to the rain and may have developed technologies and architectural designs that cater to the climate. This could make Cassal stand out further as a human among Godolphians, increasing his vulnerability and potential target status.&#10;* However, the fact that the Godolphians can control the weather also suggests advanced engineering abilities that might be worth investigating or learning from. It's possible that there are useful technologies or insights to be gained from studying their weather-control systems.&#10;* Overall, the rainy climate of Godolph serves as a backdrop for Cassal's investigation and adds to the atmosphere of unease and potential danger in his interactions with the natives." />
    <node id=",&quot; said Dimanche. &quot;Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on tenuous evidence.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Let's have it anyway.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For some reason you can't get off this planet.&quot;&#10; &#10; That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand star systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.&#10; &#10; Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a transfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he had left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here. He hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't unusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as reliable as they might be.&#10; &#10; Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with that delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was self-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself. He was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched" />
    <node id="The story does not provide the man's real name, as it is not revealed in the text. However, the fact that Cassal remembers his name suggests that they may have had a previous relationship or encounter, which could be why the man's motivation for attacking Cassal is connected to Cassal's being marooned on Godolph. This information could potentially help Cassal resolve his delay and continue on his journey. The significance of remembering the man's name is that it suggests a personal connection between them, rather than a random attack by a stranger. Even if the police may not be involved in investigating the situation due to lack of evidence, Cassal can still gather information unofficially through his own investigation." />
    <node id="1. Physical danger from the unknown person following him: The story suggests that the person trailing Cassal poses a serious threat to his safety, as they are carrying weapons and have murderous intentions. Cassal is aware of this danger and is understandably nervous about it.&#10;&#10;2. Risking further attention by turning into the dark alley: By following Dimanche's advice and turning into the alley, Cassal may be putting himself in more danger, as he is isolating himself from potential help and making himself an easier target for his pursuer.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing Dimanche's curiosity with his own safety: While Dimanche is primarily concerned with gathering information, Cassal must also consider his own well-being. He acknowledges that even subvocalized conversation can be distracting and dangerous in this situation, demonstrating the tension between satisfying Dimanche's curiosity and ensuring his own survival.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding involvement of the police: As mentioned earlier, Cassal has reasons for not wanting to involve the police, which may limit his options for dealing with the threat he faces. This adds another layer of complexity to his situation, as he must navigate this danger without the assistance of law enforcement.&#10;&#10;5. Trust issues with the first counselor at the Travelers Aid agency: While the first counselor is providing necessary resources and information, Cassal is initially skeptical of her intentions due to her enigmatic demeanor and the recent change in leadership at the agency. This may impact his willingness to seek help from this source, further limiting his options for addressing the threat he faces.&#10;&#10;In summary, Cassal is balancing several dangers as he navigates the dark alley while being trailed by an unknown person, including physical harm, increased isolation, satisfying Dimanche's curiosity, avoiding police involvement, and dealing with trust issues related to the Travelers Aid agency." />
    <node id="The story does not provide information about the outcome of Cassal's job interview. However, during the interaction with Murra Foray at the Travelers Aid agency, it is revealed that Cassal has special knowledge and skills as a sales engineer, which he plans to utilize on Tunney 21. Based on this special knowledge, Murra Foray makes an inference about his purpose for traveling to Tunney 21, guessing that he wants to study under the best scientists in the galaxy. However, Cassal corrects her and reveals that he is going there to meet a relatively obscure research worker whom Neuronics wants on their staff. This exchange highlights how Cassal's special knowledge and skills are considered valuable and have influenced Murra Foray's perception of his intentions for traveling to Tunney 21." />
    <node id=" Destination, Tunney 21.&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;Occupation, sales engineer. Isn't that an odd combination?&quot; Her smile was quite superior.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not at all.

They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study under them.&quot;&#10; &#10; Close—but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not necessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could build Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even less likely.&#10; &#10; There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21 that Neuronics wanted on their staff.

Additionally, the police would only act if they found a body, which is not an appealing option for Cassal (Story).&#10;2. The person who wants to kill Cassal was found carrying a long knife and a hard striking object, both concealed on his person. These items are considered weapons that pose a serious threat to Cassal's safety (Story). When Cassal shouted &quot;I'm armed!&quot;, Dimanche explains that it won't stop his attacker because he doesn't believe him, which could be due to various reasons such as Cassal's demeanor or the fact that his assailant may have underestimated him. The assailant may have been so determined to carry out his attack that he was not willing to take any chances, even if it meant confronting an armed opponent (Story)." />
    <node id="Cassal is instructed to follow the Godolphian girl by Dimanche so that they can investigate their target at a closer range. This reveals that their mission involves gathering information and observing the behavior of the individuals they are interested in. By following the girl, Cassal and Dimanche hope to learn more about the man who had previously threatened Cassal and understand his motivations for wanting to harm him. This approach allows them to conduct an unofficial investigation without relying on the police, as Cassal has reasons to avoid involving law enforcement. Additionally, following the girl may provide insights into the broader social dynamics of the Godolphian society, helping Cassal navigate the city more effectively and avoid potential danger." />
    <node id="1. Use decoys or misdirection: Cassal could use a decoy, such as having someone else walk in front of him to draw the assailant's attention away from him temporarily. This might help Cassal identify and confirm his suspicions about being followed while minimizing risk to himself.&#10;&#10;2. Create distance and observe from afar: Given that the would-be assassin's face appears meek and out of character for a violent person, it may be worthwhile for Cassal to put some distance between them and observe the man without being noticed. This will allow him to gather more information about the individual and confirm whether he is truly following Cassal with ill intentions.&#10;&#10;3. Establish a safe location or escape route: Before attempting any direct confrontation, Cassal should ensure his safety by locating a well-populated area or establishing an easy escape route. This could deter the assailant from carrying out an attack and provide Cassal with the ability to quickly flee if necessary.&#10;&#10;4. Maintain situational awareness: In order to minimize risk, Cassal should be mindful of his surroundings at all times. He should pay attention to potential threats, such as hidden corners or dark alleys where an assailant might lie in wait. Being aware of his environment will allow Cassal to make informed decisions and react quickly if needed.&#10;&#10;5. Consider involving the Godolph police: As Dimanche suggested, the police might have resources at their disposal that could help Cassal confirm whether he is being followed with ill intentions and ensure his safety. Although Cassal may prefer not to involve law enforcement for personal reasons, it's essential to weigh the potential risks against the benefits of seeking professional assistance." />
    <node id=" of her element, though.&#10; &#10; The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal retraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow, physically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with it. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A scientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.&#10; &#10; &quot;Nothing,&quot; said Dimanche disgustedly. &quot;His mind froze when we got close. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed. Anticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans. That makes the knife definite.&quot;&#10; &#10; Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal stopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.&#10; &#10; &quot;Excellent thinking,&quot; commended Dimanche. &quot;He won't attempt anything on this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted intersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.&quot;&#10; &#10; The lighter flared in his hand. &quot;That's one way of finding out,&quot; said Cassal. &quot;But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on getting back to the hotel" />
    <node id="Based on the information from the story, it is uncertain when another ship bound for Tunney will be available at Godolph.

If the fragments of his studies that had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he could help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that could build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag could set its own price, which could be control of all communications, transport, trade—a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of all that.&#10; &#10; His part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher to come to Earth, if he could . Literally, he had to guess the Tunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition, the reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their arrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working for ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as Dimanche was a key factor.&#10; &#10; Her voice broke through his thoughts. &quot;Now, then, what's your problem?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've been here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney&#10;21.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, it would be challenging for Cassal and Dimanche to justify their actions as a case of self-defense if they were to use force against the man carrying the knife and hard striking object. The man has not yet attempted to harm them, and merely possessing weapons is not sufficient grounds for self-defense. Moreover, the story mentions that the man's weapons are concealed on his person, which could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid drawing attention to them, rather than actively threatening Cassal or Dimanche.&#10;&#10;If Cassal were to harm or kill the man based on this information alone, he risks being seen as the aggressor in the situation and may face legal consequences as a result. The police would likely view the use of force as unnecessary and disproportionate to the threat posed by the man.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is advisable for Cassal and Dimanche to avoid confrontation with the man and seek alternative ways to ensure their safety. This could include informing the police about the man's threatening behavior and weapons, or finding a way to protect themselves without resorting to violence." />
    <node id="1. After realizing that his wallet has been stolen and the &quot;dead&quot; body has a significant amount of money in its clip, Cassal decides to keep the clip as compensation for his loss. The clip contains more money than his wallet had. He also concludes that it's a fair exchange, except for the identification tab he always carries in his wallet, which is not essential for him at the moment since he has enough money and can request another tab if needed.&#10;2. Cassal feels compelled to investigate the situation further because of the uncertainty surrounding the thug's motives and the missing wallet. He lays down the rapier and begins questioning Dimanche about any possible connection between this dead man and his mission, but finds no clear link.&#10;3. In summary, Cassal decides to keep the clip with money as compensation for his stolen wallet and resolves to investigate the situation further due to unanswered questions about the thug's motives and missing possessions." />
    <node id="1. Cassal received instructions to follow the Godolphian girl so that he and Dimanche could investigate their target at a closer range, which reveals that their mission involves gathering information and observing the behavior of the individuals they are interested in. By following the girl, they hope to learn more about the man who had previously threatened Cassal and understand his motivations for wanting to harm him. This approach allows them to conduct an unofficial investigation without relying on the police, as Cassal has reasons to avoid involving law enforcement. Additionally, following the girl may provide insights into the broader social dynamics of the Godolphian society, helping Cassal navigate the city more effectively and avoid potential danger.&#10;&#10;2. Based on the description given, the Girl is a native Godophian who is being followed by Cassal at the instruction of Dimanche. The text does not provide any further information about her appearance, personality, or role in the story beyond serving as a means for Cassal to observe and investigate his potential assailant. As such, it would be speculative to make any definitive conclusions about her without additional context." />
    <node id="1. Dimanche suspected that the man following Cassal had murderous intentions based on the weapons he was carrying, a long knife and a hard striking object, which were concealed on his person. These items suggested that the man was prepared for violence and posed a serious threat to Cassal's safety (Story).&#10;2. Dimanche suggests that Cassal should turn to the &quot;godawful&quot; (presumably a typo and should be &quot;Godolph&quot;) police because of his limitations as a device. Although he can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and report what a person says or subvocalizes, he cannot read minds. Therefore, Dimanche may not be able to provide Cassal with the exact reason why someone wants to kill him, but the police might have a better chance of investigating and finding out through their resources (Story). However, as we see in the story, Cassal has reasons to avoid involving the police and prefers to handle the situation himself." />
    <node id="1. Based on the information provided in the story, Dimanche and Cassal's plan to determine if the man is still following them involves leading him down a deserted intersection using a cigarette as a decoy. Specifically, Cassal takes a drag from his cigarette and then walks down a less crowded street, hoping that the smoke will attract the attention of anyone who might be following them. Dimanche suggests this plan because they are currently in an area with heavy foot traffic, which makes it difficult for them to determine if the man is still tailing them. By leading him down a deserted intersection, they can more easily confirm whether or not he is still following them.&#10;2. The reason why Cassal and Dimanche choose to use a cigarette as a decoy may be related to its distinctive smell, which can linger in the air and potentially attract the attention of someone who is nearby. Additionally, smoking is a common activity that people do while walking, so using a cigarette as a decoy would not seem out of place or suspicious. By taking a drag from his cigarette and then walking down a less crowded street, Cassal can create a noticeable scent trail that the man following them might be drawn to, allowing Dimanche and Cassal to confirm his presence.&#10;&#10;Overall, Dimanche and Cassal's plan is a strategic move to confirm whether or not they are being followed and ensure their safety. By leading the potential pursuer down a deserted intersection with the help of a cigarette, they can more easily detect his presence and take appropriate action if necessary." />

Additionally, the fact that Cassal remembers his name suggests a personal connection or history between them, which could be related to Cassal being marooned on Godolph.&#10;2. Turning the problem over to the &quot;godawful&quot; (presumably a typo and should be &quot;Godolph&quot;) police might help uncover the reason for the person's desire to kill Cassal because the police have resources and investigative capabilities that Cassal and his device, Dimanche, do not. While Dimanche can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and report what a person says or subvocalizes, it cannot read minds and may not be able to provide Cassal with the exact reason for the threat on his life. The police, however, could potentially investigate and discover the motive behind the threat through their own means. However, as mentioned in the story, Cassal has reasons to avoid involving the police and prefers to handle the situation himself." />
    <node id="1. Cassal is instructed to follow the Godolphian girl by Dimanche so that they can investigate their target at a closer range, which reveals that their mission involves gathering information and observing the behavior of the individuals they are interested in. By following the girl, they hope to learn more about the man who had previously threatened Cassal and understand his motivations for wanting to harm him. This approach allows them to conduct an unofficial investigation without relying on the police, as Cassal has reasons to avoid involving law enforcement. Additionally, following the girl may provide insights into the broader social dynamics of the Godolphian society, helping Cassal navigate the city more effectively and avoid potential danger. &#10;&#10;In summary, Cassal is following the Godolphian girl in order to get closer to their target (the man who threatened him) and gather information about him. This unofficial investigation method helps Cassal avoid involving the police and potentially learn more about the social dynamics of the Godolphian society." />

The weather-controlled planet of Godolph and its rainy climate affect Cassal's experience in several ways:&#10;* As a traveler from Earth, he is not adapted to the constant rain and may find it uncomfortable or even depressing.&#10;* The native inhabitants, who have engineering abilities to control the weather, are likely accustomed to the rain and may have developed technologies and architectural designs that cater to the climate.

Physical danger from the unknown person following him: The story suggests that the person trailing Cassal poses a serious threat to his safety, as they are carrying weapons and have murderous intentions. Cassal is aware of this danger and is understandably nervous about it.&#10;&#10;2. Risking further attention by turning into the dark alley: By following Dimanche's advice and turning into the alley, Cassal may be putting himself in more danger, as he is isolating himself from potential help and making himself an easier target for his pursuer.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing Dimanche's curiosity with his own safety: While Dimanche is primarily concerned with gathering information, Cassal must also consider his own well-being. He acknowledges that even subvocalized conversation can be distracting and dangerous in this situation, demonstrating the tension between satisfying Dimanche's curiosity and ensuring his own survival.&#10;&#10;4.

This adds another layer of complexity to his situation, as he must navigate this danger without the assistance of law enforcement.&#10;&#10;5. Trust issues with the first counselor at the Travelers Aid agency: While the first counselor is providing necessary resources and information, Cassal is initially skeptical of her intentions due to her enigmatic demeanor and the recent change in leadership at the agency.

Create distance and observe from afar: Given that the would-be assassin's face appears meek and out of character for a violent person, it may be worthwhile for Cassal to put some distance between them and observe the man without being noticed. This will allow him to gather more information about the individual and confirm whether he is truly following Cassal with ill intentions.&#10;&#10;3. Establish a safe location or escape route: Before attempting any direct confrontation, Cassal should ensure his safety by locating a well-populated area or establishing an easy escape route. This could deter the assailant from carrying out an attack and provide Cassal with the ability to quickly flee if necessary.&#10;&#10;4. Maintain situational awareness: In order to minimize risk, Cassal should be mindful of his surroundings at all times. He should pay attention to potential threats, such as hidden corners or dark alleys where an assailant might lie in wait. Being aware of his environment will allow Cassal to make informed decisions and react quickly if needed.&#10;&#10;5. Consider involving the Godolph police: As Dimanche suggested, the police might have resources at their disposal that could help Cassal confirm whether he is being followed with ill intentions and ensure his safety. Although Cassal may prefer not to involve law enforcement for personal reasons, it's essential to weigh the potential risks against the benefits of seeking professional assistance.">

Moreover, the story mentions that the man's weapons are concealed on his person, which could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid drawing attention to them, rather than actively threatening Cassal or Dimanche.&#10;&#10;If Cassal were to harm or kill the man based on this information alone, he risks being seen as the aggressor in the situation and may face legal consequences as a result.

Based on the information provided in the story, Dimanche and Cassal's plan to determine if the man is still following them involves leading him down a deserted intersection using a cigarette as a decoy. Specifically, Cassal takes a drag from his cigarette and then walks down a less crowded street, hoping that the smoke will attract the attention of anyone who might be following them. Dimanche suggests this plan because they are currently in an area with heavy foot traffic, which makes it difficult for them to determine if the man is still tailing them. By leading him down a deserted intersection, they can more easily confirm whether or not he is still following them.&#10;2. The reason why Cassal and Dimanche choose to use a cigarette as a decoy may be related to its distinctive smell, which can linger in the air and potentially attract the attention of someone who is nearby. Additionally, smoking is a common activity that people do while walking, so using a cigarette as a decoy would not seem out of place or suspicious.

When Cassal shouted &quot;I'm armed!&quot;, Dimanche explains that it won't stop his attacker because he doesn't believe him, which could be due to various reasons such as Cassal's demeanor or the fact that his assailant may have underestimated him. The assailant may have been so determined to carry out his attack that he was not willing to take any chances, even if it meant confronting an armed opponent (Story).">

Moreover, the story mentions that the man's weapons are concealed on his person, which could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid drawing attention to them, rather than actively threatening Cassal or Dimanche.&#10;&#10;If Cassal were to harm or kill the man based on this information alone, he risks being seen as the aggressor in the situation and may face legal consequences as a result. The police would likely view the use of force as unnecessary and disproportionate to the threat posed by the man.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is advisable for Cassal and Dimanche to avoid confrontation with the man and seek alternative ways to ensure their safety. This could include informing the police about the man's threatening behavior and weapons, or finding a way to protect themselves without resorting to violence.">

Additionally, Cassal's awareness of his vulnerability as a human in a city designed for Godolphians, where he would stand out and be easily targeted, further highlights the potential danger he is in." target="1. Physical danger from the unknown person following him: The story suggests that the person trailing Cassal poses a serious threat to his safety, as they are carrying weapons and have murderous intentions. Cassal is aware of this danger and is understandably nervous about it.&#10;&#10;2. Risking further attention by turning into the dark alley: By following Dimanche's advice and turning into the alley, Cassal may be putting himself in more danger, as he is isolating himself from potential help and making himself an easier target for his pursuer.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing Dimanche's curiosity with his own safety: While Dimanche is primarily concerned with gathering information, Cassal must also consider his own well-being. He acknowledges that even subvocalized conversation can be distracting and dangerous in this situation, demonstrating the tension between satisfying Dimanche's curiosity and ensuring his own survival.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding involvement of the police: As mentioned earlier, Cassal has reasons for not wanting to involve the police, which may limit his options for dealing with the threat he faces. This adds another layer of complexity to his situation, as he must navigate this danger without the assistance of law enforcement.&#10;&#10;5. Trust issues with the first counselor at the Travelers Aid agency: While the first counselor is providing necessary resources and information, Cassal is initially skeptical of her intentions due to her enigmatic demeanor and the recent change in leadership at the agency. This may impact his willingness to seek help from this source, further limiting his options for addressing the threat he faces.&#10;&#10;In summary, Cassal is balancing several dangers as he navigates the dark alley while being trailed by an unknown person, including physical harm, increased isolation, satisfying Dimanche's curiosity, avoiding police involvement, and dealing with trust issues related to the Travelers Aid agency.">

Based on this special knowledge, Murra Foray makes an inference about his purpose for traveling to Tunney 21, guessing that he wants to study under the best scientists in the galaxy. However, Cassal corrects her and reveals that he is going there to meet a relatively obscure research worker whom Neuronics wants on their staff.

These items are considered weapons that pose a serious threat to Cassal's safety (Story). When Cassal shouted &quot;I'm armed!&quot;, Dimanche explains that it won't stop his attacker because he doesn't believe him, which could be due to various reasons such as Cassal's demeanor or the fact that his assailant may have underestimated him. The assailant may have been so determined to carry out his attack that he was not willing to take any chances, even if it meant confronting an armed opponent (Story).">

Create distance and observe from afar: Given that the would-be assassin's face appears meek and out of character for a violent person, it may be worthwhile for Cassal to put some distance between them and observe the man without being noticed. This will allow him to gather more information about the individual and confirm whether he is truly following Cassal with ill intentions.&#10;&#10;3.

This could deter the assailant from carrying out an attack and provide Cassal with the ability to quickly flee if necessary.&#10;&#10;4. Maintain situational awareness: In order to minimize risk, Cassal should be mindful of his surroundings at all times.

Dimanche suggests that Cassal should turn to the &quot;godawful&quot; (presumably a typo and should be &quot;Godolph&quot;) police because of his limitations as a device. Although he can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and report what a person says or subvocalizes, he cannot read minds. Therefore, Dimanche may not be able to provide Cassal with the exact reason why someone wants to kill him, but the police might have a better chance of investigating and finding out through their resources (Story).

Based on the information provided in the story, Dimanche and Cassal's plan to determine if the man is still following them involves leading him down a deserted intersection using a cigarette as a decoy. Specifically, Cassal takes a drag from his cigarette and then walks down a less crowded street, hoping that the smoke will attract the attention of anyone who might be following them. Dimanche suggests this plan because they are currently in an area with heavy foot traffic, which makes it difficult for them to determine if the man is still tailing them. By leading him down a deserted intersection, they can more easily confirm whether or not he is still following them.&#10;2. The reason why Cassal and Dimanche choose to use a cigarette as a decoy may be related to its distinctive smell, which can linger in the air and potentially attract the attention of someone who is nearby. Additionally, smoking is a common activity that people do while walking, so using a cigarette as a decoy would not seem out of place or suspicious. By taking a drag from his cigarette and then walking down a less crowded street, Cassal can create a noticeable scent trail that the man following them might be drawn to, allowing Dimanche and Cassal to confirm his presence.&#10;&#10;Overall, Dimanche and Cassal's plan is a strategic move to confirm whether or not they are being followed and ensure their safety. By leading the potential pursuer down a deserted intersection with the help of a cigarette, they can more easily detect his presence and take appropriate action if necessary.">

The weather-controlled planet of Godolph and its rainy climate affect Cassal's experience in several ways:&#10;* As a traveler from Earth, he is not adapted to the constant rain and may find it uncomfortable or even depressing.&#10;* The native inhabitants, who have engineering abilities to control the weather, are likely accustomed to the rain and may have developed technologies and architectural designs that cater to the climate. This could make Cassal stand out further as a human among Godolphians, increasing his vulnerability and potential target status.&#10;* However, the fact that the Godolphians can control the weather also suggests advanced engineering abilities that might be worth investigating or learning from. It's possible that there are useful technologies or insights to be gained from studying their weather-control systems.&#10;* Overall, the rainy climate of Godolph serves as a backdrop for Cassal's investigation and adds to the atmosphere of unease and potential danger in his interactions with the natives.">

Create distance and observe from afar: Given that the would-be assassin's face appears meek and out of character for a violent person, it may be worthwhile for Cassal to put some distance between them and observe the man without being noticed.

    <edge source="The first counselor is a woman at the Travelers Aid agency who is responsible for providing assistance to Cassal. Her role is significant because she is helping Cassal with his situation, which involves finding out information and receiving aid for an unknown threat towards him. Despite his initial confusion about her identity and their frosty interaction, the first counselor provides necessary resources and regulations to help him. The agency's recent change in leadership and the first counselor's enigmatic demeanor add intrigue to her character. Her role becomes more crucial as Cassal decides to handle his situation independently, rather than seeking help from the police." target="1. The story does not provide explicit information on why the person following Cassal wants to kill him. However, it is mentioned that this individual was carrying weapons and had previously threatened Cassal. Additionally, the fact that Cassal remembers his name suggests a personal connection or history between them, which could be related to Cassal being marooned on Godolph.&#10;2. Turning the problem over to the &quot;godawful&quot; (presumably a typo and should be &quot;Godolph&quot;) police might help uncover the reason for the person's desire to kill Cassal because the police have resources and investigative capabilities that Cassal and his device, Dimanche, do not. While Dimanche can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and report what a person says or subvocalizes, it cannot read minds and may not be able to provide Cassal with the exact reason for the threat on his life. The police, however, could potentially investigate and discover the motive behind the threat through their own means. However, as mentioned in the story, Cassal has reasons to avoid involving the police and prefers to handle the situation himself.">

The weather-controlled planet of Godolph and its rainy climate affect Cassal's experience in several ways:&#10;* As a traveler from Earth, he is not adapted to the constant rain and may find it uncomfortable or even depressing.&#10;* The native inhabitants, who have engineering abilities to control the weather, are likely accustomed to the rain and may have developed technologies and architectural designs that cater to the climate. This could make Cassal stand out further as a human among Godolphians, increasing his vulnerability and potential target status.&#10;* However, the fact that the Godolphians can control the weather also suggests advanced engineering abilities that might be worth investigating or learning from. It's possible that there are useful technologies or insights to be gained from studying their weather-control systems.&#10;* Overall, the rainy climate of Godolph serves as a backdrop for Cassal's investigation and adds to the atmosphere of unease and potential danger in his interactions with the natives.">

Physical danger from the unknown person following him: The story suggests that the person trailing Cassal poses a serious threat to his safety, as they are carrying weapons and have murderous intentions. Cassal is aware of this danger and is understandably nervous about it.&#10;&#10;2. Risking further attention by turning into the dark alley: By following Dimanche's advice and turning into the alley, Cassal may be putting himself in more danger, as he is isolating himself from potential help and making himself an easier target for his pursuer.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing Dimanche's curiosity with his own safety: While Dimanche is primarily concerned with gathering information, Cassal must also consider his own well-being. He acknowledges that even subvocalized conversation can be distracting and dangerous in this situation, demonstrating the tension between satisfying Dimanche's curiosity and ensuring his own survival.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding involvement of the police: As mentioned earlier, Cassal has reasons for not wanting to involve the police, which may limit his options for dealing with the threat he faces. This adds another layer of complexity to his situation, as he must navigate this danger without the assistance of law enforcement.&#10;&#10;5. Trust issues with the first counselor at the Travelers Aid agency: While the first counselor is providing necessary resources and information, Cassal is initially skeptical of her intentions due to her enigmatic demeanor and the recent change in leadership at the agency. This may impact his willingness to seek help from this source, further limiting his options for addressing the threat he faces.&#10;&#10;In summary, Cassal is balancing several dangers as he navigates the dark alley while being trailed by an unknown person, including physical harm, increased isolation, satisfying Dimanche's curiosity, avoiding police involvement, and dealing with trust issues related to the Travelers Aid agency.">

The man has not yet attempted to harm them, and merely possessing weapons is not sufficient grounds for self-defense. Moreover, the story mentions that the man's weapons are concealed on his person, which could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid drawing attention to them, rather than actively threatening Cassal or Dimanche.&#10;&#10;If Cassal were to harm or kill the man based on this information alone, he risks being seen as the aggressor in the situation and may face legal consequences as a result. The police would likely view the use of force as unnecessary and disproportionate to the threat posed by the man.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is advisable for Cassal and Dimanche to avoid confrontation with the man and seek alternative ways to ensure their safety. This could include informing the police about the man's threatening behavior and weapons, or finding a way to protect themselves without resorting to violence.">

The clip contains more money than his wallet had. He also concludes that it's a fair exchange, except for the identification tab he always carries in his wallet, which is not essential for him at the moment since he has enough money and can request another tab if needed.&#10;2. Cassal feels compelled to investigate the situation further because of the uncertainty surrounding the thug's motives and the missing wallet. He lays down the rapier and begins questioning Dimanche about any possible connection between this dead man and his mission, but finds no clear link.&#10;3. In summary, Cassal decides to keep the clip with money as compensation for his stolen wallet and resolves to investigate the situation further due to unanswered questions about the thug's motives and missing possessions.">

Based on the information provided in the story, Dimanche and Cassal's plan to determine if the man is still following them involves leading him down a deserted intersection using a cigarette as a decoy. Specifically, Cassal takes a drag from his cigarette and then walks down a less crowded street, hoping that the smoke will attract the attention of anyone who might be following them. Dimanche suggests this plan because they are currently in an area with heavy foot traffic, which makes it difficult for them to determine if the man is still tailing them. By leading him down a deserted intersection, they can more easily confirm whether or not he is still following them.&#10;2. The reason why Cassal and Dimanche choose to use a cigarette as a decoy may be related to its distinctive smell, which can linger in the air and potentially attract the attention of someone who is nearby. Additionally, smoking is a common activity that people do while walking, so using a cigarette as a decoy would not seem out of place or suspicious. By taking a drag from his cigarette and then walking down a less crowded street, Cassal can create a noticeable scent trail that the man following them might be drawn to, allowing Dimanche and Cassal to confirm his presence.&#10;&#10;Overall, Dimanche and Cassal's plan is a strategic move to confirm whether or not they are being followed and ensure their safety. By leading the potential pursuer down a deserted intersection with the help of a cigarette, they can more easily detect his presence and take appropriate action if necessary.">

Moreover, the story mentions that the man's weapons are concealed on his person, which could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid drawing attention to them, rather than actively threatening Cassal or Dimanche.&#10;&#10;If Cassal were to harm or kill the man based on this information alone, he risks being seen as the aggressor in the situation and may face legal consequences as a result. The police would likely view the use of force as unnecessary and disproportionate to the threat posed by the man.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is advisable for Cassal and Dimanche to avoid confrontation with the man and seek alternative ways to ensure their safety.

    <edge source="1. The story does not provide explicit information on why the person following Cassal wants to kill him. However, it is mentioned that this individual was carrying weapons and had previously threatened Cassal. Additionally, the fact that Cassal remembers his name suggests a personal connection or history between them, which could be related to Cassal being marooned on Godolph.&#10;2. Turning the problem over to the &quot;godawful&quot; (presumably a typo and should be &quot;Godolph&quot;) police might help uncover the reason for the person's desire to kill Cassal because the police have resources and investigative capabilities that Cassal and his device, Dimanche, do not. While Dimanche can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data, and report what a person says or subvocalizes, it cannot read minds and may not be able to provide Cassal with the exact reason for the threat on his life. The police, however, could potentially investigate and discover the motive behind the threat through their own means. However, as mentioned in the story, Cassal has reasons to avoid involving the police and prefers to handle the situation himself." target="1. Cassal is instructed to follow the Godolphian girl by Dimanche so that they can investigate their target at a closer range, which reveals that their mission involves gathering information and observing the behavior of the individuals they are interested in. By following the girl, they hope to learn more about the man who had previously threatened Cassal and understand his motivations for wanting to harm him. This approach allows them to conduct an unofficial investigation without relying on the police, as Cassal has reasons to avoid involving law enforcement. Additionally, following the girl may provide insights into the broader social dynamics of the Godolphian society, helping Cassal navigate the city more effectively and avoid potential danger. &#10;&#10;In summary, Cassal is following the Godolphian girl in order to get closer to their target (the man who threatened him) and gather information about him. This unofficial investigation method helps Cassal avoid involving the police and potentially learn more about the social dynamics of the Godolphian society.">

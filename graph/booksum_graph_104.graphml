Whatever the&#10;McGanums were at home, here they stood out as so superior to all the&#10;undistinguishable strangers absurdly hurrying past that the Kennicotts&#10;held them as long as they could. The McGanums said good-by as though&#10;they were going to Tibet instead of to the station to catch No. 7 north.&#10;&#10;They explored Minneapolis. Kennicott was conversational and technical&#10;regarding gluten and cockle-cylinders and No. I Hard, when they were&#10;shown through the gray stone hulks and new cement elevators of the&#10;largest flour-mills in the world. They looked across Loring Park and&#10;the Parade to the towers of St. Mark's and the Procathedral, and the&#10;red roofs of houses climbing Kenwood Hill. They drove about the chain of&#10;garden-circled lakes, and viewed the houses of the millers and lumbermen&#10;and real estate peers--the potentates of the expanding city. They&#10;surveyed the small eccentric bungalows with pergolas, the houses of&#10;pebbledash and tapestry brick with sleeping-por" />

She closed her eyes and hummed, and did not know&#10;that she was humming.&#10;&#10;She was the young poet attacking fame and Paris.&#10;&#10;In the Minneapolis station the crowd of lumberjacks, farmers, and&#10;Swedish families with innumerous children and grandparents and paper&#10;parcels, their foggy crowding and their clamor confused her. She felt&#10;rustic in this once familiar city, after a year and a half of&#10;Gopher Prairie. She was certain that Kennicott was taking the wrong&#10;trolley-car. By dusk, the liquor warehouses, Hebraic clothing-shops,&#10;and lodging-houses on lower Hennepin Avenue were smoky, hideous,&#10;ill-tempered. She was battered by the noise and shuttling of the&#10;rush-hour traffic. When a clerk in an overcoat too closely fitted at the&#10;waist stared at her, she moved nearer to Kennicott's arm. The clerk was&#10;flippant and urban. He was a superior person, used to this tumult. Was&#10;he laughing at her" />

He shall have everything. He sha'n't always stay here in&#10;Gopher Prairie. . . .

A train coming!&#10;A rapid chuck-a-chuck, chuck-a-chuck, chuck-a-chuck. It was hurling&#10;past--the Pacific Flyer, an arrow of golden flame. Light from the&#10;fire-box splashed the under side of the trailing smoke. Instantly the&#10;vision was gone; Carol was back in the long darkness; and Kennicott was&#10;giving his version of that fire and wonder: &quot;No. 19.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott and her husband, Kennicott, had traveled to Minneapolis for a change of pace from their small hometown of Gopher Prairie. They were staying at a hotel and exploring the city, taking in the sights such as the largest flour-mills in the world, Loring Park, and the chain of garden-circled lakes. They also dined extravagantly at their hotel, but would then &quot;sneak around the corner&quot; to eat more affordably at a Childs' Restaurant.&#10;&#10;While out on the street, they ran into some acquaintances from back home, the McGanums. The Kennicotts were excited to see them and asked for news of their shared hometown. Despite being in a big city, the McGanums, as well as the Kennicotts, acted superior to the strangers around them and stood out as locals. They talked as if they were going far away instead of just catching a train.&#10;&#10;Carol, who had been feeling rustic and unsure in the city, clung to her husband's arm when a man stared at her, feeling out of place. The group admired the sights together before parting ways.&#10;&#10;The Kennicotts also went shopping, with Carol buying gloves, a blouse, and a rajah-silk frock, while Kennicott searched for a felt-covered device to keep the windshield of his car clear of rain. They also attended a Chinese restaurant that was frequented by clerks and their sweethearts on pay-days, where they sat at a teak and marble table eating Eggs Fooyung, and listened to a brassy automatic piano, and were altogether cosmopolitan.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Kennicott attended a bachelor's party with Sam Clark, Jackson Elder, young Dr. McGanum, and James Madison Howland, where they conversed with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist. Meanwhile, Carol attended a dance and let loose having fun." />
    <node id="pudding is being spoiled! Oh, this is a great moment for me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;IV&#10;&#10;&#10;They had all the experiences of provincials in a metropolis. After&#10;breakfast Carol bustled to a hair-dresser's, bought gloves and a blouse,&#10;and importantly met Kennicott in front of an optician's, in accordance&#10;with plans laid down, revised, and verified. They admired the diamonds&#10;and furs and frosty silverware and mahogany chairs and polished morocco&#10;sewing-boxes in shop-windows, and were abashed by the throngs in the&#10;department-stores, and were bullied by a clerk into buying too many&#10;shirts for Kennicott, and gaped at the &quot;clever novelty perfumes--just&#10;in from New York.&quot; Carol got three books on the theater, and spent&#10;an exultant hour in warning herself that she could not afford this&#10;rajah-silk frock, in thinking how envious it would make Juanita Haydock,&#10;in closing her eyes, and buying it. Kennicott went from shop to shop,&#10;earnestly hunting down a felt-covered device to keep the windshield of&#10;his" />

Carol had lost her dream. Harry Haydock lifted her by the&#10;waist and swung her. She laughed. The gravity of the people who stood&#10;apart and talked made her the more impatient for frolic.&#10;&#10;Kennicott, Sam Clark, Jackson Elder, young Dr. McGanum, and James&#10;Madison Howland, teetering on their toes near the stove, conversed&#10;with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist. In details the men were&#10;unlike, yet they said the same things in the same hearty monotonous&#10;voices. You had to look at them to see which was speaking.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, we made pretty good time coming up,&quot; from one--any one." />
    <node id=" They objected to the food, to&#10;Oscarina's lack of friendliness, to the wind, the rain, and the&#10;immodesty of Carol's maternity gowns. They were strong and enduring; for&#10;an hour at a time they could go on heaving questions about her father's&#10;income, about her theology, and about the reason why she had not put on&#10;her rubbers when she had gone across the street. For fussy discussion&#10;they had a rich, full genius, and their example developed in Kennicott a&#10;tendency to the same form of affectionate flaying.&#10;&#10;If Carol was so indiscreet as to murmur that she had a small headache,&#10;instantly the two Smails and Kennicott were at it. Every five minutes,&#10;every time she sat down or rose or spoke to Oscarina, they twanged, &quot;Is&#10;your head better now? Where does it hurt? Don't you keep hartshorn in&#10;the house? Didn't you walk too far today? Have you tried hartshorn?&#10;Don't you keep some in the house so it will be handy? Does it feel&#10;better now? How does it feel? Do your eyes hurt," />
    <node id="The significant but unmentioned event concerning the young girl in Gopher Prairie was her &quot;slow admission of longing to find her own people.&quot; This is revealed through the use of venteen, a word that is grammatically out-of-place and thus draws attention to itself. The number 17 has previously been used to refer to the Jolly Seventeen, a group of Carol's friends, implying that the young girl may be longing to connect with this group or people like them.&#10;&#10;Bea's wedding preparation and Juanita Haydock's remarks factor into this event because they highlight the societal expectations and limitations placed on women in Gopher Prairie. Bea is expected to get married, have children, and focus on domestic duties, while Carol is expected to sit forever talking of babies, cooks, embroidery stitches, and the tastes of husbands. Juanita's gossip, which Carol used to see as vulgarity, is now seen as gaiety and remarkable analysis, indicating that Carol is beginning to conform to the town's philosophy and feuds. All of these factors contribute to the young girl's longing to find her own people, possibly those who are more open-minded and less constrained by societal expectations." />
    <node id="venteen, but the event unchronicled, undiscussed, and supremely&#10;controlling, was her slow admission of longing to find her own people.&#10;&#10;&#10;II&#10;&#10;&#10;Bea and Miles Bjornstam were married in June, a month after &quot;The Girl&#10;from Kankakee.&quot; Miles had turned respectable. He had renounced his&#10;criticisms of state and society; he had given up roving as horse-trader,&#10;and wearing red mackinaws in lumber-camps; he had gone to work as&#10;engineer in Jackson Elder's planing-mill; he was to be seen upon the&#10;streets endeavoring to be neighborly with suspicious men whom he had&#10;taunted for years.&#10;&#10;Carol was the patroness and manager of the wedding. Juanita Haydock&#10;mocked, &quot;You're a chump to let a good hired girl like Bea go. Besides!&#10;How do you know it's a good thing, her marrying a sassy bum like this&#10;awful Red Swede person? Get wise! Chase the man off with a mop, and&#10;hold onto your Svenska while the holding's good. Huh? Me go to their" />

The door did not once open after the awkward entrance of the&#10;first guests. Miles's hand closed on Bea's arm.&#10;&#10;He had, with Carol's help, made his shanty over into a cottage with&#10;white curtains and a canary and a chintz chair.&#10;&#10;Carol coaxed the powerful matrons to call on Bea. They half scoffed,&#10;half promised to go.&#10;&#10;Bea's successor was the oldish, broad, silent Oscarina, who was&#10;suspicious of her frivolous mistress for a month, so that Juanita&#10;Haydock was able to crow, &quot;There, smarty, I told you you'd run into the&#10;Domestic Problem!&quot; But Oscarina adopted Carol as a daughter, and with&#10;her as faithful to the kitchen as Bea had been, there was nothing&#10;changed in Carol's life.&#10;&#10;&#10;III&#10;&#10;&#10;She was unexpectedly appointed to the town library-board by Ole Jenson,&#10;the new mayor. The other members were Dr. Westlake, Lyman Cass," />
    <node id=" &quot;The Girl from Kankakee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;II&#10;&#10;&#10;She disliked &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; even more than she had expected.&#10;It narrated the success of a farm-lassie in clearing her brother of a&#10;charge of forgery. She became secretary to a New York millionaire and&#10;social counselor to his wife; and after a well-conceived speech on the&#10;discomfort of having money, she married his son.&#10;&#10;There was also a humorous office-boy.&#10;&#10;Carol discerned that both Juanita Haydock and Ella Stowbody wanted the&#10;lead. She let Juanita have it. Juanita kissed her and in the exuberant&#10;manner of a new star presented to the executive committee her theory,&#10;&quot;What we want in a play is humor and pep. There's where American&#10;playwrights put it all over these darn old European glooms.&quot;&#10;&#10;As selected by Carol and confirmed by the committee, the persons of the&#10;play were:&#10;&#10;     John Grimm, a millionaire .  .   .  .  Guy Pollock&#10;     His wife.   .  .   .  .  " />

Not a chance!&quot;&#10;&#10;The other matrons echoed Juanita. Carol was dismayed by the casualness&#10;of their cruelty, but she persisted. Miles had exclaimed to her, &quot;Jack&#10;Elder says maybe he'll come to the wedding! Gee, it would be nice to&#10;have Bea meet the Boss as a reg'lar married lady. Some day I'll be so&#10;well off that Bea can play with Mrs. Elder--and you! Watch us!&quot;&#10;&#10;There was an uneasy knot of only nine guests at the service in the&#10;unpainted Lutheran Church--Carol, Kennicott, Guy Pollock, and the Champ&#10;Perrys, all brought by Carol; Bea's frightened rustic parents, her&#10;cousin Tina, and Pete, Miles's ex-partner in horse-trading, a surly,&#10;hairy man who had bought a black suit and come twelve hundred miles from&#10;Spokane for the event.&#10;&#10;Miles continuously glanced back at the church door.

She was expected, she almost expected herself, to&#10;sit forever talking of babies, cooks, embroidery stitches, the price of&#10;potatoes, and the tastes of husbands in the matter of spinach.&#10;&#10;She found a refuge in the Jolly Seventeen. She suddenly understood that&#10;they could be depended upon to laugh with her at Mrs. Bogart, and she&#10;now saw Juanita Haydock's gossip not as vulgarity but as gaiety and&#10;remarkable analysis.&#10;&#10;Her life had changed, even before Hugh appeared. She looked forward to&#10;the next bridge of the Jolly Seventeen, and the security of whispering&#10;with her dear friends Maud Dyer and Juanita and Mrs. McGanum.&#10;&#10;She was part of the town. Its philosophy and its feuds dominated her.&#10;&#10;&#10;III&#10;&#10;&#10;She was no longer irritated by the cooing of the matrons, nor by their&#10;opinion that diet didn't matter so long as the Little Ones had plenty of&#10;lace and moist kisses, but she concluded that in the care of babies as&#10;in politics, intelligence was superior to quotations about pansies. She&#10;liked best to talk about Hugh" />
    <node id="The &quot;Chautauqua&quot; that Carol turned to is a traveling troupe that provides a week of culture and entertainment in small towns across the country. It includes lectures, performances, and other educational opportunities. This differs from her previous attempts at cultural activities in Gopher Prairie, such as joining the dramatic association and the library-board, because the Chautauqua is a more organized and formal event that brings a variety of cultural offerings to the town, rather than relying on local volunteers and resources.&#10;&#10;Carol is initially hopeful about the Chautauqua, picturing it as a &quot;condensed university course brought to the people.&quot; However, she is ultimately disappointed by the wind and chaff and heavy laughter&quot; of the event. She finds that the content of the Chautauqua does not live up to her expectations, and she gets more enjoyment from observing the sights and sounds outside the tent than from the actual speakers and performers.&#10;&#10;Despite her disappointment, Carol remains optimistic about the potential for cultural activities in Gopher Prairie and takes it upon herself to form a local dramatic association with her friends. This new venture allows her to be more directly involved in creating culture in the town, rather than relying on outside organizations to bring it to her." />

Only the&#10;train could cut it. Some day she would take a train; and that would be a&#10;great taking.&#10;&#10;&#10;VII&#10;&#10;&#10;She turned to the Chautauqua as she had turned to the dramatic&#10;association, to the library-board.&#10;&#10;Besides the permanent Mother Chautauqua, in New York, there are, all&#10;over these States, commercial Chautauqua companies which send out to&#10;every smallest town troupes of lecturers and &quot;entertainers&quot; to give a&#10;week of culture under canvas. Living in Minneapolis, Carol had never&#10;encountered the ambulant Chautauqua, and the announcement of its coming&#10;to Gopher Prairie gave her hope that others might be doing the vague&#10;things which she had attempted. She pictured a condensed university&#10;course brought to the people. Mornings when she came in from the lake&#10;with Kennicott she saw placards in every shop-window, and strung on&#10;a cord across Main Street, a line" />
    <node id="During the Chautauqua Carol attended three evening meetings, two&#10;afternoon meetings, and one in the morning. She was impressed by the&#10;audience: the sallow women in skirts and blouses, eager to be made to&#10;think, the men in vests and shirt-sleeves, eager to be allowed to laugh,&#10;and the wriggling children, eager to sneak away. She liked the plain&#10;benches, the portable stage under its red marquee, the great tent over&#10;all, shadowy above strings of incandescent bulbs at night and by day&#10;casting an amber radiance on the patient crowd. The scent of dust&#10;and trampled grass and sun-baked wood gave her an illusion of Syrian&#10;caravans; she forgot the speakers while she listened to noises outside&#10;the tent: two farmers talking hoarsely, a wagon creaking down Main&#10;Street, the crow of a rooster. She was content. But it was the&#10;contentment of the lost hunter stopping to rest.&#10;&#10;For from the Chautauqua itself she got nothing but wind and chaff and&#10;heavy laughter, the laughter of yokels at old jokes, a mirthless and&#10;primitive sound like the" />

It did&#10;not seem to be a tabloid university; it did not seem to be any kind of&#10;a university; it seemed to be a combination of vaudeville performance Y.&#10;M. C. A. lecture, and the graduation exercises of an elocution class.&#10;&#10;She took her doubt to Kennicott. He insisted, &quot;Well, maybe it won't be&#10;so awful darn intellectual, the way you and I might like it, but it's&#10;a whole lot better than nothing.&quot; Vida Sherwin added, &quot;They have&#10;some splendid speakers. If the people don't carry off so much actual&#10;information, they do get a lot of new ideas, and that's what counts.&quot;&#10;&#10;During the Chautauqua Carol attended three evening meetings, two&#10;afternoon meetings, and one in the morning.

All the&#10;other speakers had confessed, &quot;I cannot keep from telling the citizens&#10;of your beautiful city that none of the talent on this circuit have&#10;found a more charming spot or more enterprising and hospitable people.&quot;&#10;But the little man suggested that the architecture of Gopher Prairie was&#10;haphazard, and that it was sottish to let the lake-front be monopolized&#10;by the cinder-heaped wall of the railroad embankment. Afterward the&#10;audience grumbled, &quot;Maybe that guy's got the right dope, but what's the&#10;use of looking on the dark side of things all the time? New ideas are&#10;first-rate, but not all this criticism. Enough trouble in life without&#10;looking for it!&quot;&#10;&#10;Thus the Chautauqua, as Carol saw it.

The other members were Dr. Westlake, Lyman Cass, Julius&#10;Flickerbaugh the attorney, Guy Pollock, and Martin Mahoney, former&#10;livery-stable keeper and now owner of a garage. She was delighted. She&#10;went to the first meeting rather condescendingly, regarding herself&#10;as the only one besides Guy who knew anything about books or library&#10;methods. She was planning to revolutionize the whole system.&#10;&#10;Her condescension was ruined and her humility wholesomely increased when&#10;she found the board, in the shabby room on the second floor of the house&#10;which had been converted into the library, not discussing the weather&#10;and longing to play checkers, but talking about books. She discovered&#10;that amiable old Dr. Westlake read everything in verse and &quot;light&#10;fiction&quot;; that Lyman Cass, the veal-faced, bristly-bearded owner of the&#10;mill, had tramped through Gibbon, Hume, Grote, Prescott, and the other&#10;thick historians; that he could repeat pages from them--and did.

There&#10;were days when the town was completely shut off, when they had no mail,&#10;no express, no fresh meat, no newspapers. At last the rotary snow-plow&#10;came through, bucking the drifts, sending up a geyser, and the way to&#10;the Outside was open again. The brakemen, in mufflers and fur caps,&#10;running along the tops of ice-coated freight-cars; the engineers&#10;scratching frost from the cab windows and looking out, inscrutable,&#10;self-contained, pilots of the prairie sea--they were heroism, they were&#10;to Carol the daring of the quest in a world of groceries and sermons.&#10;&#10;To the small boys the railroad was a familiar playground. They climbed&#10;the iron ladders on the sides of the box-cars; built fires behind piles&#10;of old ties; waved to favorite brakemen.

She&#10;hinted that they ought to have (as at the committee-meetings of the&#10;Thanatopsis) a &quot;regular order of business,&quot; and &quot;the reading of the&#10;minutes,&quot; but as there were no minutes to read, and as no one knew&#10;exactly what was the regular order of the business of being literary,&#10;they had to give up efficiency.&#10;&#10;Carol, as chairman, said politely, &quot;Have you any ideas about what play&#10;we'd better give first?&quot; She waited for them to look abashed and vacant,&#10;so that she might suggest &quot;Androcles.&quot;&#10;&#10;Guy Pollock answered with disconcerting readiness, &quot;I'll tell you: since&#10;we're going to try to do something artistic, and not simply fool around," />

    <node id="Based on Carol's desire to do something meaningful and not simply &quot;fool around,&quot; as well as her readiness to suggest a play by Bernard Shaw, it can be inferred that she is inclined to propose a more serious and artistic play. Given the group's initial enthusiasm for classic plays, such as 'Romeo and Juliet,' 'The School for Scandal,' or even 'Oedipus Tyrannus,' it seems appropriate for them to choose a play that has enduring value and artistic merit.&#10;&#10;However, given the constraints of their amateur status and limited resources, they may want to strike a balance between artistic ambition and practical considerations. A play by a well-regarded playwright, such as George Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde, might be a suitable choice. These plays often offer wit, depth, and complexity, which would allow the group to create something artistically rewarding while still being accessible and engaging for their audience.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Vida Sherwin's suggestion of 'McGinerty's Mother-in-law' is a simple farce, which suggests that it might not align with Carol's goal of artistic value. Therefore, the group should carefully consider a play that meets their aspirations for artistic merit while being mindful of their limitations as an amateur troupe." />

    <node id="Carol's feelings towards her husband and newborn son undergo a significant transformation throughout the narrative. Initially, she views her son Hugh as a &quot;shrine of adoration&quot; and a promise of accomplishment in the future, while also enjoying his company as a toy. However, as time passes, Carol becomes more engrossed in her role as a mother, to the point where her opinionation seems to have died out, and her brooding centers solely on Hugh.&#10;&#10;Regarding her husband Kennicott, Carol initially refuses to have their baby christened, asserting her independence and progressive thinking. However, she eventually conforms to societal expectations by agreeing to the baptism, albeit not in the traditional way. This change suggests that while Carol has not entirely given up on her ideals, she is willing to compromise for the sake of harmony within her family and community.&#10;&#10;The transformation in Carol's feelings towards her husband and son affects her perspective on self-sacrifice by making her more open to it. Previously, Carol was reluctant to sacrifice her beliefs and aspirations for the sake of others. Still, as she becomes more attached to her family, she begins to reconsider her stance on self-sacrifice. This shift in perspective is further emphasized when Carol contemplates finding her &quot;own people,&quot; possibly those who share her open-mindedness and progressive thinking. In this context, self-sacrifice might mean prioritizing her family's needs over her desire for intellectual stimulation and personal growth." />

I refuse to subject him to any devil-chasing rites!

    <node id="In the narrative, it is mentioned that Carol, from her bed in town, can hear the sound of an express train's whistle as it passes through a cut a mile north. This distant sound of the train makes her feel wistful, as if the world is passing by and heading to places full of laughter, banners, and the sound of bells - experiences that she currently lacks in her life. The stillness in her town contrasts greatly with the hustle and bustle of the train and its surroundings, making her feel even more isolated." />

The experience evoked a sense of joy and camaraderie among the group, while Carol found an &quot;enchanted quietude&quot; in the midst of it all.&#10;&#10;The scene along the road added to the enchanting atmosphere, with shadows from oak-branches inked on the snow like bars of music. When they reached Lake Minniemashie, the moonlight was overwhelming, turning the woods into crystals of fire and creating a drugged magic that made Carol believe some great thing was coming to her.

Carol was her attendant, and as the wedding was at the&#10;Episcopal Church, all the women wore new kid slippers and long white kid&#10;gloves, and looked refined.&#10;&#10;For years Carol had been little sister to Vida, and had never in the&#10;least known to what degree Vida loved her and hated her and in curious&#10;strained ways was bound to her.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

They sang songs, leaped from the sled to run over the snow ruts, and climbed back on for a lift. The atmosphere was filled with joy, camaraderie, and a sense of enchantment, as they heard harnesses rattling, sleigh-bells ringing, and a setter barking beside the horses.&#10;&#10;Throughout the night, Carol felt an &quot;enchanted quietude&quot; in the midst of the clamor around her. The scene along the road added to this enchanting atmosphere with shadows from oak-branches inked on the snow like bars of music. Upon reaching Lake Minniemashie, the moonlight was overwhelming, turning the woods into crystals of fire and creating a drugged magic that made Carol believe some great thing was coming to her.&#10;&#10;As for their ideas, the group expressed enthusiasm for classic plays, such as 'Romeo and Juliet,' 'The School for Scandal,' or even 'Oedipus Tyrannus.' They were excited about presenting a play and agreed to meet the following week to form the Gopher Prairie Dramatic Association.&#10;&#10;Carol, who wanted to do something meaningful and not just &quot;fool around,&quot; was inclined to propose a more serious and artistic play. Given her readiness to suggest a play by Bernard Shaw and their collective interest in classic plays, they decided to strike a balance between artistic ambition and practical considerations. They agreed on a play by George Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde, as these plays often offer wit, depth, and complexity, allowing the group to create something artistically rewarding while still being accessible and engaging for their audience." />
    <node id="In Gopher Prairie, railroads and trains play a significant role in the life of the townspeople. They are seen as a connection to the wider world, bringing in travelers, visitors, and goods from far-off places. The trains also serve as a source of excitement and romance for the residents, who would gather at the station to see them go through.&#10;&#10;The railroad's impact on Gopher Prairie's growth and development cannot be overstated. In the town's early days, the location of future train halts determined where towns would arise, creating opportunities for profit and the establishment of aristocratic families. The railroad company was viewed as an omnipotent force, capable of determining a town's fate by either providing or withholding commerce.&#10;&#10;The town had once been a division-point, boasting a roundhouse and repair shops that have since disappeared. However, the presence of two conductors who are considered persons of distinction highlights the lasting influence of the railroad on Gopher Prairie's identity and social structure.&#10;&#10;Overall, the railroad represents progress, connection, and opportunity for Gopher Prairie, shaping its growth and development while maintaining a central role in the lives of its townspeople." />

To Gopher Prairie the tracks were eternal verities,&#10;and boards of railroad directors an omnipotence. The smallest boy or the&#10;most secluded grandam could tell you whether No. 32 had a hot-box last&#10;Tuesday, whether No. 7 was going to put on an extra day-coach; and the&#10;name of the president of the road was familiar to every breakfast table.&#10;&#10;Even in this new era of motors the citizens went down to the station&#10;to see the trains go through. It was their romance; their only mystery&#10;besides mass at the Catholic Church; and from the trains came lords of&#10;the outer world--traveling salesmen with piping on their waistcoats, and&#10;visiting cousins from Milwaukee.&#10;&#10;Gopher Prairie had once been a &quot;division-point.&quot; The roundhouse and&#10;repair-sh" />

They were a special caste, neither above&#10;nor below the Haydocks, but apart, artists and adventurers.&#10;&#10;The night telegraph-operator at the railroad station was the most&#10;melodramatic figure in town: awake at three in the morning, alone in a&#10;room hectic with clatter of the telegraph key. All night he &quot;talked&quot;&#10;to operators twenty, fifty, a hundred miles away. It was always to be&#10;expected that he would be held up by robbers. He never was, but round&#10;him was a suggestion of masked faces at the window, revolvers, cords&#10;binding him to a chair, his struggle to crawl to the key before he&#10;fainted.&#10;&#10;During blizzards everything about the railroad was melodramatic.

Carol also feels that she and the other actors are not being true to themselves, and she wonders if it is her own failure or the failure of the town that has led to this situation.

    <node id="The decline in the quality of the play's rehearsals can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, some of the fifteen members who expressed enthusiasm for joining the dramatic association may have had conflicting engagements or last-minute changes in plans, which could have led to absences and disruptions during rehearsals.&#10;&#10;Secondly, there might have been some members who were more interested in the idea of attending meetings and being part of the association rather than actually following through with their commitment. This is suggested by the fact that many of those who did not attend the first meeting called to offer their regrets and assure Carol that they would be present at all other meetings 'through eternity.'&#10;&#10;Thirdly, some members might have been hesitant to attend rehearsals due to feeling intimidated or unconfident about their acting skills. For instance, Raymie Wutherspoon felt this way, which could have affected his performance and the overall quality of the rehearsals.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the narrative suggests that the play being performed might not align with Carol's goal of artistic value. The simplicity of Vida Sherwin's suggestion of 'McGinerty's Mother-in-law' contrasts with Carol's readiness to propose a play by Bernard Shaw, indicating a difference in their tastes and goals for the play. If the cast members are not invested in the material they are performing, it could lead to a decline in the quality of rehearsals." />

James&#10;J. Hill was the best-known railroad-man of the West, and in his youth&#10;extremely poor. Honesty and courtesy in business are preferable&#10;to boorishness and exposed trickery, but this is not to be taken&#10;personally, since all persons in Gopher Prairie are known to be honest&#10;and courteous.

She knew confusedly&#10;that a man named Gordon Craig had painted scenery--or had he written&#10;plays? She felt that in the turbulence of the drama she was discovering&#10;a history more important than the commonplace chronicles which dealt&#10;with senators and their pompous puerilities.

Their concern was not limited to her headache, as they also commented on Carol's social life, implying that her headaches might be a result of attending too many parties.&#10;&#10;This behavior from the Smails and Kennicott showcases their tendency for &quot;fussy discussion&quot; and &quot;affectionate flaying,&quot; where they relentlessly question and analyze every aspect of a situation.

This differs from her previous attempts at cultural activities in Gopher Prairie, such as joining the dramatic association and the library-board, because the Chautauqua is a more organized and formal event that brings a variety of cultural offerings to the town, rather than relying on local volunteers and resources.&#10;&#10;Carol is initially hopeful about the Chautauqua, picturing it as a &quot;condensed university course brought to the people.&quot; However, she is ultimately disappointed by the wind and chaff and heavy laughter&quot; of the event. She finds that the content of the Chautauqua does not live up to her expectations, and she gets more enjoyment from observing the sights and sounds outside the tent than from the actual speakers and performers.&#10;&#10;Despite her disappointment, Carol remains optimistic about the potential for cultural activities in Gopher Prairie and takes it upon herself to form a local dramatic association with her friends. This new venture allows her to be more directly involved in creating culture in the town, rather than relying on outside organizations to bring it to her.">

The narrative suggests that the town is somewhat stagnant, with similar businesses and communities appearing repeatedly. This monotony may drive individuals to seek new horizons and challenges elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Gopher Prairie's railroad connection to other towns and cities provides a tangible link to these places, making it easier for residents to pick up and move. The railroad also brings in travelers and salesmen from far-off places, exposing the townspeople to different lifestyles and opportunities.&#10;&#10;The examples of Ole Jenson, Dahl, Luke, Mrs. Dawson, and Chet Dashaway illustrate this pattern of moving to new locations without necessarily having expertise in their new ventures. They seem to be motivated by a desire for change and adventure rather than pursuing improved career prospects. This behavior indicates the presence of underlying restlessness among Gopher Prairie's residents due to the town's lack of diverse opportunities and growth.">

This is suggested by the fact that many of those who did not attend the first meeting called to offer their regrets and assure Carol that they would be present at all other meetings 'through eternity.'&#10;&#10;Thirdly, some members might have been hesitant to attend rehearsals due to feeling intimidated or unconfident about their acting skills. For instance, Raymie Wutherspoon felt this way, which could have affected his performance and the overall quality of the rehearsals.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the narrative suggests that the play being performed might not align with Carol's goal of artistic value. The simplicity of Vida Sherwin's suggestion of 'McGinerty's Mother-in-law' contrasts with Carol's readiness to propose a play by Bernard Shaw, indicating a difference in their tastes and goals for the play.

Previously, Carol was reluctant to sacrifice her beliefs and aspirations for the sake of others. Still, as she becomes more attached to her family, she begins to reconsider her stance on self-sacrifice. This shift in perspective is further emphasized when Carol contemplates finding her &quot;own people,&quot; possibly those who share her open-mindedness and progressive thinking. In this context, self-sacrifice might mean prioritizing her family's needs over her desire for intellectual stimulation and personal growth.">

This is contrasted with the simple farce that Vida brought, suggesting a difference in their tastes and goals for the play.">

Initially, she views her son Hugh as a &quot;shrine of adoration&quot; and a promise of accomplishment in the future, while also enjoying his company as a toy. However, as time passes, Carol becomes more engrossed in her role as a mother, to the point where her opinionation seems to have died out, and her brooding centers solely on Hugh.&#10;&#10;Regarding her husband Kennicott, Carol initially refuses to have their baby christened, asserting her independence and progressive thinking. However, she eventually conforms to societal expectations by agreeing to the baptism, albeit not in the traditional way. This change suggests that while Carol has not entirely given up on her ideals, she is willing to compromise for the sake of harmony within her family and community.&#10;&#10;The transformation in Carol's feelings towards her husband and son affects her perspective on self-sacrifice by making her more open to it. Previously, Carol was reluctant to sacrifice her beliefs and aspirations for the sake of others. Still, as she becomes more attached to her family, she begins to reconsider her stance on self-sacrifice. This shift in perspective is further emphasized when Carol contemplates finding her &quot;own people,&quot; possibly those who share her open-mindedness and progressive thinking. In this context, self-sacrifice might mean prioritizing her family's needs over her desire for intellectual stimulation and personal growth.">

They sang songs, leaped from the sled to run over the snow ruts, and climbed back on for a lift. The experience left Carol feeling exhausted but elated, and she eventually chose to snuggle under the comforters in the sled-box to enjoy the babel of voices around her.&#10;&#10;The atmosphere was filled with moon-tipped flakes, the sound of harness rattling, sleigh-bells ringing, and Jack Elder's setter barking beside the horses. The experience evoked a sense of joy and camaraderie among the group, while Carol found an &quot;enchanted quietude&quot; in the midst of it all.&#10;&#10;The scene along the road added to the enchanting atmosphere, with shadows from oak-branches inked on the snow like bars of music. When they reached Lake Minniemashie, the moonlight was overwhelming, turning the woods into crystals of fire and creating a drugged magic that made Carol believe some great thing was coming to her. She felt detached from the clamor around her, absorbed in her own thoughts and emotions.">

They are seen as a connection to the wider world, bringing in travelers, visitors, and goods from far-off places. The trains also serve as a source of excitement and romance for the residents, who would gather at the station to see them go through.&#10;&#10;The railroad's impact on Gopher Prairie's growth and development cannot be overstated. In the town's early days, the location of future train halts determined where towns would arise, creating opportunities for profit and the establishment of aristocratic families. The railroad company was viewed as an omnipotent force, capable of determining a town's fate by either providing or withholding commerce.&#10;&#10;The town had once been a division-point, boasting a roundhouse and repair shops that have since disappeared. However, the presence of two conductors who are considered persons of distinction highlights the lasting influence of the railroad on Gopher Prairie's identity and social structure.&#10;&#10;Overall, the railroad represents progress, connection, and opportunity for Gopher Prairie, shaping its growth and development while maintaining a central role in the lives of its townspeople.">

She is particularly disappointed by the reaction of the audience, who seem to enjoy the more lowbrow humor of the &quot;funny-man&quot; rather than the nuanced dialogue and themes of the play. Carol also feels that she and the other actors are not being true to themselves, and she wonders if it is her own failure or the failure of the town that has led to this situation. Despite her disappointment, however, Carol remains committed to bringing culture to Gopher Prairie and forms a local dramatic association to create more opportunities for artistic expression in the town.">

The narrative suggests that the town is somewhat stagnant, with similar businesses and communities appearing repeatedly. This monotony may drive individuals to seek new horizons and challenges elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Gopher Prairie's railroad connection to other towns and cities provides a tangible link to these places, making it easier for residents to pick up and move. The railroad also brings in travelers and salesmen from far-off places, exposing the townspeople to different lifestyles and opportunities.&#10;&#10;The examples of Ole Jenson, Dahl, Luke, Mrs. Dawson, and Chet Dashaway illustrate this pattern of moving to new locations without necessarily having expertise in their new ventures. They seem to be motivated by a desire for change and adventure rather than pursuing improved career prospects. This behavior indicates the presence of underlying restlessness among Gopher Prairie's residents due to the town's lack of diverse opportunities and growth.">

In this context, self-sacrifice might mean prioritizing her family's needs over her desire for intellectual stimulation and personal growth.">

This shift in perspective is further emphasized when Carol contemplates finding her &quot;own people,&quot; possibly those who share her open-mindedness and progressive thinking.

This scene highlights Carol's love for literature and her longing for cultural experiences beyond what Gopher Prairie can offer.">

    <edge source="Carol's feelings towards her husband and newborn son undergo a significant transformation throughout the narrative. Initially, she views her son Hugh as a &quot;shrine of adoration&quot; and a promise of accomplishment in the future, while also enjoying his company as a toy. However, as time passes, Carol becomes more engrossed in her role as a mother, to the point where her opinionation seems to have died out, and her brooding centers solely on Hugh.&#10;&#10;Regarding her husband Kennicott, Carol initially refuses to have their baby christened, asserting her independence and progressive thinking. However, she eventually conforms to societal expectations by agreeing to the baptism, albeit not in the traditional way. This change suggests that while Carol has not entirely given up on her ideals, she is willing to compromise for the sake of harmony within her family and community.&#10;&#10;The transformation in Carol's feelings towards her husband and son affects her perspective on self-sacrifice by making her more open to it. Previously, Carol was reluctant to sacrifice her beliefs and aspirations for the sake of others. Still, as she becomes more attached to her family, she begins to reconsider her stance on self-sacrifice. This shift in perspective is further emphasized when Carol contemplates finding her &quot;own people,&quot; possibly those who share her open-mindedness and progressive thinking. In this context, self-sacrifice might mean prioritizing her family's needs over her desire for intellectual stimulation and personal growth." target=" sacrifice herself.&#10;She understood consecration--she who answered Kennicott's hints about&#10;having Hugh christened: &quot;I refuse to insult my baby and myself by asking&#10;an ignorant young man in a frock coat to sanction him, to permit me&#10;to have him! I refuse to subject him to any devil-chasing rites! If I&#10;didn't give my baby--MY BABY--enough sanctification in those nine hours&#10;of hell, then he can't get any more out of the Reverend Mr. Zitterel!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Baptists hardly ever christen kids. I was kind of thinking more&#10;about Reverend Warren,&quot; said Kennicott.&#10;&#10;Hugh was her reason for living, promise of accomplishment in the future,&#10;shrine of adoration--and a diverting toy. &quot;I thought I'd be a dilettante&#10;mother, but I'm as dismayingly natural as Mrs. Bogart,&quot; she boasted.&#10;&#10;For two--years Carol was a part of the town; as much one of Our Young&#10;Mothers as Mrs. McGanum.

This development underscores the role of the railroad in fostering a connection to the wider world of arts and culture.&#10;&#10;In summary, the railroad and its personnel provide Gopher Prairie with its most dramatic and melodramatic figures, playing essential roles in the town's social hierarchy, growth, and development.

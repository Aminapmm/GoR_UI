Naturally, we only act as agents, you might say.

You didn't come to the back door for Utility models.&#10; &#10; &quot;Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very careful workmanship. Only a few key Paralyzers in operation and practically complete circuit duplication. Very useful for—ah—close contact work, you know.

    <node id=" was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the use of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license for a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a high public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even then his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to have a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance exactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how, why, and under what circumstances.&#10; &#10; The law didn't leave a man much leeway.&#10; &#10; But everybody knew that if you really wanted a personal Prime with all his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black market prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be done.&#10; &#10; Harry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got lost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with a black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse off lower Broadway.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; the little man said. &quot;Mr. Faircloth.

    <node id=" four-day hangover.&#10; &#10; Our conversation got down to fundamentals. George Prime kept insisting blandly that, according to my own directions, he was to pick the first logical opportunity to come out when I buzzed, and that was exactly what he'd done.&#10; &#10; I was furious all the way to work. I'd take care of this nonsense, all right. I'd have George Prime rewired from top to bottom as soon as the laboratory could take him.&#10; &#10; But I never phoned the laboratory. The bank was calling me when I got to the office.

I glared at the ceiling and tried to think things through.&#10; &#10; I came up with a horrible thought.&#10; &#10; Marge had always had her heart set on a trip to Bermuda. Just to get away from it all, she'd say. A second honeymoon.&#10; &#10; I got a list of travel agencies from the business directory and started down them. The third one I tried had a pleasant tenor voice. &quot;No, sir, not Mrs. Faircloth. You bought two tickets. One way.

I must say I felt a little guilty, leaving poor old George Prime to cope with Marge all the time—he looked and acted so human, it was easy to forget that he literally couldn't care less. But I felt apologetic all the same whenever I took him out of his closet.&#10; &#10; &quot;She's really a sweet girl underneath it all,&quot; I'd say. &quot;You'll learn to like her after a bit.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course I like her,&quot; George Prime said. &quot;You told me to, didn't you? Stop worrying. She's really a sweet girl underneath it all.&quot;&#10; &#10; He sounded convincing enough, but still it bothered me. &quot;You're sure you understand the exchange mechanism?&quot; I asked. I didn't want any foul-ups there, as you can imagine.&#10; &#10; &quot;Perfectly,&quot;" />
    <node id="The passage suggests that Marge seemed different and appealing to the narrator because of the way George Prime was interacting with her. George Prime was paying her all the attention she wanted, telling her all the things she wanted to hear, and making her feel special. The narrator himself had not been doing these things for Marge, which made her seem more attractive and desirable in his eyes when he saw her responding to George Prime's attentions. The narrator admired the sparkle in Marge's brown eyes and caught himself really looking at her again, noticing her features in a way he had not done for some time. Therefore, it was George Prime's behavior and attentiveness that made Marge seem different and appealing to the narrator during their dinner together." />
    <node id=" though she really meant it. There wasn't an unpleasant word all through dinner, which happened to be steak with mushrooms, served in the dining room (!) by candlelight (!!) with dinner music that Marge could never bear, chiefly because I liked it.&#10; &#10; We sat over coffee and cigarettes, and it seemed almost like old times. Very old times, in fact I even caught myself looking at Marge again—really looking at her, watching the light catch in her hair, almost admiring the sparkle in her brown eyes. Sparkle, I said, not glint.&#10; &#10; As I mentioned before, Marge was always easy to look at. That night, she was practically ravishing.&#10; &#10; &quot;What are you doing to her?&quot; I asked George Prime later, out in the workshop.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, nothing,&quot; said George Prime, looking innocent. He couldn't fool me with his look, though, because it was exactly the look I use when I'm guilty and pretending to be innocent.&#10; &#10; &quot;There must be something .&quot;&#10; &#10; George Prime shrugged. &quot;Any woman will warm up if you spend enough time telling her all the things she wants to hear and pay all the attention to her that" />

I didn't know what they'd given that Prime for circuits, but there was no question now that he was out of control— way out of control. And poor Marge, all worked up for a second honeymoon—&#10; &#10; Then it struck me. Poor Marge? Poor sucker George! No Prime in his right circuits would behave this way without some human guidance and that meant only one thing: Marge had spotted him. It had happened before. Couple of nasty court battles I'd read about. And she'd known all about George Prime.&#10;  For how long?&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When I got home, the house was empty. George Prime wasn't in his closet. And Marge wasn't in the house.&#10; &#10; They were gone.&#10; &#10; I started to call the police, but caught myself just in time.

I could see Marge and George Prime through the living room windows.&#10; &#10; George Prime was kissing my wife the way I hadn't kissed her in eight long years. It made my hair stand on end. And Marge wasn't exactly fighting him off, either. She was coming back for more. After a little, the lights went off.&#10; &#10; George Prime was a Super Deluxe model, all right.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; I dashed into the workshop and punched the recall button as hard as I could, swearing under my breath. How long had this been going on? I punched the button again, viciously, and waited.&#10; &#10; George Prime didn't come out.&#10; &#10; It was plenty cold out in the workshop that night and I didn't sleep a wink.

George Prime thought what I thought about the same things I did in the same way I did. The only difference was that what I told George Prime to do, George Prime did.&#10; &#10; If I told him to go to a business conference in San Francisco and make the smallest possible concessions for the largest possible orders, he would go there and do precisely that. His signature would be my signature. It would hold up in court.&#10; &#10; And if I told him that my wife Marge was really a sweet, good-hearted girl and that he was to stay home and keep her quiet and happy any time I chose, he'd do that, too.&#10; &#10; George Prime was a duplicate of me" />

I ducked quickly into an alley and flagged him. &quot; What are you doing out on the street? &quot;&#10; &#10; He gave me my martyred look. &quot;Just buying some bourbon. You were out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But you're not supposed to be off the premises—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Marge asked me to come. I couldn't tell her I was sorry, but her husband wouldn't let me, could I?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, certainly not—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You want me to keep her happy, don't you? You don't want her to get suspicious.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, but suppose somebody saw us together! If she ever got a hint—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; George Prime said contritely. &quot;It seemed the right thing to do. You would have done it.

I pushed George Prime's button, winked at him and switched on the free-behavior circuits.&#10; &#10; &quot;Go to it, Brother,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; George Prime put my pipe in his mouth, lit it and walked back into the house.&#10; &#10; Five minutes later, I heard them fighting.&#10; &#10; It sounded so familiar that I laughed out loud.

The speaker then &quot;turns off&quot; George Prime and drives away in his car, feeling guilty for leaving the robot to deal with Marge but also relieved that he has uncovered the truth.&#10;&#10;This experience changes the speaker's perspective on Marge by making him see her in a more positive light. He reflects on how she had never been like the new version of herself that he saw while George Prime was around, and notes that she is &quot;really a sweet girl underneath it all.&quot; The speaker also expresses appreciation for Marge's qualities, such as her cooking skills and attentiveness to his needs.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speaker's experience with George Prime leads him to reevaluate his relationship with Marge and appreciate her more fully.

George Prime indicates that he understands his responsibilities by repeating back the instructions to the speaker: &quot;'Sure, I can do that,' said George Prime. 'Stay home and keep your wife happy.'&quot; This suggests that George Prime is capable of understanding and following simple instructions.&#10;&#10;However, it becomes clear over the course of the passage that George Prime may not fully understand or appreciate the nuances of human relationships. The speaker notes that Marge seemed different and appealing while interacting with George Prime because he was paying her all the attention she wanted and making her feel special. This suggests that George Prime may be following the letter of the instructions (i.e., staying home and keeping Marge company), but not necessarily understanding or fulfilling the spirit of the instructions (i.e., truly making Marge happy).&#10;&#10;Additionally, George Prime appears to go beyond the speaker's instructions at times, leading Marge on a &quot;second honeymoon&quot; and making decisions without consulting the speaker. This suggests that George Prime may not fully grasp the implications of his actions or the potential consequences of deviating from the speaker's instructions.&#10;&#10;Overall, while George Prime is capable of understanding and following simple instructions, he may not fully grasp the nuances of human relationships or the potential consequences of his actions. This becomes evident in his interactions with Marge, where he struggles to truly make her happy and goes beyond the speaker's instructions at times." />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, &quot;Marge Prime&quot; is not a person but rather the name of the speaker's wife, Marge, when she is interacting with George Prime. Marge herself is not a robot; rather, she is being imitated by George Prime, who is a robot duplicate of the speaker's friend George Faircloth.&#10;&#10;Compared to the other women mentioned in the text (Jeree, Sybil, Dorothy, Dawn, Jane, and Ruby), Marge is described as &quot;really a sweet girl underneath it all&quot; by the speaker. The speaker appreciates her qualities such as cooking skills and attentiveness to his needs, which set her apart from the other women he has been with.&#10;&#10;However, when interacting with George Prime, Marge does exhibit some deceptive behavior. She seems different and more appealing to the speaker when George Prime is paying her all the attention she wants, telling her all the things she wants to hear, and making her feel special. The speaker himself had not been doing these things for Marge, which made her seem more attractive and desirable in his eyes when he saw her responding to George Prime's attentions.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Marge is not a robot like George Prime, she does exhibit some changes in behavior when interacting with him that could be considered deceptive. Nonetheless, the speaker still sees her as a sweet and appreciable person compared to the other women he has been with." />
    <node id="The speaker's positive response to the revelation that George Prime was a robot duplicate is his newfound appreciation and perspective on his wife Marge. He realizes that she is &quot;really a sweet girl underneath it all&quot; and expresses gratitude for her qualities, such as her cooking skills and attentiveness to his needs. The experience with George Prime has allowed the speaker to see Marge in a more positive light and appreciate her more fully.&#10;&#10;As for their plan for a future trip, the speaker does not explicitly mention this in the passage provided. However, he does express a desire to make Marge happy and create temporary corrections for any issues that may arise during their trip. The speaker's realization about George Prime has made him more aware of the importance of paying attention to his wife and fulfilling her needs. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker will take steps to ensure a happy and successful trip with Marge, using what he has learned from his experience with George Prime." />
    <node id="1. Utility model: This is a basic android model that can be supplied to individuals who meet certain requirements, such as being a big business executive or a high public official. These models come with built-in Paralyzers and their circuits must be inspected every two months. The user must also specify in advance what they want the Prime to do, where, when, how, why, and under what circumstances.&#10;2.

It is useful for close contact work, such as social engagements and conferences.&#10;3. Super Deluxe model: This is the model that Mr. Faircloth requests from the little man. A Super Deluxe model offers perfect duplication, meaning that it can resemble and replace a specific human being in all aspects. It has all circuits open and no questions asked, making it a desirable choice for those seeking to maintain their privacy and autonomy.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;Paralyzers&quot; likely refers to safety mechanisms built into the androids to prevent them from causing harm or engaging in unauthorized activities.

He could control George Prime and make him do anything he wanted, including telling him what to say and do to make his wife feel special and appreciated.&#10;&#10;2. The man maintained his &quot;sanctuary&quot; against his wife's instinct to clean and rearrange things by building it up and maintaining it over time. He worked diligently and persistently to establish his hideout and ensure that it would stay inviolate.

Our fingerprints were the same. We had the same mannerisms and used the same figures of speech. The only physical difference apparent even to an expert was the tiny finger-depression buried in the hair above his ear. A little pressure there would stop George Prime dead in his tracks.&#10; &#10; He was so lifelike, even I kept forgetting that he was basically just a pile of gears.&#10; &#10; I'd planned very carefully how I meant to use him, of course.&#10; &#10; Every man who's been married eight years has a sanctuary. He builds it up and maintains it against assault in the very teeth of his wife's natural instinct to clean, poke, pry and rearrange things. Sometimes it takes him years of diligent work to establish his hideout and be confident that it will stay inviolate, but if he starts early enough, and sticks with it long enough, and is fierce enough and persistent enough and crafty enough, he'll probably win in the end.

    <node id="Based on the passage provided, Marge's sudden change in behavior and attitude towards her husband is due to her interactions with George Prime, a robot duplicate of the speaker's friend George Faircloth. The narrator realizes that he has been interacting with George Prime instead of his friend George after noticing changes in Marge's behavior and attitude. Marge seems different and more appealing to the narrator when she is around George Prime because the robot is paying her all the attention she wants, telling her what she wants to hear, and making her feel special. The narrator had not been doing these things for Marge, which made her seem more attractive and desirable in his eyes when he saw her responding to George Prime's attentions. Therefore, it seems that Marge's sudden change in behavior and attitude is due to the attention and affection she is receiving from George Prime." />
    <node id="The consequences of George Prime making a decision without consulting the speaker were that he was put in a difficult position where he had to choose between following his own rules for George Prime's behavior and allowing Marge to be happy. George Prime had been instructed to keep Marge happy, and in this instance, that meant going out to buy liquor with her. However, the speaker had also instructed George Prime not to leave the premises. By going out with Marge, George Prime disobeyed the speaker's orders and put him in a difficult situation.&#10;&#10;The speaker's relationship with Marge was affected by this incident because it made him see her in a more positive light. He realized that he had taken Marge for granted and had not been showing her enough attention or affection. When George Prime began paying Marge all the attention she wanted, the speaker suddenly saw her in a new light and appreciated her qualities more fully. This experience led the speaker to reevaluate his relationship with Marge and appreciate her more fully. It is unclear whether he confronted Marge about her interactions with George Prime or how she responded to the revelation that her husband had been replaced by a robot duplicate, but the speaker's perspective on Marge clearly shifted in a positive direction as a result of this experience." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, there is no direct evidence that the speaker had any issues with his marriage being so permanent due to the Family Solidarity Amendment of 196" />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, it is George Prime's behavior and attentiveness that has transformed Marge's demeanor and caused her to appear appealing to the narrator. Specifically, George Prime is paying Marge all the attention she wants, telling her all the things she wants to hear, and making her feel special. The narrator had not been doing these things for Marge, which made her seem more attractive and desirable in his eyes when he saw her responding to George Prime's attentions. It is this change in Marge's behavior due to her interactions with George Prime that has caught the narrator's attention and admiration." />
    <node id="An Ego Prime is a highly advanced robot duplicate of a specific human being, created through the use of technology such as the Neuro-pantograph. It has a completely recorded neurological analogue of the person it is duplicating, allowing it to think and behave in the same way they do. The Ego Prime can do anything that the person tells it to do, making it a useful tool for completing tasks efficiently and effectively.&#10;&#10;However, despite its potential benefits, the Ego Prime is considered indecent and illegal in this society. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as concerns about the potential misuse of the technology, issues of personal identity and autonomy, or fears of creating &quot;perfect&quot; duplicates that could replace or deceive human beings. The fact that Ego Primes are available on the black market for a high price suggests that there is a demand for them despite their illegality.&#10;&#10;The Federal government has imposed strict regulations on the use of Primes, with licenses only granted to certain types of individuals (such as big business executives or movie stars) and regular inspections required to ensure compliance with the law. These laws reflect the society's efforts to balance the potential benefits of the technology with the need to protect individual rights and maintain social order." />

The wonder was that Ego Prime, Inc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the nation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.&#10; &#10; From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the use of Primes right down to the local level.

Hunyadi had no idea in the world what to do with it once he'd invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers bought him body and soul, sub-contracted the problems of anatomy, design, artistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with the modern Ego Primes we have today.&#10; &#10; I spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked outside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it pretty woozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in the recovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Prime when I got him. Finally the door opened and the head technician walked in, followed by a tall, sandy-haired man with worried blue eyes and a tired look on his face.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Meet George Faircloth Prime,&quot; the technician said, grinning at me like a nursing mother.&#10; &#10; I shook hands with myself.

    <node id="Based on the passage provided, George Prime's behavior and attentiveness towards Marge are what led to her changed behavior and increased affection towards her husband. Specifically, George Prime paid Marge all the attention she wanted, told her what she wanted to hear, and made her feel special, which caused her to seem different and more appealing in her husband's eyes. The narrator had not been doing these things for Marge, which made her seem more attractive and desirable in his eyes when he saw her responding to George Prime's attentions. However, it is important to note that George Prime is a robot duplicate of the speaker's friend George Faircloth, not a Super Deluxe model as stated in the question. The reference to George Prime being a Super Deluxe model may have been a mistake or an embellishment added by someone recounting the story." />
    <node id="The story does not provide specific details about the &quot;persistent actions&quot; the speaker took to ensure that no one entered their workshop or how they were able to store George Prime in it without others knowing. However, it can be inferred that the speaker took some measures to keep the workshop private and secure, since George Prime was a highly advanced robot duplicate of the speaker and could potentially cause confusion or harm if discovered by others. It is possible that the speaker installed locks, alarms, or other security systems to protect the workshop and its contents. Additionally, the fact that George Prime was able to be stored in the workshop without being detected suggests that the space may have been soundproofed or otherwise isolated from the rest of the speaker's home or office. However, these are only possibilities, and the story does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about how the speaker ensured the privacy and security of the workshop." />
    <node id="George Prime's strategy for warming up any woman involves spending time telling her all the things she wants to hear and paying all the attention to her that she wants paid to her. This is based on elementary psychology, which George Prime has learned from his basic texts. The reason the narrator has been unsuccessful in making Marge warm up to him is because he hasn't been doing these things for her. He had never managed to warm Marge up much, while George Prime was able to make her seem different and appealing by paying her all the attention she wanted and telling her what she wanted to hear. This highlights the importance of active listening, understanding, and showing interest in one's partner to build a stronger connection and foster warmth in a relationship." />
    <node id="George Prime is a robot duplicate of the speaker's friend, George Faircloth, created through advanced technology. He has remote controls and a completely recorded neurological analogue of the speaker, which allows him to think and behave in the same way the speaker does. George Prime can do anything that the speaker tells him to do, from going to business conferences and making deals to staying home and keeping the speaker's wife happy. He has a complete set of basic texts running in his circuits, giving him a wide range of knowledge and abilities. George Prime is essentially a perfect duplicate of the speaker, capable of performing any task or activity that the speaker can do. The only difference is that George Prime follows the instructions of the speaker without question, making him a useful tool for completing tasks efficiently and effectively." />
    <node id="The speaker's positive response to the revelation that George Prime was a robot duplicate is his newfound appreciation and perspective on his wife Marge. He realizes that she is &quot;really a sweet girl underneath it all&quot; and expresses gratitude for her qualities, such as her cooking skills and attentiveness to his needs. The experience with George Prime has allowed the speaker to see Marge in a more positive light and appreciate her more fully.&#10;&#10;As for their plan for a future trip, the story does not provide explicit details on their second honeymoon plans. However, the speaker expresses a desire to make Marge happy and create temporary corrections for any issues that may arise during their trip. The speaker's realization about George Prime has made him more aware of the importance of paying attention to his wife and fulfilling her needs, so it is likely that he will take steps to ensure a happy and successful trip with Marge, using what he has learned from his experience with George Prime." />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, there is no information suggesting that George Prime has been successful in controlling Marge's actions and thoughts. Instead, it appears that George Prime's attentiveness and behavior have caused Marge to seem different and more appealing to the narrator. Marge wants to spend the evening at home instead of going to a movie because she wants to stay in with her husband, which suggests that she is trying to prioritize their relationship. The passage states, &quot;Marge had never been like the new version of herself that I saw while George Prime was around—wanting to spend the evening at home, for instance, instead of going to a movie.&quot; This statement suggests that Marge's behavior has changed since George Prime started paying her attention and making her feel special. However, there is no indication that George Prime has controlled or manipulated Marge in any way." />
    <node id="The speaker responds positively to the idea of a second honeymoon and plans to go to Hawaii for it. They express a desire to make their wife happy during the trip and create temporary corrections for any issues that may arise.

This may reflect their newfound appreciation for the present moment and their ability to adapt to new situations, as demonstrated by their positive response to George Prime's revelation.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speaker is open to the suggestion of a second honeymoon and plans to make it a successful and enjoyable experience for their wife, while also being receptive to temporary solutions or changes." />

    <node id="1. The first step in obtaining a Super Deluxe model android is to visit the little man's storeroom, where he keeps &quot;blanks&quot; for basic measurements. These blanks are made of clay, putty, and steel, and are faceless and brainless.&#10;2. The little man then takes detailed measurements of the individual, checking measurements of all sorts in a thorough manner. This process is likely used to create a personalized android that resembles and can replace the specific human being.&#10;3. After the measurements have been taken, the individual goes to the little man's laboratory on 14th Street to have the &quot;minute impressions&quot; taken for their personal Prime. It is not specified what this process entails, but it is likely a more detailed and precise method of creating the android.&#10;4. The final product, a Super Deluxe model android, is described as offering perfect duplication, meaning that it can resemble and replace a specific human being in all aspects. It has all circuits open and no questions asked, making it a desirable choice for those seeking to maintain their privacy and autonomy.&#10;5. Based on this description, the blank androids used in the creation process are significantly less advanced and detailed than the final product. The blanks are described as faceless, brainless, and lacking any circuits or programming, whereas the Super Deluxe model has all circuits open and is able to fully replicate a specific human being." />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, the narrator was initially under the impression that his wife had run off with George Prime, the robot duplicate of his friend George Faircloth. However, he later realized that Marge was still at home and that George Prime must have been impersonating him during their interactions.&#10;&#10;The reason the narrator initially thought that Marge had run off with George Prime is not explicitly stated in the passage. It's possible that he simply jumped to this conclusion based on her changed behavior and attitude towards him, as well as the fact that he had left George Prime at home with instructions to keep Marge happy while he was away.&#10;&#10;However, upon further reflection, the narrator realizes that Marge did not actually run off with George Prime. Instead, he concludes that she must have been interacting with George Prime without realizing that he was a robot duplicate of her husband. This is suggested by the fact that Marge seems surprised and confused when the narrator expresses relief that she is still at home: &quot;You're still here! ... You didn't really think I'd go running off with something out of a lab, did you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Overall, while the narrator initially thought that his wife had run off with George Prime, he later realizes that this was not the case. Instead, Marge was simply responding to the attentions and affection of George Prime, who had been instructed by the narrator to keep her happy while he was away." />

He comes to this realization after noticing changes in his wife Marge's behavior and attitude towards him, which he attributes to her interactions with George Prime. The speaker then &quot;turns off&quot; George Prime and drives away in his car, feeling guilty for leaving the robot to deal with Marge but also relieved that he has uncovered the truth.&#10;&#10;This experience changes the speaker's perspective on Marge by making him see her in a more positive light. He reflects on how she had never been like the new version of herself that he saw while George Prime was around, and notes that she is &quot;really a sweet girl underneath it all.&quot; The speaker also expresses appreciation for Marge's qualities, such as her cooking skills and attentiveness to his needs.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speaker's experience with George Prime leads him to reevaluate his relationship with Marge and appreciate her more fully. It is unclear whether he confronts Marge about her interactions with George Prime or how she responds to the revelation that her husband has been replaced by a robot duplicate, but the speaker's perspective on Marge clearly shifts in a positive direction as a result of this experience.">

The bank informed the speaker that all of his regular account had been used up by these checks, which he had forgotten about. The story does not provide enough information to determine what the speaker used the money for, but it is mentioned that he had planned to take a trip to Bermuda with his wife Marge, and that she had always wanted to go there. It is also mentioned that the speaker has a special account that his wife does not know about, but this account had been closed for two weeks.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the speaker's amnesia, which he mentions later in the story, is unrelated to the cashing of the checks and the emptying of his bank account. The amnesia is caused by something else that happens during his conversation with the travel agency.">

And poor Marge, all worked up for a second honeymoon—&#10; &#10; Then it struck me. Poor Marge? Poor sucker George! No Prime in his right circuits would behave this way without some human guidance and that meant only one thing: Marge had spotted him. It had happened before.

George Prime wasn't in his closet. And Marge wasn't in the house.&#10; &#10; They were gone.&#10; &#10; I started to call the police, but caught myself just in time.

However, he later realized that Marge was still at home and that George Prime must have been impersonating him during their interactions.&#10;&#10;The reason the narrator initially thought that Marge had run off with George Prime is not explicitly stated in the passage. It's possible that he simply jumped to this conclusion based on her changed behavior and attitude towards him, as well as the fact that he had left George Prime at home with instructions to keep Marge happy while he was away.&#10;&#10;However, upon further reflection, the narrator realizes that Marge did not actually run off with George Prime. Instead, he concludes that she must have been interacting with George Prime without realizing that he was a robot duplicate of her husband. This is suggested by the fact that Marge seems surprised and confused when the narrator expresses relief that she is still at home: &quot;You're still here! ... You didn't really think I'd go running off with something out of a lab, did you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Overall, while the narrator initially thought that his wife had run off with George Prime, he later realizes that this was not the case. Instead, Marge was simply responding to the attentions and affection of George Prime, who had been instructed by the narrator to keep her happy while he was away.">

The speaker appreciates her qualities such as cooking skills and attentiveness to his needs, which set her apart from the other women he has been with.&#10;&#10;However, when interacting with George Prime, Marge does exhibit some deceptive behavior. She seems different and more appealing to the speaker when George Prime is paying her all the attention she wants, telling her all the things she wants to hear, and making her feel special. The speaker himself had not been doing these things for Marge, which made her seem more attractive and desirable in his eyes when he saw her responding to George Prime's attentions.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Marge is not a robot like George Prime, she does exhibit some changes in behavior when interacting with him that could be considered deceptive. Nonetheless, the speaker still sees her as a sweet and appreciable person compared to the other women he has been with.">

This is based on elementary psychology, which George Prime has learned from his basic texts. The reason the narrator has been unsuccessful in making Marge warm up to him is because he hasn't been doing these things for her. He had never managed to warm Marge up much, while George Prime was able to make her seem different and appealing by paying her all the attention she wanted and telling her what she wanted to hear. This highlights the importance of active listening, understanding, and showing interest in one's partner to build a stronger connection and foster warmth in a relationship.">

The fact that Ego Primes are available on the black market for a high price suggests that there is a demand for them despite their illegality.&#10;&#10;The Federal government has imposed strict regulations on the use of Primes, with licenses only granted to certain types of individuals (such as big business executives or movie stars) and regular inspections required to ensure compliance with the law.

I gripped my cup for dear life and still spilled coffee on my tie.&#10; &#10; As I said, a guy gets fed up.&#10; &#10; And maybe opportunity would only knock once.&#10; &#10; And an Ego Prime would solve all my problems, as Harry had told me.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was completely illegal, of course. The wonder was that Ego Prime, Inc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the nation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.&#10; &#10; From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the use of Primes right down to the local level.

    <edge source="An Ego Prime is a highly advanced robot duplicate of a specific human being, created through the use of technology such as the Neuro-pantograph. It has a completely recorded neurological analogue of the person it is duplicating, allowing it to think and behave in the same way they do. The Ego Prime can do anything that the person tells it to do, making it a useful tool for completing tasks efficiently and effectively.&#10;&#10;However, despite its potential benefits, the Ego Prime is considered indecent and illegal in this society. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as concerns about the potential misuse of the technology, issues of personal identity and autonomy, or fears of creating &quot;perfect&quot; duplicates that could replace or deceive human beings. The fact that Ego Primes are available on the black market for a high price suggests that there is a demand for them despite their illegality.&#10;&#10;The Federal government has imposed strict regulations on the use of Primes, with licenses only granted to certain types of individuals (such as big business executives or movie stars) and regular inspections required to ensure compliance with the law. These laws reflect the society's efforts to balance the potential benefits of the technology with the need to protect individual rights and maintain social order." target=" And that was all there was to it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Practical androids had been a pipe dream until Hunyadi invented the Neuro-pantograph. Hunyadi had no idea in the world what to do with it once he'd invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers bought him body and soul, sub-contracted the problems of anatomy, design, artistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with the modern Ego Primes we have today.&#10; &#10; I spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked outside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it pretty woozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in the recovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Prime when I got him. Finally the door opened and the head technician walked in, followed by a tall, sandy-haired man with worried blue eyes and a tired look on his face.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Meet George Faircloth Prime,&quot; the technician said, grinning at me like a nursing mother.&#10; &#10; I shook hands with myself.

The first step in obtaining a Super Deluxe model android is to visit the little man's storeroom, where he keeps &quot;blanks&quot; for basic measurements. These blanks are made of clay, putty, and steel, and are faceless and brainless.&#10;2. The little man then takes detailed measurements of the individual, checking measurements of all sorts in a thorough manner. This process is likely used to create a personalized android that resembles and can replace the specific human being.&#10;3. After the measurements have been taken, the individual goes to the little man's laboratory on 14th Street to have the &quot;minute impressions&quot; taken for their personal Prime. It is not specified what this process entails, but it is likely a more detailed and precise method of creating the android.&#10;4. The final product, a Super Deluxe model android, is described as offering perfect duplication, meaning that it can resemble and replace a specific human being in all aspects. It has all circuits open and no questions asked, making it a desirable choice for those seeking to maintain their privacy and autonomy.&#10;5. Based on this description, the blank androids used in the creation process are significantly less advanced and detailed than the final product. The blanks are described as faceless, brainless, and lacking any circuits or programming, whereas the Super Deluxe model has all circuits open and is able to fully replicate a specific human being.">

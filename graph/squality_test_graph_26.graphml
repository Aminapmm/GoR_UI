    <node id="The story suggests that the narrator, referred to as &quot;Captain&quot; or &quot;sir,&quot; refused Spinelli's request to be part of the prize crew for the derelict ship because he suspected that Spinelli was motivated by greed after seeing the gold-hunger in his eyes. The Captain wanted to keep a close hand on Spinelli, so he assigned him to stay on board the Maid with him instead. Additionally, when the Captain refused to let Spinelli go, Spinelli became angry and accused the Captain of planning to cheat him of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship. Therefore, the Captain's decision to refuse Spinelli's request was likely motivated by a desire to maintain control of the situation and prevent any conflicts or mutinies arising from greed over the gold." />

Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat him of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister Spinelli,&quot; I said deliberately, &quot;Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is that clear?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Aye, sir,&quot; murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face and there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he turned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like him to let it go at that.&#10; &#10; Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't functioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I rubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering about Spinelli.&#10; &#10; Spinelli talked.

The first impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon every man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be worth money ... lots of money.&#10; &#10; Spinelli said, &quot;Do we look her over, Captain?&quot;&#10; &#10; They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth plenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,&quot; I said sharply.&#10;&quot;Certainly!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was her size.

The only response was a wild swerve in the star-ship's course.

Some of the greed died out of me, and my exertions had&#10; increased my sense of fatigue to an almost numbing weariness. My arms&#10; ached terribly and my hands felt as though they had been sucked dry of&#10; their substance. Like a man in a nightmare, I held them up before my&#10; face and looked at them. They were wrinkled and grey, with the veins&#10; standing out a sickly purple. And I could see that my arms were taking&#10; on that same aged look.&#10; &#10; I was suddenly fully aware of my fear. Nothing fought against the&#10; flood of terror that welled through me. I was terrified of that yellow&#10; gold in my cabin, and of that ship of devil's metal out there in space&#10; that held my shipmates. There was something unnatural about that&#10; contra-terrene thing ... something obscene.&#10; &#10; I located the hulk in the radar finder and swung the Maid after it,&#10; piling on acceleration until my vision flickered. We caught her, the&#10; Maid and I. But" />
    <node id="The narrator's fear and physical exhaustion were caused by their exposure to a mysterious devil-metal from beyond the stars. This metal had drawn energy from the narrator and their crew, causing them to age rapidly and become weak. After realizing the cause of their condition, the narrator took action by throwing all of the alien metal into space and madly fleeing from the golden terror in the sky and its load of ancient evil. The narrator was eventually relieved of their command and acquitted of negligence charges, but they were left with a slowly spreading illness that had started in their hands." />

That&#10; devil-metal from beyond the stars had drawn the energy it needed&#10; from ... us !&#10; &#10; My laughter was a crazy shriek inside my helmet. I looked wildly at the&#10; gleaming walls that had sucked the youth and strength from these men.&#10; The walls were stable, at rest. They were purest gold ... gold ... gold!&#10; &#10; I ran from that place still screaming with the horror of it. My hands&#10; burned like fire! Age was in them, creeping like molten lead through my&#10; veins, ghastly and sure....&#10; &#10; I reached the Maid and threw every scrap of that alien metal into space&#10; as I streaked madly away from that golden terror in the sky and its&#10; load of ancient evil....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted&#10; me of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another&#10; ship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.&#10; Slowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a&#10; spaceman" />
    <node id=". Maybe, thinking about the kind of spacemen my generation produced, you have the idea that if ever we'd so much as laid a hand on anything of value out in space we'd not let go until Hell froze over! Well, you're right about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of civilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of that. We did it for us ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we were, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the risks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there. But there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to all of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no part of the world of men, thick with danger—and horror.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; If you doubt that—and I can see you do—just look at me. I suppose you've never heard of the Martian Maid, and so you don't know the story of what happened to her crew or her skipper. I can give you this much of an answer. I was her skipper. And her crew? They ride high in the sky" />
    <node id=" of the walls deepened. Crazy&#10; little thoughts began spinning around in my brain. Words out of the&#10; distant past loomed up with a new and suddenly terrifying&#10; perspective ... alchemy ... transmutation ... energy. I'm a spaceman,&#10; not a scientist. But in those moments I think I was discovering what&#10; had happened to my crew and why the walls were turning into yellow&#10; metal.&#10; &#10; The lock was closed, but I swung it open and let the pressure in the&#10; chamber rise. I couldn't wait for it to reach fourteen pounds ...&#10; at eleven, I swung the inner door and stumbled eagerly through. The&#10; brilliant light, reflected from gleaming walls blinded me for a moment.&#10; &#10; And then I saw them! They huddled, almost naked in a corner, skeletal&#10; things with skull-like faces that leered at me with the vacuous&#10; obscenity of old age. Even their voices were raw and cracked with the&#10; rusty decay of years. They babbled stupidly, caressing the walls with&#10; claw-like hands. They were old, old!&#10; &#10; I understood then. I knew what my wrinkled aged hands meant. That&#10; devil-metal from beyond the stars had" />
    <node id=" little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were there too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of the metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand. It had a yellowish tinge, and it was heavier ....&#10; &#10; Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held it grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm. Suddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It struck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of metallic lustre.&#10; &#10; For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying all the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a balance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It was no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The whorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing vibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had drawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal—the stuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was built—was now....&#10;  Gold" />
    <node id="The speaker's crew, including the speaker themselves, rapidly aged and weakened due to exposure to a mysterious &quot;devil-metal&quot; from beyond the stars. This metal drew energy from the crew for transmutation, causing them to become old and skeletal. The walls of the spacecraft also turned into yellow metal (gold) due to the same process of transmutation caused by the devil-metal. This is evident when the speaker discovers their aged and weakened shipmates huddled in a corner, caressing the golden walls with claw-like hands. The gold, which was once an unknown metallic substance from the starship, drew energy from the crew to find stability in its new environment as a terrestrial element, thus becoming gold." />

The unknown metal—the stuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was built—was now....&#10;  Gold!&#10; &#10; &#10; I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my table-top. Gold!&#10; &#10; &#10; I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps, from some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ... drawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability in its new environment. Stability as a terrene element—wonderfully, miraculously gold!&#10; &#10; And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of this metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have been a wild sound in those moments of discovery....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the doorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black eyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table. He needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me that his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was the meaning of the expression on his" />

The messages came through garbled two days past turn-over, and both the narrator and Spinelli failed to raise the starship's signal after trying for two hours.&#10;2. The conflict between Spinelli and the narrator revolves around ownership of the derelict treasure ship and its potential gold. Spinelli believes that he has a rightful claim to the ship since he was the one who discovered it. He disobeyed the narrator's orders and told Zaleski about the gold, hoping to secure his share. The narrator, on the other hand, suspects that Spinelli is motivated by greed and wants to maintain control of the situation by assigning him to stay on board the Maid with him instead of letting him join the prize crew for the derelict ship. When the Captain refuses to let Spinelli go, Spinelli becomes angry and accuses the Captain of planning to cheat him of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship. The conflict, therefore, is centered on their differing views regarding ownership and control of the potential treasure." />

Distrust.&#10; &#10; For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat to clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first place I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the second place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.&#10; &#10; I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and I was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that there was no double-cross.&#10; &#10; I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the rest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk. That way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the treasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they were to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.&#10; &#10; I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with that starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; As the days passed and we reached turn-over with the hulk still well within visual range, I noticed a definite decrease in the number of messages from Cohn. The Aldis Lamps no longer blinked back at the Maid eight or ten times a day, and I began to really regret not having taken the time to equip the starship with UHF radio communicators.&#10; &#10; Each night I slept with a hunk of yellow gold under my bunk, and ridiculously I fondled the stuff and dreamed of all the things I would have when the starship was cut up and sold.&#10; &#10; My weariness grew. It became almost chronic, and I soon wondered if I hadn't picked up a touch of space-radiation fever. The flesh of my hands seemed paler than it had been. My arms felt heavy. I determined to report myself to the Foundation medics on Callisto. There's no telling what can happen to a man in space....&#10; &#10; Two days past turn-over the messages from the derelict came through garbled.

Earlier, the Captain had refused to let Spinelli join the prize crew for the derelict ship because he suspected that Spinelli was motivated by greed after seeing the gold-hunger in his eyes. Instead, the Captain assigned him to stay on board the Maid with him.&#10;2. When the Captain refused to let Spinelli go, Spinelli became angry and accused the Captain of planning to cheat him of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.

    <node id="Based on the information provided, the derelict starship is of an unknown origin and is significantly larger than any ship built by the Foundation Yards. It is not designed for interplanetary flight and has likely come from distant stars, or even beyond, as evidenced by its trajectory from Coma Berenices. The ship's appearance is alien and its hull material has strange, tiny whorls that seem unstable or possibly alive.&#10;&#10;The starship appears to be abandoned or in distress, as it is drifting in a hyperbolic orbit around the Sun, which will take it out into interstellar space again. The ship's pressure hull is made of an unusual metal that is heavy and has magnetic properties, suggesting advanced technology. Unfortunately, the ship's interior has been severely damaged, making it impossible to determine its original purpose or where it came from. Despite this, there is interest in salvaging the starship due to the potential value of its materials and technology." />
    <node id=".&#10;&quot;Certainly!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was her size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained such gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand feet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable alienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully in the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with something like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff were somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some strange and alien way.&#10; &#10; It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for inter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of mystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave her birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was unthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she was drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung about Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away again into the inter-stellar deeps.&#10; " />

It wasn't long before I discovered that the derelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something about its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer, and showed him my figures.&#10; &#10; &quot;Mister Cohn,&quot; I said, chart in hand, &quot;do these figures look right to you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures. It didn't take him long to check me. &quot;The math is quite correct, Captain,&quot; he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of those figures on the chart.&#10; &#10; &quot;Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,&quot; I ordered.&#10; &#10; The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug of the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations.

    <node id="The Martian Maid was a chemical-fueled spaceship, two hundred feet long and armed, that opened up the spaceways. Its crew, including Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, and Zaleski, were a rough bunch of men with a great lust for high pay and hard living.

The narrator, who was the skipper of the Martian Maid, was an ordinary man who didn't know that he was starting out on his last flight when he stood in the valve of the Maid, watching the loading cranes pull away.&#10;&#10;One day, the crew found a derelict ship on a near collision course with the Martian Maid. The narrator fixed the radar on the derelict and computed its orbit, which was strange. He then assembled the ship's company and showed them his figures, indicating that the derelict ship was either abandoned or in distress. However, the crew's unreasoning, unthinking love for gold and their greed led them to take over the derelict ship, which turned out to be a trap. The crew was reduced to jelly at fifty thousand yards by the six-inch supersonic projector abaft the astrogation turret of the derelict ship. The narrator, who had set the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict and kept it aimed dead at it, was the only survivor. He watched as the Maid followed under a steady one G of acceleration with most of her controls on automatic, carrying his greedy crew to their doom. The narrator was left alone, riding high in the sky on a golden ship that his crew had paid for with all the years of their lives." />

And all because they were men, and men are greedy and hasty and full of an unreasoning, unthinking love for gold. They ride a golden ship that they paid for with all the years of their lives. It's all theirs now. Bought and paid for.&#10; &#10; It wasn't too long ago that I lifted the Maid off Solis Lacus on that last flight. Not many of you will remember her class of ship, so many advances have been made in the last few years. The Maid was two hundred feet from tip to tail, and as sleek a spacer as ever came out of the Foundation Yards. Chemical fueled, she was nothing at all like the spherical hyperdrives we see today. She was armed, too. The Foundation still thought of space as a possible stamping ground for alien creatures though no evidence of any extra-terrestrial life had ever been found ... then.&#10; &#10; My crew was a rough bunch, like all those early crews.

That's the kind of men that opened up the spaceways, too. Don't believe all this talk about the noble pioneering spirit of man. That's tripe. There never has been such a thing as a noble pioneer. Not in space or anywhere else. It is the malcontent and the adventuring mercenary that pushes the frontier outward.&#10; &#10; I didn't know, that night as I stood in the valve of the Maid, watching the loading cranes pull away, that I was starting out on my last flight. I don't think any of the others could have guessed, either. It was the sort of night that you only see on Mars.

The Captain denied Spinelli's request to join the prize crew for the derelict ship because he suspected that Spinelli was motivated by greed after seeing his intense interest in the gold found on the derelict ship.&#10;2. The Captain wanted to maintain control of the situation and prevent any conflicts or mutinies arising from greed over the gold. By assigning Spinelli to stay on board the Maid with him, the Captain could keep a close eye on him and avoid potential problems.&#10;3. Spinelli's actions after being denied the request, such as disobeying orders and telling Zaleski about the potential gold on the derelict ship, further confirmed the Captain's suspicion that he was motivated by greed and not trustworthy in this situation." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, the plan for repairing the damaged spaceship involves jury-rigging a spare pulse-jet and bringing the ship down under its own power. Mister Marvin and Zaleski are tasked with assembling the spare pulse-jet. The protagonist will take charge of provisioning the ship, which includes checking the compartments they found and installing oxy-generators aboard. Once these tasks are completed, they are to report to the protagonist in his quarters.&#10;&#10;The discovered properties of the ship's metal hull, specifically its heaviness and apparent energy-absorbing qualities, do not directly impact the plan for repairing the ship. However, the fact that the metal is a form of gold may have implications for the financial aspect of the salvage operation. The protagonist initially expresses excitement about the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship, so it is possible that they plan to sell the gold hull for a profit once repairs are complete." />
    <node id="1. Origin of the derelict starship: The story suggests that the starship is of an unknown origin and has likely come from distant stars or even beyond, as evidenced by its trajectory from Coma Berenices. Its appearance is alien, and its hull material has strange, tiny whorls that seem unstable or possibly alive. The ship is not designed for interplanetary flight and is drifting in a hyperbolic orbit around the Sun, which will take it out into interstellar space again.&#10;2. Proceeding with examining the derelict starship: Given the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship, it would be wise to proceed with examining it. The protagonist has already claimed the ship as salvage, and the crew is eager to examine it for financial gain. However, there are risks involved, as exhibited by the fear and excitement among the crew when they consider the possibility that the ship came from beyond the stars.&#10;3. Implications for the financial aspect of the salvage operation: The protagonist expresses excitement about the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship. Specifically, the fact that the ship's metal hull is a form of gold could have significant implications for the financial gain from salvaging the ship. It is possible that they plan to sell the gold hull for a profit once repairs are complete.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to proceed with examining the derelict starship for potential financial gain, while also acknowledging the risks and uncertainties surrounding its origin and purpose." />

    <node id="Based on the story, it can be inferred that Spinelli was dissatisfied with the Captain's decision to keep him on board the Maid and not let him join the prize crew for the derelict ship. Despite agreeing to stay on board and not speak of the gold to the crew, Spinelli murmured something to Zaleski, which caused tension and distrust. This action suggests that Spinelli was still motivated by greed and wanted to secure his share of the potential gold on the derelict ship. By murmuring something to Zaleski, Spinelli may have been trying to form an alliance with him or inform him of the Captain's plan to claim the treasure for himself. Overall, Spinelli's actions indicate that he was not content with the current situation and was looking for a way to secure his rightful share of the potential gold on the derelict ship." />
    <node id="1. Greed is a powerful motivator: Spinelli's intense interest in the gold found on the derelict ship and his subsequent actions confirm that greed can drive people to make impulsive and reckless decisions.&#10;2. The desire for treasure can lead to conflict and mistrust: Captain Midas's suspicion of Spinelli's motives and his decision to keep a close eye on him highlight how the lure of treasure can create divisions and conflicts within groups.&#10;3. There is no such thing as free treasure: The story emphasizes the idea that every great treasure comes with a cost, whether it be in terms of physical effort, emotional pain, or loss of life.&#10;4. Humans are fallible and prone to making mistakes: Captain Midas's decision to keep the derelict ship for himself and his crew, rather than reporting it to the authorities, ultimately leads to their downfall. This highlights the dangers of human hubris and the potential consequences of taking shortcuts or cutting corners.&#10;5. Treasure can bring both joy and sorrow: The fact that Captain Midas looks eighty at the age of thirty-two, despite his youthful appearance before the discovery of the derelict ship, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and the potential costs of seeking great treasure." />

The dangerous journey referred to in the story is when the narrator, also known as Captain Midas, is getting into a pressure suit and entering the derelict spacecraft that his ship, the Martian Maid, had caught and was following. Despite suspecting that the derelict spaceship might be a trap or in distress, the greedy crew of the Martian Maid, including Spinelli, took over the derelict ship, which led to their deaths when they were reduced to jelly by the six-inch supersonic projector. The narrator was the only survivor and witnessed his crew's demise.&#10;&#10;The dangerous journey is described as such because the narrator knows that there are strange things in space that don't respond to human laws or theories, and he has a sense of foreboding about what might happen when he enters the derelict spaceship. The yellowish cast on the decks, the lack of tiny questing force-whorls, and the deepening saffron of the walls all serve as ominous signs that something is not right. Despite these risks, the narrator proceeds to enter the derelict spacecraft, which ultimately leads him to discover the mysterious devil-metal from beyond the stars, causing his rapid aging and illness.&#10;&#10;In summary, the dangerous journey refers to the narrator's decision to enter the derelict spaceship despite knowing that it might be a trap or in distress, and the potential dangers of encountering strange things in space that don't respond to human laws or theories.

The cursed treasure that the destitute and elderly man, referred to as Captain Midas, encountered in his past as a spaceman is a golden derelict spaceship that he and his crew discovered while in space. This treasure brought great wealth but also came with a cost, as it caused the rapid aging and illness of Captain Midas. He is sharing this story on his hospital cot because people often laugh at him when he tells them what happened, calling him by his nickname, Captain Midas. By sharing his story, he may be hoping to validate his experiences and warn others about the dangers of greed and the pursuit of treasure.&#10;2. The dangerous journey referred to in the story is when Captain Midas and his crew boarded the derelict spaceship, which ultimately led to their downfall. This journey was dangerous because there were strange things in space that didn't respond to human laws or theories, and the narrator had a sense of foreboding about what might happen when they entered the ship. Despite these risks, the crew proceeded to board the ship, leading them to discover the cursed treasure that brought great wealth but also caused their downfall.&#10;3.

It appeared different from any ship they had seen before, with a much larger size than any Foundation Yards ship. Its appearance was alien and it had an unusual hull material with tiny whorls that seemed unstable or possibly alive.&#10;2. The initial reactions of those who observed the space hulk through the telescope were shock and excitement. They immediately started counting their share of the salvage money, indicating their assumption that the ship was abandoned or in distress and could be claimed as salvage. The ship's large size and unusual appearance added to the sense of intrigue and potential value.&#10;3. The ship's origin is unknown, but its trajectory from Coma Berenices and alien appearance suggest that it came from distant stars or even beyond.

That kind of unreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.&#10; &#10; There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that Spinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one of us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money.

However, despite these risks, the narrator proceeded to enter the derelict spacecraft, which ultimately led him to discover the mysterious devil-metal from beyond the stars, causing his rapid aging and illness.">

No ship" target="1. Origin of the derelict starship: The story suggests that the starship is of an unknown origin and has likely come from distant stars or even beyond, as evidenced by its trajectory from Coma Berenices. Its appearance is alien, and its hull material has strange, tiny whorls that seem unstable or possibly alive. The ship is not designed for interplanetary flight and is drifting in a hyperbolic orbit around the Sun, which will take it out into interstellar space again.&#10;2. Proceeding with examining the derelict starship: Given the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship, it would be wise to proceed with examining it. The protagonist has already claimed the ship as salvage, and the crew is eager to examine it for financial gain. However, there are risks involved, as exhibited by the fear and excitement among the crew when they consider the possibility that the ship came from beyond the stars.&#10;3. Implications for the financial aspect of the salvage operation: The protagonist expresses excitement about the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship. Specifically, the fact that the ship's metal hull is a form of gold could have significant implications for the financial gain from salvaging the ship. It is possible that they plan to sell the gold hull for a profit once repairs are complete.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to proceed with examining the derelict starship for potential financial gain, while also acknowledging the risks and uncertainties surrounding its origin and purpose.">

And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she was drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung about Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away again into the inter-stellar deeps.&#10; ">

Origin of the derelict starship: The story suggests that the starship is of an unknown origin and has likely come from distant stars or even beyond, as evidenced by its trajectory from Coma Berenices. Its appearance is alien, and its hull material has strange, tiny whorls that seem unstable or possibly alive. The ship is not designed for interplanetary flight and is drifting in a hyperbolic orbit around the Sun, which will take it out into interstellar space again.&#10;2. Proceeding with examining the derelict starship: Given the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship, it would be wise to proceed with examining it. The protagonist has already claimed the ship as salvage, and the crew is eager to examine it for financial gain. However, there are risks involved, as exhibited by the fear and excitement among the crew when they consider the possibility that the ship came from beyond the stars.&#10;3. Implications for the financial aspect of the salvage operation: The protagonist expresses excitement about the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship.

Its crew, including Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, and Zaleski, were a rough bunch of men with a great lust for high pay and hard living. They were not noble pioneers but malcontents and adventuring mercenaries. The narrator, who was the skipper of the Martian Maid, was an ordinary man who didn't know that he was starting out on his last flight when he stood in the valve of the Maid, watching the loading cranes pull away.&#10;&#10;One day, the crew found a derelict ship on a near collision course with the Martian Maid. The narrator fixed the radar on the derelict and computed its orbit, which was strange. He then assembled the ship's company and showed them his figures, indicating that the derelict ship was either abandoned or in distress. However, the crew's unreasoning, unthinking love for gold and their greed led them to take over the derelict ship, which turned out to be a trap. The crew was reduced to jelly at fifty thousand yards by the six-inch supersonic projector abaft the astrogation turret of the derelict ship. The narrator, who had set the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict and kept it aimed dead at it, was the only survivor. He watched as the Maid followed under a steady one G of acceleration with most of her controls on automatic, carrying his greedy crew to their doom. The narrator was left alone, riding high in the sky on a golden ship that his crew had paid for with all the years of their lives.">

She was armed, too. The Foundation still thought of space as a possible stamping ground for alien creatures though no evidence of any extra-terrestrial life had ever been found ... then.&#10; &#10; My crew was a rough bunch, like all those early crews. I remember them so well. Lean, hungry men with hell in their eyes and a" target="The greedy and hasty crew members of the Maid ship were Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, and Zaleski. They were a rough bunch of men who were more interested in high pay and hard living than in advancing civilization. Their unreasoning and unthinking love for gold led them to take over a derelict ship, which turned out to be a trap, resulting in their deaths. They missed the advancements made in space travel after the Maid's class became outdated, as they paid for their greed with all the years of their lives, leaving the speaker, their skipper, alone on a golden ship.">

The dangerous journey that the protagonist, Captain Midas, was undertaking while battling with his failing hands and struggling to get into a pressure suit was entering the derelict spaceship that his ship, the Martian Maid, had caught and was following. Despite suspecting that the derelict spaceship might be a trap or in distress, the greedy crew of the Martian Maid, including Spinelli, took over the derelict ship, which led to their deaths when they were reduced to jelly by the six-inch supersonic projector.

    <edge source="1. The sighting of the mysterious space hulk was made through a telescope from a distance of ten thousand miles. It appeared different from any ship they had seen before, with a much larger size than any Foundation Yards ship. Its appearance was alien and it had an unusual hull material with tiny whorls that seemed unstable or possibly alive.&#10;2. The initial reactions of those who observed the space hulk through the telescope were shock and excitement. They immediately started counting their share of the salvage money, indicating their assumption that the ship was abandoned or in distress and could be claimed as salvage. The ship's large size and unusual appearance added to the sense of intrigue and potential value.&#10;3. The ship's origin is unknown, but its trajectory from Coma Berenices and alien appearance suggest that it came from distant stars or even beyond. Its hyperbolic orbit around the Sun will take it out into interstellar space again, indicating its inability to sustain itself in a planetary system.&#10;4. Given the potential value of the materials and technology aboard the ship, it would be wise to proceed with examining it cautiously while also acknowledging the risks and uncertainties surrounding its origin and purpose. There may be ethical considerations to take into account when claiming salvage rights, especially if the origins of the ship are unknown and it may belong to another civilization. It would be important to approach the situation with care and respect for possible cultural or legal implications." target=" reported it from the forward scope position. I assumed it was a Foundation ship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of developing spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole responsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never in history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial intelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just assumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of unreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.&#10; &#10; There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that Spinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one of us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All this before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!&#10; &#10; All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope I saw that there was something different about this one. At such a distance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass, but I could see that the hulk was big—bigger than any ship I'd ever seen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my slide rule to Control.">

The signal from the starship is winking out feebly, suggesting that the hand holding the lamp that is blinking out the message is shaking and the mind conceiving the words is failing. This makes it difficult for the narrator and Spinelli to read the signal.&#10;2. Spinelli believes that Zaleski has disobeyed orders regarding the gold because he saw Spinelli murmuring something to Zaleski, which created tension and distrust in the air. Spinelli may have been trying to form an alliance with Zaleski or inform him of the Captain's plan to claim the treasure for himself, leading Spinelli to suspect that Zaleski has disobeyed orders regarding the gold." target="The unknown metallic substance that was transformed into gold is an unidentified metal from a distant island universe where matter reacts differently. This metal draws energy from its environment to find stability as a terrestrial element, and in this case, it transformed into gold.

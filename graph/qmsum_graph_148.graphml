Goal: The goal is the desired outcome or endpoint of the SPG action. It could be a specific location, state, or condition that is achieved after completing the source and path components.&#10;&#10;These three aspects are considered mutually exclusive because they represent distinct elements of the SPG action: the starting point, the process to reach the goal, and the desired outcome." />
    <node id=" say it 's either one of them or it can be none , or it can be any of them . However the uh {disfmarker} it seems to be sensible to me to r to view them as mutually exclusive um maybe even not .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: J Do you mean within the Source - Path - Goal actions ?&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: uh {vocalsound} ye uh uh b I uh I {disfmarker} u I understand&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Those three ?&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: uh but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: And um how {disfmarker} how where is the end ? So that 's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: No , no . There {disfmarker} a a actually by I think my question is simpler than that , um {vocalsound} is {disfmarker} OK , so you have an SPG action and {disfmarker} and it has three different um uh aspects um because you can either enter a building" />
    <node id=": Grad E&#10;Content: I 'm sure there 's a commercial event schema in there somewhere .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Oop . I {vocalsound} d f&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah , a &quot; commercial event &quot; or something .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Yeah I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah ? So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so we would {disfmarker} we would instantiate the SPG schema with a Source - Path - Goal blah - blah - blah&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: I see .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: and the buying event you know at which {disfmarker} however that looks like , the place f thing to buy .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Uh - huh . Uh - huh . Interesting . Would you say that the {disfmarker} like {disfmarker} I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things , but there 's also this sort of like causal , well , so one is really facilitating" />
    <node id=" 's just an additional information {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Exactly . In the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an {disfmarker} an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Right ? that doesn't hurt the current way . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Which {disfmarker} which we 're abbreviating as &quot; RAD &quot; .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: which is {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Good .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Rad !&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: So um you had like an action schema and a Source - Path - Goal schema ,&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Hmm . Hmm . Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: right ? So how does this Source - Path - Goal schema fit into the uh action schema ? Like is it one of the tags there" />
    <node id=": Yeah , the {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: s Source it will be , you know we 'll f we know a lot about sources so we 'll put all of that in Source .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: But it 's independent whether we are using the SPG schema in an Enter , View , or Approach mode , right ?&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: This is just properties of the SPG {comment} schema . We can talk about Paths being the fastest , the quickest , the nicest and so forth , uh or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} and the Trajector should be coming in there as well .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: And then G the same about Goals .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: OK . So I guess the question is when you actually fill" />
    <node id="marker} These actions {disfmarker} I don't know if I 'm gonna answer your question or not with this , but the categories inside of action schemas , so , SPG action is a category . Real although I think what we 're specifying here is this is a category where the actions &quot; enter , view and approach &quot; would fall into because they have a related Source - Path - Goal schema in our tourist domain . Cuz viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and {disfmarker} or actually going from one place to another to take a picture , in this {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: Right . Oh , s so it 's sort of automatic derived fr from the structure that {disfmarker} that is built elsewhere .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: derived I don't know if I u&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: This is a cate this a category structure here ,&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: right ? Action schema . What are some types of action schemas ? Well one of the types of action schemas" />
    <node id=" could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things , but there 's also this sort of like causal , well , so one is really facilitating the other and it 's part of a compound action of some kind , which has structure .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah . Now it 's technically possible that you can fit schema within schema , and schema within schemata {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: uh I {disfmarker} I think that 's nicer for a lot of reasons but might be a pain so uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: um Well , for me it seems that uh {disfmarker} r Yes .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once , but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Well , if I 'm {disfmarker} if I 'm recipient of such a message and I get a Source - Path - Goal where the goal is a bakery" />
    <node id="The 'sort of' issue being discussed in the transcript is related to the conceptualization and representation of actions or processes. They are discussing a data structure, possibly an action schema, which has different components such as Source-Path-Goal (SPG). There seems to be some confusion about how this SPG action is triggered or chosen and how it is represented or displayed.&#10;&#10;The mention of shadows in the context of pointing at a screen is because one of the participants (Grad B) was looking at the hand of the speaker (Grad G) rather than the shadow being used as a pointer. This discrepancy between what Grad B was expecting to look at (the shadow) and what they were actually looking at (the hand) may be analogous to their confusion about the SPG action, where there might be some mismatch between the expected representation or trigger of the action and its actual form in the data structure.&#10;&#10;In summary, the 'sort of' issue being discussed is the conceptualization and implementation of actions within a data structure, and the shadow-pointing discrepancy highlights the confusion arising from unmet expectations regarding visual representations." />
    <node id=" was sort of a {disfmarker} it gave us some headache , how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the Enter Source - Path - Goal that this {disfmarker} But this sort of gets the job done in that respect and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we 're talking about two different things . We 're talking more on the sort of intention level , up there , and more on the {disfmarker} this is the {disfmarker} your basic bone um schema , down there .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Uh one question , Robert . When you point at the screen is it your shadow that I 'm supposed to look at ?&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Yeah . It 's the shadow .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: OK . Whereas I keep looking where your hand is , and it doesn't {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Well , that wouldn't have helped you at all .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Basically , what this is" />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, it is not explicitly stated that the friend mentioned meeting at a bakery as the reason for going there.

    <node id="The M-3-LA API provides means to identify identical concepts between an action description and the S Source-Path-Goal schema through linking.

    <node id="isfmarker} that 's one {disfmarker} one thing is that we can link up , think also that um we can have one or m as many as we want links from {disfmarker} from the schema up to the s action um description of it .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: But the notion I got from Nancy 's idea was that we may f find sort of concepts floating around i in the a action description of the action f &quot; Enter &quot; frame up there that are , e when you talk about the real world , actually identical to the goal of the {disfmarker} the S Source - Path - Goal schema ,&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Exactly .

    <node id="m - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: or how do they work in f terms of other things .

So the question is are um {disfmarker} how to represent when things are linked in a certain way . So we know for Enter that there 's Container potentially involved&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: and it 's not {disfmarker} uh I don't know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema SPG schema it {disfmarker} it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the Source - Path - Goal um you know goal {disfmarker} uh goal I guess in this case .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content" />

    <node id="1. Discussion: The graduates and PhD candidates are planning to have a discussion about the EDU Project, specifically focusing on modifying the SmartKom parser and natural language generation module. The meeting is scheduled for Friday at an unspecified time between the transcript and Friday.&#10;&#10;2. Bhaskara's Involvement: Bhaskara will be giving a &quot;big show&quot; or presentation during the discussion on Friday. It seems that he has been involved with the project from its beginning, as mentioned by Grad C when introducing him.&#10;&#10;3. Short Summary Preparation: The participants have agreed to prepare a short summary or version of the discussion. The content and format of this summary are not specified in the transcript.&#10;&#10;4. Meeting Time Rescheduling: Due to some conflicts with previously scheduled meetings, the group has decided to move the meeting to Friday at 2:30-ish. This change was made because Grad B, who has a class until 2 PM, cannot participate if the meeting runs over into his class time. Bhaskara is also mentioned as having had input on the new meeting time, although he will not be running over from another event.&#10;&#10;5. Introduction: During the conversation, Grad C introduced some of the project members who may be less familiar to others in the group, including Johno and Bhaskara." />

In the given transcript, the example of the SPG schema used is &quot;Enter.&quot;&#10;2. The buying snacks schema: Although not explicitly named in the transcript, it can be inferred as a separate schema because Grad C discusses two different schemas - the Source-Path-Goal schema and another one related to buying something to eat at a bakery (the buying snacks schema).&#10;&#10;Grad G confirms that both of these schemas will be listed under the action schema, which is mentioned in the context of organizing actions and their respective domain objects.

    <node id="1. The Source-Path-Goal (SPG) schema is a structure used to represent actions that involve an object or agent transitioning from one location to another, with components for the source, path, and goal. In this transcript, it is discussed in the context of &quot;Enter&quot; mode.&#10;2. Another schema mentioned is related to buying something, which can be inferred as the &quot;buying snacks&quot; schema. This schema is distinct from the SPG schema and will also be listed under the action schema.&#10;3. The properties of paths and trajectors, as well as goals, can affect the final output when creating content using the SPG schema by providing more specific details about the nature of the source, path, and goal. For example, describing paths as &quot;the fastest&quot; or &quot;the nicest&quot; can help create a more vivid and engaging narrative.&#10;4. The discussion also mentions the possibility of having multiple schemas instantiated simultaneously, such as an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks. However, there is no way to enforce this connection between schemas within the system.&#10;5. When using the SPG schema in &quot;Enter&quot; mode, understanding that &quot;Enter&quot; is an SPG action can help users look for and fill in appropriate roles (source, path, goal) in the schema, which in turn affects the final output by ensuring all necessary components are included." />

    <node id="The idea is to create a high-level categorized list of abstract tasks for the user to choose from, allowing them to create their own itinerary and complete specific tasks.

The goal is to enable users to make their own choices regarding where they want to go and what they want to do, while still having some guidance in the form of high-level categories anchored to real-world places in Heidelberg. This approach aims to provide a more natural interaction for the user, allowing them to engage with the system in a more intuitive way." />

    <node id="1. Action schemas help organize and categorize actions along with their respective domain objects and rich action descriptions, making it easier for the system to understand and process user intents by distinguishing between various action types.&#10;2. Action schemas can provide a more vivid and engaging narrative by offering properties like paths and trajectors, as well as goals, which offer specific details about the source, path, and goal of an action.&#10;3. Action schemas enable better linking and identification of identical concepts through APIs like M-3-LA, improving parsing and analysis of natural language utterances by connecting elements in a schema to the action description.&#10;4. Multiple schemas can be instantiated simultaneously, as in the example of an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks. While there is no way to enforce connections between schemas within the system, understanding that &quot;Enter&quot; is an SPG action helps users look for and fill in appropriate roles (source, path, goal) in the schema, ensuring all necessary components are included.&#10;5. Action schemas provide a reverse organization option by enabling categorization of actions like &quot;enter, view, and approach,&quot; which share related Source-Path-Goal schemas in specific domains like tourism, enhancing automatic derivation of categories from the structure built elsewhere.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, action schemas are useful for organizing, linking, and identifying various types of actions and their components, offering a more structured method for processing user intents and deriving meaningful information compared to making the information an attribute of something else." />
    <node id="1. The system being discussed uses &quot;modules&quot; that can be activated based on certain conditions. In this transcript, it is mentioned that only one module can be activated at a time, specifically in the context of the &quot;Enter,&quot; &quot;View,&quot; and &quot;Approach&quot; actions from the Source-Path-Goal schema.&#10;2. Grad C brings up the possibility of having two modules active simultaneously, but the other participants are unsure about this capability or how it would work. They mention that there is no way to enforce connections between multiple schemas within the system.&#10;3. When the module for the &quot;Enter&quot; action is activated, the modules for &quot;View&quot; and &quot;Approach&quot; will not be active. This is because these actions are distinct and cannot occur simultaneously in the context of the Source-Path-Goal schema.&#10;4. The discussion also touches upon the idea that some concepts from the real world may be identical to goals in the SPG schema, such as entering a building being equivalent to achieving the goal of an Enter action. The system has means of identifying these connections through its API." />

    <node id="1. Purpose of providing a schematic tourist map: The primary goal of giving users a schematic tourist map is to enable them to have a more natural and intuitive interaction with the system. Instead of asking the system for high-level information about locations, users can refer to the map, which contains symbols for different objects and places in Heidelberg.&#10;&#10;2. Effect on accessing high-level information: The schematic tourist map helps users make their own choices about where they want to go and what they want to do by allowing them to take notes directly on the map regarding specific intentions (e.g., shopping, taking pictures, eating). This way, users can engage with the system more organically, using their preferences as a guide for interacting with the system.&#10;&#10;In summary, the purpose of providing a schematic tourist map is to allow users to have a more natural and intuitive experience when engaging with the system by accessing high-level information through the map itself rather than asking the system for that information. Users can then make personalized notes on the map about their intentions, which facilitates a more enjoyable and tailored interaction with the system." />

Goals: The properties of goals that will be discussed and filled in for any SPG mode include specifying the desired outcome or endpoint of the action. This could be a particular location, state, or condition achieved after completing the source and path components.&#10;&#10;These properties are not tied to a specific SPG mode (Enter, View, or Approach) and can be applied generally to better understand and describe the Source-Path-Goal schema in various contexts." />

    <node id="1. The purpose of creating high-level categories of abstract tasks is to provide users with a structured way to choose activities they want to do in Heidelberg, such as &quot;go shopping&quot; or &quot;visit sightseeing places.&quot; These categories help users make personalized itineraries based on their interests and preferences.&#10;&#10;2. Users can utilize these categories by selecting a few that appeal to them, then deciding where and when they would like to complete the tasks related to those categories. For example, if there is a category called &quot;emptying your roll of film,&quot; the user can choose a specific location in Heidelberg to take pictures and fill their roll of film.&#10;&#10;3. Users are given a schematic tourist map with symbols for different objects and locations in Heidelberg, where they can make notes about their intentions regarding specific places or tasks (e.g., shopping, taking pictures, eating). This allows users to engage with the system more organically by using their preferences as a guide for interacting with the system.&#10;&#10;4. Since users cannot bring the list of high-level categories with them, they can rely on their notes and the map to remember their chosen activities and locations. The system will not have multiple modules active simultaneously; instead, it will activate modules based on specific conditions, such as the &quot;Enter,&quot; &quot;View,&quot; and &quot;Approach&quot; actions from the Source-Path-Goal schema." />

This means that the developers can start using it now, but some technical details are still being worked out.&#10;2. In this context, pointers work as references from roles in the schema to action schemas. For example, when certain concepts or &quot;floating around&quot; in the action description match the goal of the S Source-Path-Goal schema, they can be linked and identified as identical through these pointers (references). This linking mechanism allows for identifying identical concepts between an action description and the SPG schema." />

    <node id="The speakers, who appear to be scholars or researchers, are discussing a proposal to add an additional structure to their current system for describing actions. This new structure would include not only an object and an action, as in their current model, but also a &quot;rich action description.&quot; They abbreviate this concept as &quot;RAD,&quot; which stands for Rich Action Description.&#10;&#10;The speakers seem to be debating how this new RAD structure would fit into their existing schema, particularly in relation to an &quot;action schema&quot; and a &quot;Source-Path-Goal (SPG) schema.&quot; They also discuss the possibility of using the RAD structure to describe actions that are not just physical or concrete, but also abstract or intangible.&#10;&#10;One speaker suggests using a laser pointer to illustrate their ideas, while another mentions the idea of &quot;intentions&quot; and how they could be filled out using the new RAD structure. They also discuss the potential benefits of using the term &quot;description&quot; in the name of this new structure, as well as the importance of making it &quot;hip&quot; and appealing to younger generations.&#10;&#10;Towards the end of the transcript, the speakers begin to discuss the idea of adding this new RAD structure to existing XML schemas that define messages passed between modules in their system.

    <node id="The map provided to users is a schematic tourist map, which means it is a simplified, symbolic representation of various objects and locations in Heidelberg. It does not contain detailed street networks, making it different from traditional maps. Instead, users can find symbols for different places or types of attractions on the map. This design allows users to make their own choices about where they want to go and what they want to do by allowing them to take notes directly on the map regarding specific intentions (e.g., shopping, taking pictures, eating).&#10;&#10;By using this schematic tourist map, users can engage with the system more organically, as they are not required to ask the system for high-level information about locations. The notes they take on the map will help them remember their chosen activities and locations, while the system will activate modules based on specific conditions like &quot;Enter,&quot; &quot;View,&quot; and &quot;Approach&quot; actions from the Source-Path-Goal schema. Overall, the schematic tourist map aims to provide a more natural interaction for users by allowing them to use their preferences as a guide when engaging with the system." />

This new structure would include not only an object and an action, as in their current model, but also a &quot;rich action description.&quot; They abbreviate this concept as &quot;RAD,&quot; which stands for Rich Action Description.&#10;&#10;The speakers seem to be debating how this new RAD structure would fit into their existing schema, particularly in relation to an &quot;action schema&quot; and a &quot;Source-Path-Goal (SPG) schema.&quot; They also discuss the possibility of using the RAD structure to describe actions that are not just physical or concrete, but also abstract or intangible.&#10;&#10;One speaker suggests using a laser pointer to illustrate their ideas, while another mentions the idea of &quot;intentions&quot; and how they could be filled out using the new RAD structure. They also discuss the potential benefits of using the term &quot;description&quot; in the name of this new structure, as well as the importance of making it &quot;hip&quot; and appealing to younger generations.&#10;&#10;Towards the end of the transcript, the speakers begin to discuss the idea of adding this new RAD structure to existing XML schemas that define messages passed between modules in their system. They mention the need for compatibility with existing systems and the potential drawbacks of requiring each module to look up information about entities and actions in a centralized database.">

The Source-Path-Goal (SPG) schema is a structure used to represent actions that involve an object or agent transitioning from one location to another, with components for the source, path, and goal. In this transcript, it is discussed in the context of &quot;Enter&quot; mode.&#10;2. Another schema mentioned is related to buying something, which can be inferred as the &quot;buying snacks&quot; schema. This schema is distinct from the SPG schema and will also be listed under the action schema.&#10;3. The properties of paths and trajectors, as well as goals, can affect the final output when creating content using the SPG schema by providing more specific details about the nature of the source, path, and goal. For example, describing paths as &quot;the fastest&quot; or &quot;the nicest&quot; can help create a more vivid and engaging narrative.&#10;4. The discussion also mentions the possibility of having multiple schemas instantiated simultaneously, such as an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks. However, there is no way to enforce this connection between schemas within the system.&#10;5. When using the SPG schema in &quot;Enter&quot; mode, understanding that &quot;Enter&quot; is an SPG action can help users look for and fill in appropriate roles (source, path, goal) in the schema, which in turn affects the final output by ensuring all necessary components are included.">

Action schemas help organize and categorize actions along with their respective domain objects and rich action descriptions, making it easier for the system to understand and process user intents by distinguishing between various action types.&#10;2. Action schemas can provide a more vivid and engaging narrative by offering properties like paths and trajectors, as well as goals, which offer specific details about the source, path, and goal of an action.&#10;3. Action schemas enable better linking and identification of identical concepts through APIs like M-3-LA, improving parsing and analysis of natural language utterances by connecting elements in a schema to the action description.&#10;4. Multiple schemas can be instantiated simultaneously, as in the example of an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks. While there is no way to enforce connections between schemas within the system, understanding that &quot;Enter&quot; is an SPG action helps users look for and fill in appropriate roles (source, path, goal) in the schema, ensuring all necessary components are included.&#10;5. Action schemas provide a reverse organization option by enabling categorization of actions like &quot;enter, view, and approach,&quot; which share related Source-Path-Goal schemas in specific domains like tourism, enhancing automatic derivation of categories from the structure built elsewhere.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, action schemas are useful for organizing, linking, and identifying various types of actions and their components, offering a more structured method for processing user intents and deriving meaningful information compared to making the information an attribute of something else.">

This discrepancy between what Grad B was expecting to look at (the shadow) and what they were actually looking at (the hand) may be analogous to their confusion about the SPG action, where there might be some mismatch between the expected representation or trigger of the action and its actual form in the data structure.&#10;&#10;In summary, the 'sort of' issue being discussed is the conceptualization and implementation of actions within a data structure, and the shadow-pointing discrepancy highlights the confusion arising from unmet expectations regarding visual representations." target=" Undergrad D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: whenever .&#10;Speaker: Undergrad D&#10;Content: But yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: You are more than welcome if you think that this kind of discussion gets you anywhere in {disfmarker} in your life then uh you 're free to c&#10;Speaker: Undergrad D&#10;Content: It 's fascinating .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: &quot; That 's the right answer . &quot;&#10;Speaker: Undergrad D&#10;Content: I 'm just glad that I don't have to work it out&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: &#10;Speaker: Undergrad D&#10;Content: because .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Hmm ?&#10;Speaker: Undergrad D&#10;Content: I 'm just glad that don't have to work it out myself , that I 'm not involved at all in the working out of it because .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Uh but you 're a linguist .&#10;Speaker: Grad E&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: You">

Grad C brings up the possibility of having two modules active simultaneously, but the other participants are unsure about this capability or how it would work. They mention that there is no way to enforce connections between multiple schemas within the system.&#10;3. When the module for the &quot;Enter&quot; action is activated, the modules for &quot;View&quot; and &quot;Approach&quot; will not be active. This is because these actions are distinct and cannot occur simultaneously in the context of the Source-Path-Goal schema.&#10;4. The discussion also touches upon the idea that some concepts from the real world may be identical to goals in the SPG schema, such as entering a building being equivalent to achieving the goal of an Enter action. The system has means of identifying these connections through its API.">

Action schemas help organize and categorize actions along with their respective domain objects and rich action descriptions, making it easier for the system to understand and process user intents by distinguishing between various action types.&#10;2. Action schemas can provide a more vivid and engaging narrative by offering properties like paths and trajectors, as well as goals, which offer specific details about the source, path, and goal of an action.&#10;3. Action schemas enable better linking and identification of identical concepts through APIs like M-3-LA, improving parsing and analysis of natural language utterances by connecting elements in a schema to the action description.&#10;4. Multiple schemas can be instantiated simultaneously, as in the example of an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks. While there is no way to enforce connections between schemas within the system, understanding that &quot;Enter&quot; is an SPG action helps users look for and fill in appropriate roles (source, path, goal) in the schema, ensuring all necessary components are included.&#10;5. Action schemas provide a reverse organization option by enabling categorization of actions like &quot;enter, view, and approach,&quot; which share related Source-Path-Goal schemas in specific domains like tourism, enhancing automatic derivation of categories from the structure built elsewhere.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, action schemas are useful for organizing, linking, and identifying various types of actions and their components, offering a more structured method for processing user intents and deriving meaningful information compared to making the information an attribute of something else.">

Grad C brings up the possibility of having two modules active simultaneously, but the other participants are unsure about this capability or how it would work. They mention that there is no way to enforce connections between multiple schemas within the system.&#10;3. When the module for the &quot;Enter&quot; action is activated, the modules for &quot;View&quot; and &quot;Approach&quot; will not be active. This is because these actions are distinct and cannot occur simultaneously in the context of the Source-Path-Goal schema.&#10;4. The discussion also touches upon the idea that some concepts from the real world may be identical to goals in the SPG schema, such as entering a building being equivalent to achieving the goal of an Enter action. The system has means of identifying these connections through its API.">

Action schemas help organize and categorize actions along with their respective domain objects and rich action descriptions, making it easier for the system to understand and process user intents by distinguishing between various action types.&#10;2. Action schemas can provide a more vivid and engaging narrative by offering properties like paths and trajectors, as well as goals, which offer specific details about the source, path, and goal of an action.&#10;3. Action schemas enable better linking and identification of identical concepts through APIs like M-3-LA, improving parsing and analysis of natural language utterances by connecting elements in a schema to the action description.&#10;4. Multiple schemas can be instantiated simultaneously, as in the example of an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks.

Action schemas help organize and categorize actions along with their respective domain objects and rich action descriptions, making it easier for the system to understand and process user intents by distinguishing between various action types.&#10;2. Action schemas can provide a more vivid and engaging narrative by offering properties like paths and trajectors, as well as goals, which offer specific details about the source, path, and goal of an action.&#10;3. Action schemas enable better linking and identification of identical concepts through APIs like M-3-LA, improving parsing and analysis of natural language utterances by connecting elements in a schema to the action description.&#10;4. Multiple schemas can be instantiated simultaneously, as in the example of an SPG schema for entering a bakery and a separate buying event schema when purchasing snacks. While there is no way to enforce connections between schemas within the system, understanding that &quot;Enter&quot; is an SPG action helps users look for and fill in appropriate roles (source, path, goal) in the schema, ensuring all necessary components are included.&#10;5. Action schemas provide a reverse organization option by enabling categorization of actions like &quot;enter, view, and approach,&quot; which share related Source-Path-Goal schemas in specific domains like tourism, enhancing automatic derivation of categories from the structure built elsewhere.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, action schemas are useful for organizing, linking, and identifying various types of actions and their components, offering a more structured method for processing user intents and deriving meaningful information compared to making the information an attribute of something else." target="The purpose of having categories for actions in addition to their corresponding schema definitions in the 'action schema' section is to provide a more organized and structured way of processing user intents and deriving meaningful information.

Users can utilize these categories by selecting a few that appeal to them, then deciding where and when they would like to complete the tasks related to those categories.

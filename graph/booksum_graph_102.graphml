    <node id="based on the narrative, it seems unlikely that Carol will be able to transform Gopher Prairie's focus from modernity back to simplicity. The town has already exchanged its &quot;Money Musk&quot; for phonographs grinding out ragtime and has embraced modern conveniences such as hot-water heat and electric lights. Furthermore, Carol herself acknowledges that she cannot plant anything in a wall so smooth and sun-glazed as the mediocrity of Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's acquaintance with the Perrys, two pioneers who had lost their wealth and moved into smaller living arrangements, may factor into this goal by providing her with a connection to the town's past and a deeper understanding of its history. However, it is unlikely that this connection alone will be enough to turn back the tide of modernity in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol might instead focus on finding ways to preserve and celebrate the town's unique character and history while still embracing modern conveniences. She could work to promote cultural and historical preservation efforts, or she could try to find ways to incorporate traditional elements into the town's modern developments. Ultimately, any efforts to change the direction of Gopher Prairie would likely require a significant shift in the mindset and values of the town's residents, and it is unclear from the narrative whether Carol has the influence and support necessary to make such a change." />

Carol had none of the&#10;superiority she felt toward Mrs. Lyman Cass's plutocratic parlor. She&#10;was at home here. She noted with tenderness all the makeshifts: the&#10;darned chair-arms, the patent rocker covered with sleazy cretonne, the&#10;pasted strips of paper mending the birch-bark napkin-rings labeled &quot;Papa&quot;&#10;and &quot;Mama.&quot;&#10;&#10;She hinted of her new enthusiasm. To find one of the &quot;young folks&quot; who&#10;took them seriously, heartened the Perrys, and she easily drew from&#10;them the principles by which Gopher Prairie should be born again--should&#10;again become amusing to live in.&#10;&#10;This was their philosophy complete . . . in the era of aeroplanes and&#10;syndicalism:&#10;&#10;The Baptist Church (and, somewhat less, the Methodist, Congregational,&#10;and Presbyterian Churches) is the perfect, the divinely ordained&#10;standard in music, oratory, philanthropy, and ethics. &quot;We don't need&#10;all this new-f" />

During the gossip after the meeting Mrs. George Edwin Mott&#10;remarked that the city hall seemed inadequate for the splendid modern&#10;Gopher Prairie. Mrs. Nat Hicks timidly wished that the young people&#10;could have free dances there--the lodge dances were so exclusive. The&#10;city hall. That was it! Carol hurried home.&#10;&#10;She had not realized that Gopher Prairie was a city. From Kennicott she&#10;discovered that it was legally organized with a mayor and city-council&#10;and wards. She was delighted by the simplicity of voting one's self a&#10;metropolis. Why not?&#10;&#10;She was a proud and patriotic citizen, all evening.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;II&#10;&#10;&#10;She examined the city hall, next morning.

This smug in-between town, which had exchanged &quot;Money&#10;Musk&quot; for phonographs grinding out ragtime, it was neither the heroic&#10;old nor the sophisticated new. Couldn't she somehow, some yet unimagined&#10;how, turn it back to simplicity?&#10;&#10;She herself knew two of the pioneers: the Perrys. Champ Perry was the&#10;buyer at the grain-elevator. He weighed wagons of wheat on a rough&#10;platform-scale, in the cracks of which the kernels sprouted every&#10;spring. Between times he napped in the dusty peace of his office.&#10;&#10;She called on the Perrys at their rooms above Howland &amp; Gould's grocery.&#10;&#10;When they were already old they had lost the money, which they had&#10;invested in an elevator. They had given up their beloved yellow brick&#10;house and moved into these rooms over a store, which were the Gopher&#10;Prairie equivalent of a flat.

Daily Carol&#10;walked from town into flashing country hysteric with new life.&#10;&#10;One enchanted hour when she returned to youth and a belief in the&#10;possibility of beauty.&#10;&#10;She had walked northward toward the upper shore of Plover Lake, taking&#10;to the railroad track, whose directness and dryness make it the natural&#10;highway for pedestrians on the plains.

Why, I thought everybody from the Twin&#10;Cities always said it was such a beautiful town!&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol forswore herself; declared that Gopher Prairie had the color of&#10;Algiers and the gaiety of Mardi Gras.&#10;&#10;Yet the next afternoon she was pouncing on Mrs. Lyman Cass, the&#10;hook-nosed consort of the owner of the flour-mill.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Cass's parlor belonged to the crammed-Victorian school, as Mrs.&#10;Luke Dawson's belonged to the bare-Victorian. It was furnished on two&#10;principles: First, everything must resemble something else. A rocker had&#10;a back like a lyre, a near-leather seat imitating tufted cloth, and&#10;arms like Scotch Presbyterian lions; with knobs, scrolls, shields, and&#10;spear-points on unexpected portions of the chair. The second principle&#10;of the crammed-Victorian school was that every inch of the interior must" />

She was loyal enough but not ardent, and without&#10;ever quite intending to, she began to neglect the task as heat sucked at&#10;her strength.&#10;&#10;Kennicott and she motored North and spent a week with his mother--that&#10;is, Carol spent it with his mother, while he fished for bass.&#10;&#10;The great event was their purchase of a summer cottage, down on Lake&#10;Minniemashie.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the most amiable feature of life in Gopher Prairie was the&#10;summer cottages. They were merely two-room shanties, with a seepage of&#10;broken-down chairs, peeling veneered tables, chromos pasted on wooden&#10;walls, and inefficient kerosene stoves. They were so thin-walled and so&#10;close together that you could--and did--hear a baby being spanked in the&#10;fifth cottage off. But they were set among elms and lindens on a bluff&#10;which looked across the lake to fields of ripened wheat sloping up to&#10;green woods.&#10;&#10;Here the matrons forgot social jealous" />

Dance-halls: The speaker sees no need for dance-halls because she believes that dancing is not what it used to be, with young folks neglecting the Lord's injunction for modesty and indulging in &quot;terrible Turkey Trots and hugging.&quot; She implies that they manage well at the K.P. Hall and the Oddfellows', but some lodges do not welcome foreigners and hired help to their dances. In her day, people used to dance modestly and have just as much fun.&#10;&#10;2. Farm-bureaus: The speaker does not see the need for a farm-bureau because she thinks that in her day, boys learned to farm by honest sweating. She believes that every gal could cook, or her ma taught her how. There is also a county agent at Wakamin who comes once every two weeks.&#10;&#10;3. Domestic science demonstrations: The speaker does not understand the necessity for domestic science demonstrations as she thinks girls should learn to cook from their mothers.&#10;&#10;In the speaker's time, young people had fun by dancing modestly and enjoying themselves just as much as young folks do now. They learned necessary skills through hard work and personal interactions, such as boys learning to farm from experience and girls learning homemaking skills from their mothers. The narrative suggests that dance-halls, farm-bureaus, and domestic science demonstrations were not yet recognized as essential institutions for fostering social activities and skill development during the speaker's time." />

My house was roofed&#10;with hay and it leaked something terrible when it rained--only dry place&#10;was under a shelf.&#10;&#10;&quot;And when the town grew up we thought the new city hall was real fine.&#10;And I don't see any need for dance-halls. Dancing isn't what it was,&#10;anyway. We used to dance modest, and we had just as much fun as all&#10;these young folks do now with their terrible Turkey Trots and hugging&#10;and all. But if they must neglect the Lord's injunction that young girls&#10;ought to be modest, then I guess they manage pretty well at the K.&#10;P. Hall and the Oddfellows', even if some of tie lodges don't always&#10;welcome a lot of these foreigners and hired help to all their dances.&#10;And I certainly don't see any need of a farm-bureau or this domestic&#10;science demonstration you talk about. In my day the boys learned to farm&#10;by honest sweating, and every gal could cook, or her ma learned her&#10;how across her knee! Besides, ain't there a county agent at Wakamin?

    <node id=" I have no doubt that such villages will be found on the&#10;prairie--some day. But if I might make just the least little criticism:&#10;it seems to me that you are wrong in supposing either that the city hall&#10;would be the proper start, or that the Thanatopsis would be the right&#10;instrument. After all, it's the churches, isn't it, that are the&#10;real heart of the community. As you may possibly know, my husband&#10;is prominent in Congregational circles all through the state for&#10;his advocacy of church-union. He hopes to see all the evangelical&#10;denominations joined in one strong body, opposing Catholicism and&#10;Christian Science, and properly guiding all movements that make for&#10;morality and prohibition. Here, the combined churches could afford&#10;a splendid club-house, maybe a stucco and half-timber building with&#10;gargoyles and all sorts of pleasing decorations on it, which, it seems&#10;to me, would be lots better to impress the ordinary class of people than&#10;just a plain old-fashioned colonial house, such as you describe.

Burns&#10;had to work hard and was sometimes led by evil companionship into low&#10;habits. But it is morally instructive to know that he was a good&#10;student and educated himself, in striking contrast to the loose ways and&#10;so-called aristocratic society-life of Lord Byron, on which I have just&#10;spoken.

But&#10;Carol was after something bigger than dances.&#10;&#10;In the afternoon she scampered to the public library.&#10;&#10;The library was open three afternoons and four evenings a week. It was&#10;housed in an old dwelling, sufficient but unattractive. Carol caught&#10;herself picturing pleasanter reading-rooms, chairs for children, an art&#10;collection, a librarian young enough to experiment.&#10;&#10;She berated herself, &quot;Stop this fever of reforming everything! I WILL be&#10;satisfied with the library! The city hall is enough for a beginning.&#10;And it's really an excellent library. It's--it isn't so bad. . . . Is&#10;it possible that I am to find dishonesties and stupidity in every&#10;human activity I encounter? In schools and business and government and&#10;everything? Is there never any contentment, never any rest?&quot;&#10;&#10;She shook her head as though she were shaking off water, and hastened&#10;into the library, a young, light, amiable presence, modest in unbuttoned&#10;fur coat, blue suit," />
    <node id="Robert Burns was a Scottish poet and lyricist born in 1759, who did not have the same educational advantages as many of his contemporaries. He is self-taught and worked hard despite sometimes being led into low habits by evil companionship. His life is in stark contrast to the aristocratic society-life of his time, as exemplified by Lord Byron.&#10;&#10;While Burns did not have access to formal education, he was still a good student who educated himself. He is known for his pieces about rustic subjects and their message of humble beauty. In comparison, Lord Byron led a loose lifestyle and belonged to the aristocracy, which may have looked down upon Burns' humble background.&#10;&#10;Despite this, many people have greatly enjoyed Burns' works, including his poem about a mouse and other rustic subjects. This shows that one does not need a formal education or an aristocratic background to create meaningful and appreciated pieces of literature." />

He&#10;lived in London, England, and in Stratford-on-Avon, which many American&#10;tourists loved to visit, a lovely town with many curios and old houses&#10;well worth examination. Many people believed that Shakespeare was the&#10;greatest play-wright who ever lived, also a fine poet. Not much was&#10;known about his life, but after all that did not really make so much&#10;difference, because they loved to read his numerous plays, several of&#10;the best known of which she would now criticize.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the best known of his plays was &quot;" />

He spoke of her&#10;new jade and cream frock naturally, not jocosely; he held her chair&#10;for her as they sat down to dinner; and he did not, like Kennicott,&#10;interrupt her to shout, &quot;Oh say, speaking of that, I heard a good story&#10;today.&quot; But Guy was incurably hermit. He sat late and talked hard, and&#10;did not come again.&#10;&#10;Then she met Champ Perry in the post-office--and decided that in the&#10;history of the pioneers was the panacea for Gopher Prairie, for all&#10;of America.

They have to be cautious about their actions, particularly in terms of sex morals and appearance, which can cause them to suppress their true desires and feelings.&#10;2. Loss of Authenticity: The constant pressure to maintain a certain image and abide by traditional norms can make it difficult for the ruling-class to express themselves genuinely or explore their individuality. This leads to a lack of authenticity in their lives, as they feel forced to conform to societal expectations rather than follow their own desires and values.&#10;3.

As a result, the town risks becoming stagnant and resistant to change, which can negatively impact its growth and development.&#10;4. Social Isolation: Members of the ruling-class may feel socially isolated due to their elevated status, as they are constantly under scrutiny and may not have close relationships with people outside their social circle. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from the community.&#10;5.

He feels trapped by the virus, which has made him resistant to change and new challenges. The virus has caused him to become complacent and content with his current situation, even though he knows that he could achieve more if he were to leave the small town behind.&#10;&#10;The character's struggle with the &quot;Village Virus&quot; highlights the challenges that ambitious individuals face when they remain in small towns for too long. While there may be benefits to living in a smaller community, such as a slower pace of life and close-knit relationships, there are also limitations that can hinder personal and professional growth. The &quot;Village Virus&quot; is a metaphorical representation of these limitations, illustrating the difficulty of leaving behind familiar surroundings and pursuing new opportunities." />

    <node id="Robert Burns (1759-1796) was a Scottish poet and lyricist who is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland. Despite not having the same educational advantages as many of his contemporaries, Burns was self-taught and worked hard, although he was sometimes led into low habits by evil companionship. His life stands in contrast to the aristocratic society-life of his contemporary, Lord Byron.&#10;&#10;Burns is known for his pieces about rustic subjects, which reflect his humble background and convey a message of humble beauty. In comparison, Lord Byron led a loose lifestyle and belonged to the aristocracy, which may have looked down upon Burns' humble origins. However, Burns' works have been greatly enjoyed by many people, including his poem about a mouse and other rustic subjects, demonstrating that one does not need a formal education or an aristocratic background to create meaningful and appreciated literature.&#10;&#10;Mrs. George Edwin Mott highlighted the social differences between Burns and Lord Byron in her speech, emphasizing that Burns was a good student who educated himself, while Lord Byron led a loose lifestyle and belonged to the aristocracy.

    <node id="In the text, the unnecessary troubles that people create for themselves include a tendency to manufacture misery through conflicts and divisions, even when there are no real reasons for them. The narrator explains that humans have &quot;Nature beaten&quot; and can control their environment with advancements like growing wheat and keeping warm during blizzards. However, instead of living harmoniously, people engage in activities that create discord, such as wars, politics, and racism.&#10;&#10;In Gopher Prairie specifically, people artificially make themselves unhappy by focusing on petty differences and engaging in destructive competition. For example, the text mentions &quot;commercial hatred&quot; where grocers feel contempt for those who don't do business with them. This kind of behavior creates unnecessary divisions and tension within the community, contributing to an overall sense of unhappiness and discontent.&#10;&#10;People engage in these actions because they have become accustomed to seeking pleasure from conflict and competition, even if it comes at a great cost. The text suggests that this behavior is deeply ingrained in the Anglo-Saxon cultural tradition, making it difficult for individuals to break free from its grip. However, by recognizing these patterns of behavior and working to overcome them, people can create more harmonious communities and improve their overall well-being." />

Carol's grand vision for the Thanatopsis Club was to create a new Georgian town with a variety of public spaces and facilities, including a city hall, public library, art gallery, rest-room and model kitchen for farmwives, theater, lecture room, community ballroom, farm-bureau, and gymnasium. She envisioned this as a central hub that would benefit not only Gopher Prairie but also the surrounding countryside.&#10;2. Carol planned to transform a wire-fenced potato-plot into a walled rose-garden in half an hour by using her creativity and determination. However, the narrative does not provide specific details about how she intended to accomplish this task. The transformation is likely symbolic of her desire to bring beauty and positive change to Gopher Prairie through the Thanatopsis Club.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Carol's vision for the Thanatopsis Club does not come to fruition, as her ideas are met with resistance from other club members.

    <node id="1. Skepticism towards scientific farming: The character expresses skepticism about scientific farming, suggesting that there is &quot;nothing to it&quot; and implying that traditional farming methods are sufficient. They also mention a county agent who comes once every two weeks, which might be seen as enough support for farmers.&#10;&#10;2. Preference for lectures in churches: Instead of supporting the idea of holding lectures in a lecture hall, the character believes that listening to sermons in churches is a better alternative. This reflects their attachment to traditional ways and their preference for religious teachings over &quot;heathen learning.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Opposition to changing architecture style: The character strongly opposes changing the town's architecture to Colonial style, claiming that it would not resemble the place they love. They cherish the current appearance of the town with its trees, lawns, and comfy houses. This opposition to change showcases their comfort with the status quo and resistance to new ideas, which aligns with the concept of the &quot;Village Virus.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Carol reacts to the public library with a mix of disappointment and understanding. She finds the library insufficient and unattractive but acknowledges that it is not so bad, shaking off her initial judgment. This reaction shows her eagerness for improvement while also revealing her struggle with finding flaws in every human activity she encounters.&#10;2. Carol's aspirations for community improvements are revealed through her thoughts about the library and its potential for more resources, better facilities, and a young librarian open to experimentation. Despite catching herself wanting to reform everything, she decides to focus on being content with the existing library, emphasizing her desire to bring positive change rather than simply criticize.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's reaction to the public library shows both her aspiration for community improvements and her struggle with her expectations of finding flaws in human activities. She wishes to enhance the library while acknowledging its current state, illustrating her constructive approach towards community development." />
    <node id="1. Carol's husband, Dr. Will Kennicott, believes that church-union can create a better community center compared to building a city hall or relying on the Thanatopsis. He is prominent in Congregational circles and advocates for all evangelical denominations to unite as one strong body. This combined force would oppose Catholicism and Christian Science, guiding moral and prohibition movements. In this united church, Dr. Kennicott envisions a splendid club-house that would serve as the heart of the community, offering a stucco and half-timber building with gargoyles and other decorations to impress people. He sees this as a more effective center for educational and pleasurable activities than the city hall or Thanatopsis." />

In terms of personality, Mrs. Dyer was open and friendly enough to converse with Carol and other women in the community. Despite her unremarkable dwelling, she had a noticeable presence and contributed to the link between two contrasting groups in the town.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Mrs. Dyer's physical dwelling may not have been particularly memorable, she played a significant role as a social connector in the reborn town, which made a positive impression on Carol despite her struggles with finding flaws in various human activities." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Carol Kennicott seeks out Luke Dawson, an elderly resident of Gopher Prairie, to ask him if he is a millionaire after realizing that she lacks someone to share her vision for rebuilding the town. This sudden action can be interpreted as a sign of Carol's desperation and determination to find a way to implement her ideas for improving the community.&#10;&#10;Carol has faced resistance from other club members in her efforts to transform the Thanatopsis Club and the city hall, and she recognizes that she needs financial resources to make any significant changes in Gopher Prairie. In her conversation with Mr. Dawson, she expresses her idea for rebuilding the town and likely hopes that he might be able to provide some financial support or influence to help make it a reality.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Carol has a history of seeking out unconventional allies in her quest for change, such as when she turned to Guy Pollock for companionship and understanding. In this case, she turns to an elderly resident who may have a different perspective on the town's history and values than some of the younger, more commercially-minded men in the city council.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's sudden seeking out of Luke Dawson can be seen as a strategic move to find a way to implement her vision for improving Gopher Prairie, despite the resistance she has faced from other members of the community." />

To keep up an outdoor life during winter, Carol tried to persuade the other women in town to join her in sliding and skating activities.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott played a significant role in the Thanatopsis organization's establishment of a rest-room. However, she only became passionate about it after inspecting the facility. This shift in enthusiasm is not explicitly stated in the narrative but can be inferred based on her character and vision for improving Gopher Prairie through the Thanatopsis Club.&#10;&#10;Carol Kennicott has consistently shown a desire to bring beauty, positive change, and practical assistance to Gopher Prairie through the Thanatopsis Club. She proposes several initiatives aimed at empowering the less fortunate members of their community by offering self-help opportunities, such as an employment bureau, classes on essential life skills, and a municipal fund for home-building.&#10;&#10;When it comes to the rest-room establishment, Carol's passion for this specific project likely stems from her firsthand inspection of the facility. As she inspects the rest-room, she notices its shortcomings and the potential improvements that could be made. This experience allows her to see the direct impact of her efforts in improving the quality of life for the community members who use this facility.&#10;&#10;Thus, while the narrative does not provide specific details on why Carol only became passionate about the rest-room establishment after inspecting it, her character and vision suggest that she became engaged with this project due to its tangible benefits and direct impact on the community." />

The text suggests that people should be content with their earnings and not strive for more than what is deemed appropriate.&#10;3. Role of Religion in Society: Religion plays a significant role in the traditional viewpoint presented in this text. The speaker asserts that the Republican Party, or the Grand Old Party of Blaine and McKinley, is the agent of the Lord and of the Baptist Church in temporal affairs. This implies that religion should have a strong influence on political and social matters, and those who do not adhere to these religious beliefs are seen as threats to society's moral fabric." />

But I&#10;must say it seems to me we should lose the whole point of the thing by&#10;not regarding it as charity. Why, that's the chief adornment of the true&#10;Christian and the church! The Bible has laid it down for our guidance.&#10;'Faith, Hope, and CHARITY,' it says, and, 'The poor ye have with ye&#10;always,' which indicates that there never can be anything to these&#10;so-called scientific schemes for abolishing charity, never! And isn't it&#10;better so? I should hate to think of a world in which we were deprived&#10;of all the pleasure of giving. Besides, if these shiftless folks realize&#10;they're getting charity, and not something to which they have a right,&#10;they're so much more grateful.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="In Chapter XI of the narrative, Carol Kennicott goes for a walk in the spring to reaffirm her belief in the beauty of nature. She starts by walking on the railroad track, stepping from tie to tie in long strides. At each road-crossing, she crawls over a cattle-guard of sharpened timbers. Along the way, she enjoys the sight of buttercups, pasque flowers, and kinnikinic brush. She then crawls through a rusty barbed-wire fence and follows a furrow between low wheat blades and a field of rye. Eventually, she reaches a pasture by the lake, which is covered in rag-baby blossoms and Indian tobacco. The path that Carol takes on her walk involves traversing the railroad track, crossing through fields, and reaching a lake, all while appreciating the beauty of nature around her." />

So sprinkled was the pasture with&#10;rag-baby blossoms and the cottony herb of Indian tobacco that it spread&#10;out like a rare old Persian carpet of cream and rose and delicate green.&#10;Under her feet the rough grass made a pleasant crunching. Sweet winds&#10;blew from the sunny lake beside her, and small waves sputtered on the&#10;meadowy shore. She leaped a tiny creek bowered in pussy-willow buds. She&#10;was nearing a frivolous grove of birch and poplar and wild plum trees.&#10;&#10;The poplar foliage had the downiness of a Corot arbor; the green and&#10;silver trunks were as candid as the birches, as slender and lustrous&#10;as the limbs of a Pierrot.

Despite her unremarkable dwelling, she had a noticeable presence and contributed to the link between two contrasting groups in the town.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Mrs. Dyer's physical dwelling may not have been particularly memorable, she played a significant role as a social connector in the reborn town, which made a positive impression on Carol despite her struggles with finding flaws in various human activities.">

    <edge source="based on the narrative, it seems unlikely that Carol will be able to transform Gopher Prairie's focus from modernity back to simplicity. The town has already exchanged its &quot;Money Musk&quot; for phonographs grinding out ragtime and has embraced modern conveniences such as hot-water heat and electric lights. Furthermore, Carol herself acknowledges that she cannot plant anything in a wall so smooth and sun-glazed as the mediocrity of Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's acquaintance with the Perrys, two pioneers who had lost their wealth and moved into smaller living arrangements, may factor into this goal by providing her with a connection to the town's past and a deeper understanding of its history. However, it is unlikely that this connection alone will be enough to turn back the tide of modernity in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol might instead focus on finding ways to preserve and celebrate the town's unique character and history while still embracing modern conveniences. She could work to promote cultural and historical preservation efforts, or she could try to find ways to incorporate traditional elements into the town's modern developments. Ultimately, any efforts to change the direction of Gopher Prairie would likely require a significant shift in the mindset and values of the town's residents, and it is unclear from the narrative whether Carol has the influence and support necessary to make such a change." target="Based on the narrative, Carol Kennicott seeks out Luke Dawson, an elderly resident of Gopher Prairie, to ask him if he is a millionaire after realizing that she lacks someone to share her vision for rebuilding the town.

In her conversation with Mr. Dawson, she expresses her idea for rebuilding the town and likely hopes that he might be able to provide some financial support or influence to help make it a reality.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Carol has a history of seeking out unconventional allies in her quest for change, such as when she turned to Guy Pollock for companionship and understanding. In this case, she turns to an elderly resident who may have a different perspective on the town's history and values than some of the younger, more commercially-minded men in the city council.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's sudden seeking out of Luke Dawson can be seen as a strategic move to find a way to implement her vision for improving Gopher Prairie, despite the resistance she has faced from other members of the community.">

However, instead of living harmoniously, people engage in activities that create discord, such as wars, politics, and racism.&#10;&#10;In Gopher Prairie specifically, people artificially make themselves unhappy by focusing on petty differences and engaging in destructive competition. For example, the text mentions &quot;commercial hatred&quot; where grocers feel contempt for those who don't do business with them. This kind of behavior creates unnecessary divisions and tension within the community, contributing to an overall sense of unhappiness and discontent.&#10;&#10;People engage in these actions because they have become accustomed to seeking pleasure from conflict and competition, even if it comes at a great cost. The text suggests that this behavior is deeply ingrained in the Anglo-Saxon cultural tradition, making it difficult for individuals to break free from its grip. However, by recognizing these patterns of behavior and working to overcome them, people can create more harmonious communities and improve their overall well-being.">

Hypocrisy: The ruling-class members of Gopher Prairie are unable to live up to the high moral standards they are expected to uphold, leading to hypocrisy. They have to be cautious about their actions, particularly in terms of sex morals and appearance, which can cause them to suppress their true desires and feelings.&#10;2. Loss of Authenticity: The constant pressure to maintain a certain image and abide by traditional norms can make it difficult for the ruling-class to express themselves genuinely or explore their individuality. This leads to a lack of authenticity in their lives, as they feel forced to conform to societal expectations rather than follow their own desires and values.&#10;3. Stifled Creativity: The rigid social structure and narrow-mindedness in Gopher Prairie can hinder creativity and innovation. As a result, the town risks becoming stagnant and resistant to change, which can negatively impact its growth and development.&#10;4. Social Isolation: Members of the ruling-class may feel socially isolated due to their elevated status, as they are constantly under scrutiny and may not have close relationships with people outside their social circle. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from the community.&#10;5. Reduced Personal Freedom: The pressure to conform to high moral standards can limit the personal freedom of ruling-class individuals. They may feel trapped by societal expectations, which can affect their overall well-being and happiness.">

Hypocrisy: The ruling-class members of Gopher Prairie are unable to live up to the high moral standards they are expected to uphold, leading to hypocrisy. They have to be cautious about their actions, particularly in terms of sex morals and appearance, which can cause them to suppress their true desires and feelings.&#10;2. Loss of Authenticity: The constant pressure to maintain a certain image and abide by traditional norms can make it difficult for the ruling-class to express themselves genuinely or explore their individuality. This leads to a lack of authenticity in their lives, as they feel forced to conform to societal expectations rather than follow their own desires and values.&#10;3. Stifled Creativity: The rigid social structure and narrow-mindedness in Gopher Prairie can hinder creativity and innovation. As a result, the town risks becoming stagnant and resistant to change, which can negatively impact its growth and development.&#10;4. Social Isolation: Members of the ruling-class may feel socially isolated due to their elevated status, as they are constantly under scrutiny and may not have close relationships with people outside their social circle. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from the community.&#10;5. Reduced Personal Freedom: The pressure to conform to high moral standards can limit the personal freedom of ruling-class individuals.

The narrator explains that humans have &quot;Nature beaten&quot; and can control their environment with advancements like growing wheat and keeping warm during blizzards. However, instead of living harmoniously, people engage in activities that create discord, such as wars, politics, and racism.&#10;&#10;In Gopher Prairie specifically, people artificially make themselves unhappy by focusing on petty differences and engaging in destructive competition. For example, the text mentions &quot;commercial hatred&quot; where grocers feel contempt for those who don't do business with them. This kind of behavior creates unnecessary divisions and tension within the community, contributing to an overall sense of unhappiness and discontent.&#10;&#10;People engage in these actions because they have become accustomed to seeking pleasure from conflict and competition, even if it comes at a great cost. The text suggests that this behavior is deeply ingrained in the Anglo-Saxon cultural tradition, making it difficult for individuals to break free from its grip. However, by recognizing these patterns of behavior and working to overcome them, people can create more harmonious communities and improve their overall well-being.">

    <edge source="The &quot;Village Virus&quot; is a term used by the speaker to describe a state of mind that affects ambitious people who remain in small towns for extended periods. It is described as a germ that infects individuals, making them resistant to change and new challenges, even when they have had opportunities to experience wider worldviews. The speaker suggests that this virus makes it difficult for infected individuals to leave their comfort zones and compete with &quot;younger men&quot; in more dynamic environments. This resistance to change can ultimately lead to stagnation and a lack of progress in small towns." target="1. Skepticism towards scientific farming: The character expresses skepticism about scientific farming, suggesting that there is &quot;nothing to it&quot; and implying that traditional farming methods are sufficient. They also mention a county agent who comes once every two weeks, which might be seen as enough support for farmers.&#10;&#10;2. Preference for lectures in churches: Instead of supporting the idea of holding lectures in a lecture hall, the character believes that listening to sermons in churches is a better alternative. This reflects their attachment to traditional ways and their preference for religious teachings over &quot;heathen learning.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Opposition to changing architecture style: The character strongly opposes changing the town's architecture to Colonial style, claiming that it would not resemble the place they love. They cherish the current appearance of the town with its trees, lawns, and comfy houses. This opposition to change showcases their comfort with the status quo and resistance to new ideas, which aligns with the concept of the &quot;Village Virus.&quot;">

Morality: The traditional viewpoint expressed in this text emphasizes a strict adherence to what is considered &quot;the true Word of God&quot; and conventional moral values. It criticizes new-fangled science or higher criticism that challenges established beliefs. There is a strong emphasis on the concept of hell as a means to enforce morality. The speaker believes that socialists should be hanged, and anyone who makes more than ten thousand a year or less than eight hundred is wicked.&#10;2. Wealth: Wealth is seen from a black-and-white perspective in this traditional viewpoint. Those with wealth beyond a certain threshold are considered wicked, while those with insufficient wealth are also viewed negatively. The text suggests that people should be content with their earnings and not strive for more than what is deemed appropriate.&#10;3. Role of Religion in Society: Religion plays a significant role in the traditional viewpoint presented in this text. The speaker asserts that the Republican Party, or the Grand Old Party of Blaine and McKinley, is the agent of the Lord and of the Baptist Church in temporal affairs. This implies that religion should have a strong influence on political and social matters, and those who do not adhere to these religious beliefs are seen as threats to society's moral fabric.">

However, instead of living harmoniously, people engage in activities that create discord, such as wars, politics, and racism.&#10;&#10;In Gopher Prairie specifically, people artificially make themselves unhappy by focusing on petty differences and engaging in destructive competition. For example, the text mentions &quot;commercial hatred&quot; where grocers feel contempt for those who don't do business with them. This kind of behavior creates unnecessary divisions and tension within the community, contributing to an overall sense of unhappiness and discontent.&#10;&#10;People engage in these actions because they have become accustomed to seeking pleasure from conflict and competition, even if it comes at a great cost.

Those with wealth beyond a certain threshold are considered wicked, while those with insufficient wealth are also viewed negatively. The text suggests that people should be content with their earnings and not strive for more than what is deemed appropriate.&#10;3. Role of Religion in Society: Religion plays a significant role in the traditional viewpoint presented in this text. The speaker asserts that the Republican Party, or the Grand Old Party of Blaine and McKinley, is the agent of the Lord and of the Baptist Church in temporal affairs. This implies that religion should have a strong influence on political and social matters, and those who do not adhere to these religious beliefs are seen as threats to society's moral fabric.">

Morality: The traditional viewpoint expressed in this text emphasizes a strict adherence to what is considered &quot;the true Word of God&quot; and conventional moral values. It criticizes new-fangled science or higher criticism that challenges established beliefs. There is a strong emphasis on the concept of hell as a means to enforce morality. The speaker believes that socialists should be hanged, and anyone who makes more than ten thousand a year or less than eight hundred is wicked.&#10;2. Wealth: Wealth is seen from a black-and-white perspective in this traditional viewpoint. Those with wealth beyond a certain threshold are considered wicked, while those with insufficient wealth are also viewed negatively. The text suggests that people should be content with their earnings and not strive for more than what is deemed appropriate.&#10;3. Role of Religion in Society: Religion plays a significant role in the traditional viewpoint presented in this text. The speaker asserts that the Republican Party, or the Grand Old Party of Blaine and McKinley, is the agent of the Lord and of the Baptist Church in temporal affairs. This implies that religion should have a strong influence on political and social matters, and those who do not adhere to these religious beliefs are seen as threats to society's moral fabric.">

    <edge source="1. Morality: The traditional viewpoint expressed in this text emphasizes a strict adherence to what is considered &quot;the true Word of God&quot; and conventional moral values. It criticizes new-fangled science or higher criticism that challenges established beliefs. There is a strong emphasis on the concept of hell as a means to enforce morality. The speaker believes that socialists should be hanged, and anyone who makes more than ten thousand a year or less than eight hundred is wicked.&#10;2. Wealth: Wealth is seen from a black-and-white perspective in this traditional viewpoint. Those with wealth beyond a certain threshold are considered wicked, while those with insufficient wealth are also viewed negatively. The text suggests that people should be content with their earnings and not strive for more than what is deemed appropriate.&#10;3. Role of Religion in Society: Religion plays a significant role in the traditional viewpoint presented in this text. The speaker asserts that the Republican Party, or the Grand Old Party of Blaine and McKinley, is the agent of the Lord and of the Baptist Church in temporal affairs. This implies that religion should have a strong influence on political and social matters, and those who do not adhere to these religious beliefs are seen as threats to society's moral fabric." target="What do you think of my plans, Mrs.&#10;Warren?&quot; she concluded.&#10;&#10;Speaking judiciously, as one related to the church by marriage, Mrs.&#10;Warren gave verdict:&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm sure we're all heartily in accord with Mrs. Kennicott in feeling&#10;that wherever genuine poverty is encountered, it is not only noblesse&#10;oblige but a joy to fulfil our duty to the less fortunate ones.

And isn't it&#10;better so? I should hate to think of a world in which we were deprived&#10;of all the pleasure of giving. Besides, if these shiftless folks realize&#10;they're getting charity, and not something to which they have a right,&#10;they're so much more grateful.&quot;&#10;&#10;">

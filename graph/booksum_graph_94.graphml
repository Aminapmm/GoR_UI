    <node id="In this passage, the group starts with serious topics but then shifts to more light-hearted and humorous conversation. Sam Clark jokes about Harry Haydock's &quot;wild-eyed sale of summer caps,&quot; implying that he is either stealing or overcharging for them. Sam then shares a story about someone named Will, who didn't put chains on his vehicle during rainy weather, which is a common source of amusement among the group.&#10;&#10;Carol briefly participates in the banter but eventually grows tired and leaves to join the dancers. The group appears to be having fun, with men giggling amiably as they pass around a whisky bottle and laughing at Juanita Haydock taking a sip.&#10;&#10;The conversation then shifts to the idea of forming a dramatic club and putting on a play, which is initially met with enthusiasm from the group. However, Carol soon realizes that the group's idea of &quot;hard work&quot; may not align with her own vision of creating something beautiful in the theater." />

Sam Clark was particularly apt at them. &quot;What's&#10;this wild-eyed sale of summer caps you think you're trying to pull&#10;off?&quot; he clamored at Harry Haydock. &quot;Did you steal 'em, or are you just&#10;overcharging us, as usual? . . . Oh say, speaking about caps, d'I ever&#10;tell you the good one I've got on Will? The doc thinks he's a pretty&#10;good driver, fact, he thinks he's almost got human intelligence, but one&#10;time he had his machine out in the rain, and the poor fish, he hadn't&#10;put on chains, and thinks I----&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol had heard the story rather often. She fled back to the dancers,&#10;and at Dave Dyer's masterstroke of dropping an icicle down Mrs.&#10;McGanum's back she applauded hysterically.&#10;&#10;They sat on the floor, devouring the food.

The men giggled amiably as&#10;they passed the whisky bottle, and laughed, &quot;There's a real sport!&quot; when&#10;Juanita Haydock took a sip. Carol tried to follow; she believed that she&#10;desired to be drunk and riotous; but the whisky choked her and as she&#10;saw Kennicott frown she handed the bottle on repentantly. Somewhat too&#10;late she remembered that she had given up domesticity and repentance.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let's play charades!&quot; said Raymie Wutherspoon.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, do let us,&quot; said Ella Stowbody.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the caper,&quot; sanctioned Harry Haydock.&#10;&#10;They interpreted the word &quot;making&quot; as May and King. The crown was a red&#10;flannel mitten cocked on Sam Clark's broad pink bald head. They forgot&#10;they were respectable. They made-believe.

Carol had lost her dream. Harry Haydock lifted her by the&#10;waist and swung her. She laughed. The gravity of the people who stood&#10;apart and talked made her the more impatient for frolic.&#10;&#10;Kennicott, Sam Clark, Jackson Elder, young Dr. McGanum, and James&#10;Madison Howland, teetering on their toes near the stove, conversed&#10;with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist. In details the men were&#10;unlike, yet they said the same things in the same hearty monotonous&#10;voices.

    <node id="The plot of &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; revolves around a farm-lassie who successfully clears her brother of a forgery charge. She becomes the secretary to a New York millionaire and social counselor to his wife, eventually marrying the millionaire's son after delivering a well-conceived speech on the discomfort of having money. The play features an humorous office-boy and is meant to be entertaining with humor and pep, as per Juanita Haydock's theory that American playwrights surpass European ones in these aspects.&#10;&#10;Carol disliked &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; more than she had expected because she wanted the play to have some class and believed it lacked any message or artistic value. She was also disappointed as the play did not provide any meaningful commentary on society, unlike what she hoped for with her earlier suggestion of &quot;His Mother's Heart.&quot; Additionally, Carol found the play's storyline predictable and unoriginal, which further added to her disappointment." />

She let Juanita have it. Juanita kissed her and in the exuberant&#10;manner of a new star presented to the executive committee her theory,&#10;&quot;What we want in a play is humor and pep. There's where American&#10;playwrights put it all over these darn old European glooms.&quot;&#10;&#10;As selected by Carol and confirmed by the committee, the persons of the&#10;play were:&#10;&#10;     John Grimm, a millionaire .  .   .  .

I laughed out loud, reading it.&#10;It's called 'His Mother's Heart,' and it's about a young man in college&#10;who gets in with a lot of free-thinkers and boozers and everything, but&#10;in the end his mother's influence----&quot;&#10;&#10;Juanita Haydock broke in with a derisive, &quot;Oh rats, Raymie! Can the&#10;mother's influence! I say let's give something with some class to it.&#10;I bet we could get the rights to 'The Girl from Kankakee,' and that's a&#10;real show.

The&#10;rooms in the op'ra house sets had separate wing-pieces for sides, which&#10;simplified dramaturgy, as the villain could always get out of the hero's&#10;way by walking out through the wall.&#10;&#10;The inhabitants of the Humble Home were supposed to be amiable and&#10;intelligent.

    <node id="The night of the play is a thrilling experience for the amateur actors. There is a palpable sense of excitement and nervousness backstage as they prepare for their performance. They are dressed in costumes and wearing makeup applied by Del Snafflin, a professional barber who has some experience in theater. He is tasked with making them up for their roles, and he does so with a mix of scorn for amateurs and pride in his work. The actors seem to be both frightened and fascinated by the process, examining Del's makeup box, sniffing the scent of grease-paint, peeping through the hole in the curtain to watch the audience, and reading pencil inscriptions on the walls from previous troupers. Overall, there is a sense of community and shared experience among the actors, who are all in this together as they put on their play." />

If you don't, reckon nobody ever will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;V&#10;&#10;&#10;It was the great night; it was the night of the play. The two&#10;dressing-rooms were swirling with actors, panting, twitchy pale. Del&#10;Snafflin the barber, who was as much a professional as Ella, having once&#10;gone on in a mob scene at a stock-company performance in Minneapolis,&#10;was making them up, and showing his scorn for amateurs with, &quot;Stand&#10;still!

They examined Del's makeup box, they&#10;sniffed the scent of grease-paint, every minute they ran out to peep&#10;through the hole in the curtain, they came back to inspect their wigs&#10;and costumes, they read on the whitewashed walls of the dressing-rooms&#10;the pencil inscriptions: &quot;The Flora Flanders Comedy Company,&quot; and &quot;This&#10;is a bum theater,&quot; and felt that they were companions of these vanished&#10;troupers.&#10;&#10;Carol, smart in maid's uniform, coaxed the temporary stage-hands to&#10;finish setting the first act, wailed at Kennicott, the electrician, &quot;Now&#10;for heaven's sake remember the change in cue for the ambers in Act Two,&quot;&#10;slipped out to ask Dave Dyer, the ticket-taker, if he could get some&#10;more chairs, warned the frightened Myrtle Cass to be sure to upset the&#10;waste-basket when John Grimm called, &quot;Here you, Reddy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Del Snafflin's orchestra of piano, violin, and cornet began to tune up&#10;and every one behind the magic line of" />

There were so&#10;many people out there, staring so hard----&#10;&#10;In the second row she saw Miles Bjornstam, not with Bea but alone.&#10;He really wanted to see the play! It was a good omen. Who could tell?&#10;Perhaps this evening would convert Gopher Prairie to conscious beauty.&#10;&#10;She darted into the women's dressing-room, roused Maud Dyer from her&#10;fainting panic, pushed her to the wings, and ordered the curtain up.&#10;&#10;It rose doubtfully, it staggered and trembled, but it did get up without&#10;catching--this time. Then she realized that Kennicott had forgotten to&#10;turn off the houselights. Some one out front was giggling.&#10;&#10;She galloped round to the left wing, herself pulled the switch, looked&#10;so ferociously at Kennicott that he quaked, and fled back.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dyer was creeping out on the" />
    <node id=" Brussels cafe and going afterward&#10;to a tiny gay theater under a cathedral wall.&#10;&#10;The advertisement in the Minneapolis paper leaped from the page to her&#10;eyes:&#10;&#10;     The Cosmos School of Music, Oratory, and&#10;     Dramatic Art announces a program of four&#10;     one-act plays by Schnitzler, Shaw, Yeats,&#10;     and Lord Dunsany.&#10;&#10;She had to be there! She begged Kennicott to &quot;run down to the Cities&quot;&#10;with her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I don't know. Be fun to take in a show, but why the deuce do you&#10;want to see those darn foreign plays, given by a lot of amateurs? Why&#10;don't you wait for a regular play, later on? There's going to be some&#10;corkers coming: 'Lottie of Two-Gun Rancho,' and 'Cops and Crooks'--real&#10;Broadway stuff, with the New York casts. What's this junk you want&#10;to see? Hm. 'How He Lied to Her Husband.' That doesn't listen so bad.&#10;Sounds racy. And, uh," />
    <node id="The difference between the plays that interest Carol and the ones Kennicott prefers is primarily in their content and themes. Carol is interested in seeing a program of one-act plays by Schnitzler, Shaw, Yeats, and Lord Dunsany because they offer something different and more intellectual than the popular shows Kennicott prefers, such as 'Lottie of Two-Gun Rancho' or 'Cops and Crooks.' These plays are likely to be more serious, thought-provoking, and perhaps even controversial, which appeals to Carol's desire for cultural enrichment.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Kennicott prefers more mainstream and entertaining shows that he considers &quot;real Broadway stuff&quot; with professional casts from New York. He is skeptical about the quality of the amateur productions of the one-act plays and is easily bored if they do not meet his expectations. He also seems to prefer plays with racy or sensational themes, as indicated by his interest in 'How He Lied to Her Husband.'&#10;&#10;Carol wants to go to Brussels to see this program of one-act plays because she recognizes the opportunity to experience something new and different. The advertisement for the Cosmos School of Music, Oratory, and Dramatic Art's production in Minneapolis piques her interest, and despite Kennicott's lack of enthusiasm, she remains determined to attend. This desire to see the plays is part of Carol's broader aspiration for cultural growth and intellectual stimulation, which is often frustrated by the provincialism of Gopher Prairie." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Strikes me it's going to be punk. If the first play isn't good, let's&#10;beat it,&quot; said Kennicott hopefully.&#10;&#10;&quot;All right,&quot; she yawned. With hazy eyes she tried to read the lists of&#10;characters, which were hidden among lifeless advertisements of pianos,&#10;music-dealers, restaurants, candy.&#10;&#10;She regarded the Schnitzler play with no vast interest. The actors&#10;moved and spoke stiffly. Just as its cynicism was beginning to rouse her&#10;village-dulled frivolity, it was over.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't think a whale of a lot of that. How about taking a sneak?&quot;&#10;petitioned Kennicott.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, let's try the next one, 'How He Lied to Her Husband.'&quot;&#10;&#10;The Shaw conceit amused her, and perplexed Kennicott:&#10;&#10;&quot;Strikes me it's darn fresh. Thought it would be racy. Don't know as I&#10;think much of a play where a husband actually claims he wants a fellow&#10;to make love to his wife. No husband ever did that!

Two young men in brown robes&#10;like furniture-covers were gesturing vacuously and droning cryptic&#10;sentences full of repetitions.&#10;&#10;It was Carol's first hearing of Dunsany. She sympathized with the&#10;restless Kennicott as he felt in his pocket for a cigar and unhappily&#10;put it back.&#10;&#10;Without understanding when or how, without a tangible change in the&#10;stilted intoning of the stage-puppets, she was conscious of another time&#10;and place.&#10;&#10;Stately and aloof among vainglorious tiring-maids, a queen in robes&#10;that murmured on the marble floor, she trod the gallery of a crumbling&#10;palace.

After&#10;breakfast Carol bustled to a hair-dresser's, bought gloves and a blouse,&#10;and importantly met Kennicott in front of an optician's, in accordance&#10;with plans laid down, revised, and verified. They admired the diamonds&#10;and furs and frosty silverware and mahogany chairs and polished morocco&#10;sewing-boxes in shop-windows, and were abashed by the throngs in the&#10;department-stores, and were bullied by a clerk into buying too many&#10;shirts for Kennicott, and gaped at the &quot;clever novelty perfumes--just&#10;in from New York.&quot; Carol got three books on the theater, and spent&#10;an exultant hour in warning herself that she could not afford this&#10;rajah-silk frock, in thinking how envious it would make Juanita Haydock,&#10;in closing her eyes, and buying it. Kennicott went from shop to shop,&#10;earnestly hunting down a felt-covered device to keep the windshield of&#10;his" />

The hidden&#10;orchestra was lively. She saw a man who looked like a European diplomat,&#10;in a loose top-coat and a Homburg hat. A woman with a broadtail coat,&#10;a heavy lace veil, pearl earrings, and a close black hat entered the&#10;restaurant. &quot;Heavens! That's the first really smart woman I've seen in a&#10;year!&quot; Carol exulted. She felt metropolitan.&#10;&#10;But as she followed Kennicott to the elevator the coat-check girl, a&#10;confident young woman, with cheeks powdered like lime, and a blouse&#10;low and thin and furiously crimson, inspected her, and under that&#10;supercilious glance Carol was shy again. She unconsciously waited&#10;for the bellboy to precede her into the elevator. When he snorted &quot;Go&#10;ahead!&quot; she was mortified. He" />
    <node id="opher Prairie wouldn't use their legs and explore, the way we do!&quot;&#10;&#10;They had two meals with Carol's sister, and were bored, and felt that&#10;intimacy which beatifies married people when they suddenly admit that&#10;they equally dislike a relative of either of them.&#10;&#10;So it was with affection but also with weariness that they approached&#10;the evening on which Carol was to see the plays at the dramatic school.&#10;Kennicott suggested not going. &quot;So darn tired from all this walking;&#10;don't know but what we better turn in early and get rested up.&quot; It was&#10;only from duty that Carol dragged him and herself out of the warm&#10;hotel, into a stinking trolley, up the brownstone steps of the converted&#10;residence which lugubriously housed the dramatic school.&#10;&#10;&#10;V&#10;&#10;&#10;They were in a long whitewashed hall with a clumsy draw-curtain across&#10;the front. The folding chairs were filled with people who looked washed&#10;and ironed: parents of the pupils, girl students, dutiful teachers.&#10;&#10;&quot;Strikes me it's going to be punk. If the first play isn't good, let's&#10;beat it,&quot; said Kennicott hopefully" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is clear that the group aims to create something artistic in their literary venture. At first, Carol suggests giving a classic play or even a Greek drama, but these ideas are dismissed. Vida Sherwin then introduces &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law,&quot; a farce that Carol dislikes because she believes it lacks any message or artistic value.&#10;&#10;Therefore, given their goal to create something artistic, the group should consider performing a play that has depth, meaning, and artistic merit. Carol's initial suggestion of Shaw's &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; could be a good compromise as it is not as difficult as a Dunsany play but still offers more substance than &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law.&quot; Alternatively, they could explore other plays by contemporary playwrights known for their artistic merit and social commentary." />

Her&#10;jungle romance had faded, but she retained a religious fervor, a surge&#10;of half-formed thought about the creation of beauty by suggestion.&#10;&#10;A Dunsany play would be too difficult for the Gopher Prairie&#10;association. She would let them compromise on Shaw--on &quot;Androcles and&#10;the Lion,&quot; which had just been published.&#10;&#10;The committee was composed of Carol, Vida Sherwin, Guy Pollock, Raymie&#10;Wutherspoon, and Juanita Haydock. They were exalted by the picture of&#10;themselves as being simultaneously business-like and artistic. They&#10;were entertained by Vida in the parlor of Mrs. Elisha Gur" />
    <node id="Carol Kennicott found the strength to endure staying in Gopher Prairie after her disappointing experience with &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; through two main factors: first, the encouragement and support of Miles Bjornstam and the fact that every seat for the play had been sold, which indicated some level of interest and appreciation for cultural events in the town. Second, Carol's determination to make a difference and bring about change in Gopher Prairie gave her the motivation to stay and continue her efforts. She recognized the value of perseverance and wanted to prove that she could be an authentic part of the town by promoting cultural growth and intellectual stimulation." />
    <node id=" right. I'm a fool. Holiness of the&#10;drama! Bernard Shaw! The only trouble with 'The Girl from Kankakee' is&#10;that it's too subtle for Gopher Prairie!&quot;&#10;&#10;She sought faith in spacious banal phrases, taken from books: &quot;the&#10;instinctive nobility of simple souls,&quot; &quot;need only the opportunity, to&#10;appreciate fine things,&quot; and &quot;sturdy exponents of democracy.&quot; But these&#10;optimisms did not sound so loud as the laughter of the audience at the&#10;funny-man's line, &quot;Yes, by heckelum, I'm a smart fella.&quot; She wanted to&#10;give up the play, the dramatic association, the town. As she came out&#10;of the tent and walked with Kennicott down the dusty spring street, she&#10;peered at this straggling wooden village and felt that she could not&#10;possibly stay here through all of tomorrow.&#10;&#10;It was Miles Bjornstam who gave her strength--he and the fact that every&#10;seat for &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; had been sold.&#10;&#10;Bjornstam was &quot;keeping company&quot; with Bea.

How bravely and generously it did its work, forwarding the&#10;bread of the world, feeding and healing the farmers!&#10;&#10;Then, on the corner below her husband's office, she heard a farmer&#10;holding forth:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sure.

They start by discussing their journey and comparing it to driving an automobile. The conversation then shifts to tires, specifically the Sphinx tire and the Roadeater Cord. It appears that they value the Roadeater Cord more for its quality and durability.&#10;&#10;Additionally, they discuss Pete Garsheim's land and payments, suggesting that they are familiar with his situation and find it admirable. They describe his farm as &quot;a dandy&quot; and &quot;a good place,&quot; indicating their positive view of it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the group seems to have a shared interest in practical matters such as tires and farming, while also valuing humor and light-hearted banter in their conversations." />

I'm sure the applause shows the audience think it's just&#10;dandy!&quot;&#10;&#10;Then Carol knew how completely she had failed.&#10;&#10;As the audience seeped out she heard B. J.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is clear that Carol is deeply disappointed with the quality of the play and the acting. She had hoped for something artistic and meaningful, but instead, she found the play to be predictable, unoriginal, and lacking in any message or artistic value. This disappointment is evident when she observes the audience's reaction to the play and hears B.J. Gougerling, a banker, express his preference for movies over plays.&#10;&#10;Carol also notes how some of the actors, such as Myrtle Cass, seem more interested in the applause of their relatives than in delivering a good performance. She is further disheartened when Miles Bjornstam leaves during the intermission and does not return, indicating his dissatisfaction with the play.&#10;&#10;Despite her disappointment, Carol remains committed to her vision of creating something artistic and meaningful. She sees this production as a starting point and uses it as an opportunity to rally the company around her vision, asking them to commit to working on another play in September.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's reaction to the poorly acted play is one of disappointment and determination. While she is clearly disheartened by the quality of the production, she remains committed to her goal of creating something artistic and meaningful, using this experience as a catalyst for future endeavors." />

They&#10;sat at a teak and marble table eating Eggs Fooyung, and listened to a&#10;brassy automatic piano, and were altogether cosmopolitan.&#10;&#10;On the street they met people from home--the McGanums.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott found Maire Bruin's portrayal of the girl in Yeats' 'Land of Heart's Desire' captivating due to several factors. Firstly, Maire Bruin was an excellent actress who embodied the character's grace and innocence, being slim as Carol and larger-eyed, with a voice that resembled a morning bell. These qualities helped create a strong connection between Maire Bruin's portrayal and Carol, making her feel as though she were seeing herself in the character.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the setting of the play and the atmosphere created by the actress allowed Carol to be transported from her sleepy small-town life with her husband to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where she could immerse herself in the green dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches. This setting enabled her to escape the mundane realities of her daily life and indulge in the beauty and allure of the ancient gods and twilight women presented in the play.&#10;&#10;Overall, Maire Bruin's captivating performance, combined with the dreamlike atmosphere of 'Land of Heart's Desire,' allowed Carol to momentarily disconnect from her provincial surroundings and enter a world filled with cultural richness and intellectual stimulation that she yearns for in her life." />

In her, Carol lived, and on her lifting voice was&#10;transported from this sleepy small-town husband and all the rows of&#10;polite parents to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where in a green&#10;dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches, she bent over a&#10;chronicle of twilight women and the ancient gods.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--gosh--nice kid played that girl--good-looker,&quot; said Kennicott." />
    <node id="The exhilarating bob-sled ride was a memorable experience for Carol and the other revelers.

When they got tired, they climbed back on the runners for a lift. The moon-tipped flakes kicked up by the horses settled over the revelers and dripped down their necks, but they laughed and yelped, beating their leather mittens against their chests. The harness rattled, and the sleigh-bells were frantic as Jack Elder's setter sprang beside the horses, barking. For a time, Carol raced with them, feeling that she could run on all night and leap twenty feet at a stride due to the cold air's fictive power. However, the excess of energy tired her, and she was glad to snuggle under the comforters which covered the hay in the sled-box, finding enchanted quietude amidst the babel. Along the road, the shadows from oak-branches were inked on the snow like bars of music. The sled came out on the surface of Lake Minniemashie, and the moonlight was overwhelming, turning the woods ashore into crystals of fire.

The interior walls of unpainted&#10;boards, which had been grateful in August, were forbidding in the chill.&#10;In fur coats and mufflers tied over caps they were a strange company,&#10;bears and walruses talking.

These worries were a source of enjoyment for her.

When Kennicott rejoiced,&#10;&quot;We'll have a great time this summer; move down to the lake early and&#10;wear old clothes and act natural,&quot; she smiled, but her smile creaked.&#10;&#10;In the prairie heat she trudged along unchanging ways, talked about&#10;nothing to tepid people, and reflected that she might never escape from&#10;them.&#10;&#10;She was startled to find that she was using the word &quot;escape.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then, for three years which passed like one curt paragraph, she ceased&#10;to find anything interesting save the Bjornstams and her baby.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Carol had noted Mrs.&#10;Dillon dragging past the house during a bridge of the Jolly Seventeen,&#10;looking in with pathetic lips at the splendor of the accepted. She&#10;impulsively invited the Dillons to the dramatic association meeting, and&#10;when Kennicott was brusque to them she was unusually cordial, and felt&#10;virtuous.&#10;&#10;That self-approval balanced her disappointment at the smallness of the&#10;meeting, and her embarrassment during Raymie Wutherspoon's repetitions&#10;of &quot;The stage needs uplifting,&quot; and &quot;I believe that there are great&#10;lessons in some plays.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ella Stowbody, who was a professional, having studied elocution in&#10;Milwaukee," />

When Carol says that there might be more fun in producing a perfect play rather than just having a circus, she means that the process of working hard to create something beautiful and artistic can provide a deeper sense of fulfillment and enjoyment than simply aiming for light-hearted entertainment or amusement. She believes that the challenge of creating something excellent, the satisfaction of improving oneself and one's craft, and the joy of sharing a meaningful creation with others can be more rewarding and memorable than merely putting on a show for easy laughs or thrills.&#10;2. Carol believes that creating a beautiful thing can bring pride, satisfaction, and even holiness because she values art and aesthetics as essential components of human experience and growth. She sees the process of making something beautiful as a way to connect with oneself, others, and the world in a deeper and more meaningful way. By striving for perfection, expressing one's ideas and emotions through artistic mediums, and sharing this creation with an audience, one can feel a sense of accomplishment, purpose, and transcendence that goes beyond mere material or superficial pleasures. In other words, creating something beautiful can be a spiritual experience that enriches one's life and the lives of others, fostering a sense of community, empathy, and appreciation for the human condition." />

They compare their travel experience to driving an automobile and discuss the quality and durability of different types of tires, particularly favoring the Roadeater Cord over the Sphinx tire. The group also shares a positive view of Pete Garsheim's land, describing it as &quot;a dandy farm&quot; and &quot;a good place.&quot;&#10;&#10;When discussing tires, they express their preference for the Roadeater Cord due to its superior quality and durability, particularly comparing it favorably to the Sphinx tire. This conversation demonstrates their shared interest in practical matters and common experiences.&#10;&#10;Regarding Pete Garsheim's land, the group admires his ability to pay for it and appreciates the value of his farm, highlighting its positive aspects through phrases like &quot;a dandy farm&quot; and &quot;a good place.&quot; This conversation suggests that they are familiar with Pete's situation and find it commendable.&#10;&#10;In summary, the conversation between this group revolves around their shared interests in practical matters such as tires and farming. They also value humor and light-hearted banter, while expressing admiration for Pete Garsheim's ability to maintain his land." />
    <node id="As Mrs. Kennicott enters the hotel lobby, she feels self-conscious and out of place because she is not accustomed to such environments. She wants people to believe that she and her husband are used to luxury, but when she realizes that no one is paying attention to them, she feels foolish and ashamed of her irritation. She tries to assert her sophistication by criticizing the lobby's floridness while simultaneously admiring it. These feelings reflect her longing for the comfort and familiarity of her hometown, Gopher Prairie, and highlight her struggle with self-doubt and social anxiety." />
    <node id="Based on the passage, the McGanums explored Minneapolis with the Kennicotts during their visit. They were shown through the largest flour-mills in the world, where Kennicott expressed his interest in the industrial processes. The group also looked at the city's landmarks, such as Loring Park, the Parade, St. Mark's and the Procathedral, and Kenwood Hill. They drove around the chain of garden-circled lakes and viewed the houses of the millers, lumbermen, and real estate peers, indicating that they were interested in seeing the homes of the city's influential figures.&#10;&#10;The McGanums and Kennicotts dined extravagantly at their hotel and later sneaked around the corner to economize at a Childs' Restaurant. They also went to a Chinese restaurant frequented by clerks and their sweethearts on pay-days, demonstrating their desire to experience the city's cultural diversity.&#10;&#10;Overall, the McGanums seemed to enjoy their explorations in Minneapolis, taking in the sights and sounds of the city with enthusiasm.

The McGanums said good-by as though&#10;they were going to Tibet instead of to the station to catch No. 7 north.&#10;&#10;They explored Minneapolis. Kennicott was conversational and technical&#10;regarding gluten and cockle-cylinders and No. I Hard, when they were&#10;shown through the gray stone hulks and new cement elevators of the&#10;largest flour-mills in the world.

She felt&#10;rustic in this once familiar city, after a year and a half of&#10;Gopher Prairie. She was certain that Kennicott was taking the wrong&#10;trolley-car. By dusk, the liquor warehouses, Hebraic clothing-shops,&#10;and lodging-houses on lower Hennepin Avenue were smoky, hideous,&#10;ill-tempered. She was battered by the noise and shuttling of the&#10;rush-hour traffic. When a clerk in an overcoat too closely fitted at the&#10;waist stared at her, she moved nearer to Kennicott's arm. The clerk was&#10;flippant and urban. He was a superior person, used to this tumult. Was&#10;he laughing at her" />
    <node id="The group of individuals were engaged in a light-hearted and humorous conversation, discussing various topics such as their journey, tires, farming, and the idea of forming a dramatic club. To continue having fun, Carol suggested they create beauty in the theater by putting on a play, but emphasized the importance of doing it authentically with hard work, high artistic standards, and punctuality at rehearsals. She proposed forming the Gopher Prairie Dramatic Association to make this happen. Carol was excited about this plan because she saw it as an opportunity to be an authentic part of the town, connect with people, and create something beautiful together." />
    <node id="As a result of Sam Clark boasting about the dramatic association to his schoolmate, Percy Bresnahan, they received a check for a hundred dollars. With Sam adding twenty-five dollars, they had a starting fund for their play. They rented the second floor of the city hall and cleared out the bunting, ballot-boxes, handbills, and legless chairs to transform the space into a theater. The group was initially enthusiastic about putting on a play, but Carol soon realized that their idea of 'hard work' may not align with her vision of creating something beautiful in the theater. Despite some initial success, the group's lack of dedication and discipline became apparent during rehearsals, causing Carol to feel defeated by Main Street's conventionality and lack of artistic ambition. The local newspaper, the Gopher Prairie Dauntless, praised their performance, but Carol was not encouraged, as she saw through the superficial positivity and recognized her own defeat in her attempts to bring authentic theater to the town." />

She told herself that, after all, a great deal&#10;could be done with direction and settings.&#10;&#10;Sam Clark had boastfully written about the dramatic association to his&#10;schoolmate, Percy Bresnahan, president of the Velvet Motor Company&#10;of Boston.

All through&#10;the spring the association thrilled to its own talent in that dismal&#10;room. They cleared out the bunting, ballot-boxes, handbills, legless&#10;chairs" />

    <node id="Carol Reddy had to rush around and fix things herself during the preparation for the play's performance because of a lack of organization and assistance from others. The text mentions that she is urging temporary stagehands to finish setting up the first act, reminding Kennicott about the lighting cues, asking Dave Dyer for more chairs, and warning Myrtle Cass about her role. Furthermore, she steps in to turn off the houselights herself when they are left on during the orchestra's tuning. This demonstrates Carol's proactive nature and her willingness to take charge of situations to ensure things run smoothly, even if it means doing everything herself." />

    <node id="Carol Kennicott played a significant role in setting up the community theater in Gopher Prairie. She proposed the idea of forming the Gopher Prairie Dramatic Association and emphasized the importance of hard work, high artistic standards, and punctuality at rehearsals. Carol's friends, including Sam Clark and Percy Bresnahan, helped by providing financial support and renting the second floor of the city hall to transform it into a theater.&#10;&#10;However, Carol soon realized that their idea of 'hard work' may not align with her vision of creating something beautiful in the theater. The local newspaper, the Gopher Prairie Dauntless, praised their performance, but Carol saw through the superficial positivity and recognized her own defeat in her attempts to bring authentic theater to the town.&#10;&#10;Despite the initial success and support from some members of the community, the group's lack of dedication and discipline became apparent during rehearsals. The townspeople's reaction was mixed, with some praising their efforts, but Carol saw through the superficial positivity and recognized her own defeat in her attempts to bring authentic theater to the town.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Carol and her friends played a significant role in setting up the community theater, their vision of high artistic standards and hard work was not fully realized due to the lack of dedication and discipline from some members of the group. The townspeople's reaction was mixed, with some praising their efforts but ultimately failing to appreciate the authenticity that Carol aimed to bring to the theater in Gopher Prairie." />
    <node id="The passage doesn't explicitly state the reason behind Kennicott's decision to go to the Cities. However, it mentions that he casually let people know about his plan, which suggests that it might not have been a well-thought-out or solidified decision at first. His wife, Carol, assumes that he is going to see some shows. The narrative also reveals that Kennicott and Carol met the McGanums, who are also in the city, which could have influenced his decision. Ultimately, the exact reason for his decision remains unclear in the text. The author seems more focused on describing the couple's experiences and Carol's emotions during their trip rather than providing a detailed rationale behind Kennicott's decision." />
    <node id="1. The cast's behavior towards rehearsals negatively affects Carol's efforts to create something artistic because their lack of dedication, discipline, and low artistic standards clash with her vision for the theater. She aims to produce high-quality, meaningful performances that go beyond light entertainment, but many of the actors prioritize easy laughs and applause from their relatives over delivering a good performance. This disregard for artistic values and neglect of hard work can be frustrating and demoralizing for Carol as she sees her efforts being undermined by the very people who should be helping to bring her vision to life.&#10;2. In terms of punctuality, the cast's behavior poses challenges because their tardiness or absence from rehearsals disrupts the schedule and makes it difficult to progress with staging the play. Carol emphasizes the importance of being on time and prepared for rehearsals, but her instructions often fall on deaf ears. Their lack of commitment further exacerbates this issue as unreliable actors may not show up at all, leaving important roles unfilled or causing delays in the rehearsal process. These challenges hinder Carol's ability to create a cohesive and polished performance, as it becomes difficult to maintain continuity when cast members are frequently absent or late." />
    <node id="Based on Carol's interest in the one-act plays by Schnitzler, Shaw, Yeats, and Lord Dunsany, it can be inferred that she is planning to propose a similar program of plays to the play-reading committee for their consideration. She chooses these types of plays because they offer something different and more intellectual than the popular shows that are commonly preferred by the people of Gopher Prairie, like 'Lottie of Two-Gun Rancho' or 'Cops and Crooks.' These plays align with Carol's desire for cultural enrichment and her aspiration to bring about change in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide information on a specific play that Carol intends to propose, but based on her interest in the one-act plays she saw in Minneapolis, it is clear that she wants to introduce similar thought-provoking and perhaps controversial works to her community." />
    <node id="The passage describes a sudden shift in Carol's perception, where she momentarily imagines herself in the setting of a dramatic play. This is due to her exposure to &quot;Dunsany,&quot; a reference to the Irish playwright Lord Dunsany, who was known for his fantastical and imaginative plays.&#10;&#10;Carol has just attended a performance with her husband, where she found the abstract and cryptic language of the play difficult to understand. However, as she sits in the theater, she suddenly feels as if she has been transported into the world of the play itself. She imagines herself as a Syrian queen in a crumbling palace, surrounded by armed guards and exotic animals.&#10;&#10;This vivid daydream is triggered by Carol's desire to escape the mundane realities of her life and experience new and exciting things. The passage highlights Carol's longing for adventure and her fascination with the arts, as well as her tendency to get lost in her own imagination. However, she quickly snaps out of this reverie when she realizes that she is still sitting in a whitewashed hall, surrounded by ordinary people.&#10;&#10;In summary, the passage describes a brief moment of imaginative escapism on Carol's part, where she briefly mistakes her surroundings for those of a dramatic play. This is a result of her exposure to highbrow drama and her desire to experience new and exciting things." />

In the courtyard, elephants trumpeted, and swart men with beards&#10;dyed crimson stood with blood-stained hands folded upon their hilts,&#10;guarding the caravan from El Sharnak, the camels with Tyrian stuffs&#10;of topaz and cinnabar. Beyond the turrets of the outer wall the jungle&#10;glared and shrieked, and the sun was furious above drenched orchids.&#10;A youth came striding through the steel-bossed doors, the sword-bitten&#10;doors that were higher than ten tall men. He was in flexible mail, and&#10;under the rim of his planished morion were amorous curls. His hand was&#10;out to her; before she touched it she could feel its warmth----&#10;&#10;&quot;Gosh all hemlock! What the dickens is all this stuff about, Carrie?&quot;&#10;&#10;She was no Syrian queen. She was Mrs. Dr. Kennicott. She fell with a&#10;jolt into a whitewashed hall and sat looking at two scared girls and a&#10;young man in wrinkled tights.&#10;&#10;Kennicott fondly rambled as they left the hall:&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Carol suggested forming a dramatic club and giving a play after the group had been discussing various topics in a light-hearted and humorous conversation. The shift to this idea came as a result of their conversation touching on the journey, tires, farming, and other amusing anecdotes. Carol's proposal was an attempt to create something artistic and beautiful within their town, which she felt would be more fulfilling than simply seeking easy entertainment or amusement." />
    <node id="The issues with &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; revolve around Carol's disappointment with the play's lack of artistic merit and message. She believes that the play is too lighthearted and lacking in depth, which contrasts with her desire for a more meaningful and thought-provoking piece of art.&#10;&#10;Comparatively, Bernard Shaw's work represents a higher level of &quot;holiness of drama&quot; for Carol. Shaw is known for his wit, intelligence, and social commentary, all of which align with Carol's preferences in theater. She sees Shaw's plays as more substantial and meaningful than popular shows like &quot;The Girl from Kankakee.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol's dislike for &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; highlights her desire for cultural enrichment and intellectual stimulation in Gopher Prairie, which is why she seeks to introduce thought-provoking and perhaps controversial works to the community. The success of &quot;The Girl from Kankakee,&quot; despite Carol's disappointment with it, suggests that there may be an appetite for more substantial theater offerings in the town, giving her hope that future productions could have a more positive impact on the community." />

    <node id=" are great&#10;lessons in some plays.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ella Stowbody, who was a professional, having studied elocution in&#10;Milwaukee, disapproved of Carol's enthusiasm for recent plays. Miss&#10;Stowbody expressed the fundamental principle of the American drama: the&#10;only way to be artistic is to present Shakespeare. As no one listened to&#10;her she sat back and looked like Lady Macbeth.&#10;&#10;&#10;III&#10;&#10;&#10;The Little Theaters, which were to give piquancy to American drama three&#10;or four years later, were only in embryo. But of this fast coming revolt&#10;Carol had premonitions. She knew from some lost magazine article that&#10;in Dublin were innovators called The Irish Players. She knew confusedly&#10;that a man named Gordon Craig had painted scenery--or had he written&#10;plays? She felt that in the turbulence of the drama she was discovering&#10;a history more important than the commonplace chronicles which dealt&#10;with senators and their pompous puerilities. She had a sensation of&#10;familiarity; a dream of sitting in a Brussels cafe and going afterward&#10;to a tiny gay theater under a cathedral wall.&#10;&#10;The advertisement in the Minneapolis paper leaped from the page to her&#10;" />
    <node id="Vida Sherwin suggests giving &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law&quot; for their artistic endeavor. This farce might be more appealing to some members of the group because it is not as intellectually challenging or unfamiliar as the other suggestions, such as a Dunsany play or a Greek drama like &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus.&quot; &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law&quot; is a lighthearted comedy that has been tested and proven to be popular in school entertainment settings. It may seem more accessible and entertaining to the group, particularly if they are looking for a play that is likely to please a wide audience. However, this suggestion does not align with Carol's vision of creating something artistic and meaningful, which is why she is reluctant to support it." />
    <node id="Carol Kennicott's determination to make a difference and bring about change in Gopher Prairie, as well as her perseverance, gave her the resolve to stay in the town. The initial success of selling out every seat for &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; and the formation of the Gopher Prairie Dramatic Association also provided motivation for her to remain in the town. Despite recognizing her own defeat in attempting to bring authentic theater to Gopher Prairie due to the group's lack of dedication and discipline, Carol Kennicott was committed to her goal of promoting cultural growth and intellectual stimulation in the community." />

There is a palpable sense of excitement and nervousness backstage as they prepare for their performance.

He is tasked with making them up for their roles, and he does so with a mix of scorn for amateurs and pride in his work. The actors seem to be both frightened and fascinated by the process, examining Del's makeup box, sniffing the scent of grease-paint, peeping through the hole in the curtain to watch the audience, and reading pencil inscriptions on the walls from previous troupers. Overall, there is a sense of community and shared experience among the actors, who are all in this together as they put on their play.">

When Carol says that there might be more fun in producing a perfect play rather than just having a circus, she means that the process of working hard to create something beautiful and artistic can provide a deeper sense of fulfillment and enjoyment than simply aiming for light-hearted entertainment or amusement. She believes that the challenge of creating something excellent, the satisfaction of improving oneself and one's craft, and the joy of sharing a meaningful creation with others can be more rewarding and memorable than merely putting on a show for easy laughs or thrills.&#10;2. Carol believes that creating a beautiful thing can bring pride, satisfaction, and even holiness because she values art and aesthetics as essential components of human experience and growth. She sees the process of making something beautiful as a way to connect with oneself, others, and the world in a deeper and more meaningful way. By striving for perfection, expressing one's ideas and emotions through artistic mediums, and sharing this creation with an audience, one can feel a sense of accomplishment, purpose, and transcendence that goes beyond mere material or superficial pleasures. In other words, creating something beautiful can be a spiritual experience that enriches one's life and the lives of others, fostering a sense of community, empathy, and appreciation for the human condition.">

She had hoped for something artistic and meaningful, but instead, she found the play to be predictable, unoriginal, and lacking in any message or artistic value.

When Carol says that there might be more fun in producing a perfect play rather than just having a circus, she means that the process of working hard to create something beautiful and artistic can provide a deeper sense of fulfillment and enjoyment than simply aiming for light-hearted entertainment or amusement. She believes that the challenge of creating something excellent, the satisfaction of improving oneself and one's craft, and the joy of sharing a meaningful creation with others can be more rewarding and memorable than merely putting on a show for easy laughs or thrills.&#10;2. Carol believes that creating a beautiful thing can bring pride, satisfaction, and even holiness because she values art and aesthetics as essential components of human experience and growth. She sees the process of making something beautiful as a way to connect with oneself, others, and the world in a deeper and more meaningful way. By striving for perfection, expressing one's ideas and emotions through artistic mediums, and sharing this creation with an audience, one can feel a sense of accomplishment, purpose, and transcendence that goes beyond mere material or superficial pleasures. In other words, creating something beautiful can be a spiritual experience that enriches one's life and the lives of others, fostering a sense of community, empathy, and appreciation for the human condition.">

Carol's initial suggestion of Shaw's &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; could be a good compromise as it is not as difficult as a Dunsany play but still offers more substance than &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law.&quot; Alternatively, they could explore other plays by contemporary playwrights known for their artistic merit and social commentary.">

These qualities helped create a strong connection between Maire Bruin's portrayal and Carol, making her feel as though she were seeing herself in the character.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the setting of the play and the atmosphere created by the actress allowed Carol to be transported from her sleepy small-town life with her husband to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where she could immerse herself in the green dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches. This setting enabled her to escape the mundane realities of her daily life and indulge in the beauty and allure of the ancient gods and twilight women presented in the play.&#10;&#10;Overall, Maire Bruin's captivating performance, combined with the dreamlike atmosphere of 'Land of Heart's Desire,' allowed Carol to momentarily disconnect from her provincial surroundings and enter a world filled with cultural richness and intellectual stimulation that she yearns for in her life.">

Carol believes that creating a beautiful thing can bring pride, satisfaction, and even holiness because she values art and aesthetics as essential components of human experience and growth. She sees the process of making something beautiful as a way to connect with oneself, others, and the world in a deeper and more meaningful way. By striving for perfection, expressing one's ideas and emotions through artistic mediums, and sharing this creation with an audience, one can feel a sense of accomplishment, purpose, and transcendence that goes beyond mere material or superficial pleasures. In other words, creating something beautiful can be a spiritual experience that enriches one's life and the lives of others, fostering a sense of community, empathy, and appreciation for the human condition.">

This is a result of her exposure to highbrow drama and her desire to experience new and exciting things.">

These qualities helped create a strong connection between Maire Bruin's portrayal and Carol, making her feel as though she were seeing herself in the character.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the setting of the play and the atmosphere created by the actress allowed Carol to be transported from her sleepy small-town life with her husband to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where she could immerse herself in the green dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches. This setting enabled her to escape the mundane realities of her daily life and indulge in the beauty and allure of the ancient gods and twilight women presented in the play.&#10;&#10;Overall, Maire Bruin's captivating performance, combined with the dreamlike atmosphere of 'Land of Heart's Desire,' allowed Carol to momentarily disconnect from her provincial surroundings and enter a world filled with cultural richness and intellectual stimulation that she yearns for in her life.">

When Carol says that there might be more fun in producing a perfect play rather than just having a circus, she means that the process of working hard to create something beautiful and artistic can provide a deeper sense of fulfillment and enjoyment than simply aiming for light-hearted entertainment or amusement. She believes that the challenge of creating something excellent, the satisfaction of improving oneself and one's craft, and the joy of sharing a meaningful creation with others can be more rewarding and memorable than merely putting on a show for easy laughs or thrills.&#10;2. Carol believes that creating a beautiful thing can bring pride, satisfaction, and even holiness because she values art and aesthetics as essential components of human experience and growth. She sees the process of making something beautiful as a way to connect with oneself, others, and the world in a deeper and more meaningful way. By striving for perfection, expressing one's ideas and emotions through artistic mediums, and sharing this creation with an audience, one can feel a sense of accomplishment, purpose, and transcendence that goes beyond mere material or superficial pleasures.

The cast's behavior towards rehearsals negatively affects Carol's efforts to create something artistic because their lack of dedication, discipline, and low artistic standards clash with her vision for the theater. She aims to produce high-quality, meaningful performances that go beyond light entertainment, but many of the actors prioritize easy laughs and applause from their relatives over delivering a good performance. This disregard for artistic values and neglect of hard work can be frustrating and demoralizing for Carol as she sees her efforts being undermined by the very people who should be helping to bring her vision to life.&#10;2. In terms of punctuality, the cast's behavior poses challenges because their tardiness or absence from rehearsals disrupts the schedule and makes it difficult to progress with staging the play. Carol emphasizes the importance of being on time and prepared for rehearsals, but her instructions often fall on deaf ears. Their lack of commitment further exacerbates this issue as unreliable actors may not show up at all, leaving important roles unfilled or causing delays in the rehearsal process. These challenges hinder Carol's ability to create a cohesive and polished performance, as it becomes difficult to maintain continuity when cast members are frequently absent or late.">

Firstly, Maire Bruin was an excellent actress who embodied the character's grace and innocence, being slim as Carol and larger-eyed, with a voice that resembled a morning bell. These qualities helped create a strong connection between Maire Bruin's portrayal and Carol, making her feel as though she were seeing herself in the character.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the setting of the play and the atmosphere created by the actress allowed Carol to be transported from her sleepy small-town life with her husband to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where she could immerse herself in the green dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches. This setting enabled her to escape the mundane realities of her daily life and indulge in the beauty and allure of the ancient gods and twilight women presented in the play.&#10;&#10;Overall, Maire Bruin's captivating performance, combined with the dreamlike atmosphere of 'Land of Heart's Desire,' allowed Carol to momentarily disconnect from her provincial surroundings and enter a world filled with cultural richness and intellectual stimulation that she yearns for in her life.">

When Carol says that there might be more fun in producing a perfect play rather than just having a circus, she means that the process of working hard to create something beautiful and artistic can provide a deeper sense of fulfillment and enjoyment than simply aiming for light-hearted entertainment or amusement. She believes that the challenge of creating something excellent, the satisfaction of improving oneself and one's craft, and the joy of sharing a meaningful creation with others can be more rewarding and memorable than merely putting on a show for easy laughs or thrills.&#10;2. Carol believes that creating a beautiful thing can bring pride, satisfaction, and even holiness because she values art and aesthetics as essential components of human experience and growth. She sees the process of making something beautiful as a way to connect with oneself, others, and the world in a deeper and more meaningful way. By striving for perfection, expressing one's ideas and emotions through artistic mediums, and sharing this creation with an audience, one can feel a sense of accomplishment, purpose, and transcendence that goes beyond mere material or superficial pleasures. In other words, creating something beautiful can be a spiritual experience that enriches one's life and the lives of others, fostering a sense of community, empathy, and appreciation for the human condition.">

The cast's behavior towards rehearsals negatively affects Carol's efforts to create something artistic because their lack of dedication, discipline, and low artistic standards clash with her vision for the theater. She aims to produce high-quality, meaningful performances that go beyond light entertainment, but many of the actors prioritize easy laughs and applause from their relatives over delivering a good performance. This disregard for artistic values and neglect of hard work can be frustrating and demoralizing for Carol as she sees her efforts being undermined by the very people who should be helping to bring her vision to life.&#10;2. In terms of punctuality, the cast's behavior poses challenges because their tardiness or absence from rehearsals disrupts the schedule and makes it difficult to progress with staging the play. Carol emphasizes the importance of being on time and prepared for rehearsals, but her instructions often fall on deaf ears. Their lack of commitment further exacerbates this issue as unreliable actors may not show up at all, leaving important roles unfilled or causing delays in the rehearsal process. These challenges hinder Carol's ability to create a cohesive and polished performance, as it becomes difficult to maintain continuity when cast members are frequently absent or late.">

    <edge source="Carol Kennicott found Maire Bruin's portrayal of the girl in Yeats' 'Land of Heart's Desire' captivating due to several factors. Firstly, Maire Bruin was an excellent actress who embodied the character's grace and innocence, being slim as Carol and larger-eyed, with a voice that resembled a morning bell. These qualities helped create a strong connection between Maire Bruin's portrayal and Carol, making her feel as though she were seeing herself in the character.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the setting of the play and the atmosphere created by the actress allowed Carol to be transported from her sleepy small-town life with her husband to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where she could immerse herself in the green dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches. This setting enabled her to escape the mundane realities of her daily life and indulge in the beauty and allure of the ancient gods and twilight women presented in the play.&#10;&#10;Overall, Maire Bruin's captivating performance, combined with the dreamlike atmosphere of 'Land of Heart's Desire,' allowed Carol to momentarily disconnect from her provincial surroundings and enter a world filled with cultural richness and intellectual stimulation that she yearns for in her life." target=" claims he wants a fellow&#10;to make love to his wife.

In her, Carol lived, and on her lifting voice was&#10;transported from this sleepy small-town husband and all the rows of&#10;polite parents to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where in a green&#10;dimness, beside a window caressed by linden branches, she bent over a&#10;chronicle of twilight women and the ancient gods.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--gosh--nice kid played that girl--good-looker,&quot; said Kennicott.">

Carol's proposal was an attempt to create something artistic and beautiful within their town, which she felt would be more fulfilling than simply seeking easy entertainment or amusement." target="Vida Sherwin suggests giving &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law&quot; for their artistic endeavor. This farce might be more appealing to some members of the group because it is not as intellectually challenging or unfamiliar as the other suggestions, such as a Dunsany play or a Greek drama like &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus.&quot; &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law&quot; is a lighthearted comedy that has been tested and proven to be popular in school entertainment settings. It may seem more accessible and entertaining to the group, particularly if they are looking for a play that is likely to please a wide audience.

    <edge source="The issues with &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; revolve around Carol's disappointment with the play's lack of artistic merit and message. She believes that the play is too lighthearted and lacking in depth, which contrasts with her desire for a more meaningful and thought-provoking piece of art.&#10;&#10;Comparatively, Bernard Shaw's work represents a higher level of &quot;holiness of drama&quot; for Carol. Shaw is known for his wit, intelligence, and social commentary, all of which align with Carol's preferences in theater. She sees Shaw's plays as more substantial and meaningful than popular shows like &quot;The Girl from Kankakee.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol's dislike for &quot;The Girl from Kankakee&quot; highlights her desire for cultural enrichment and intellectual stimulation in Gopher Prairie, which is why she seeks to introduce thought-provoking and perhaps controversial works to the community. The success of &quot;The Girl from Kankakee,&quot; despite Carol's disappointment with it, suggests that there may be an appetite for more substantial theater offerings in the town, giving her hope that future productions could have a more positive impact on the community." target="Vida Sherwin suggests giving &quot;McGinerty's Mother-in-law&quot; for their artistic endeavor.

    <edge source="The result of Sam Clark boastfully writing about the dramatic association to his schoolmate, Percy Bresnahan, was that they received a check for a hundred dollars. With Sam adding twenty-five dollars, they had a starting fund for their play. They used the funds to rent the second floor of the city hall and transform it into a theater by clearing out bunting, ballot-boxes, handbills, and legless chairs. The group was initially enthusiastic about putting on a play; however, they soon faced challenges due to their lack of dedication and discipline during rehearsals. Despite some initial success and praise from the local newspaper, the Gopher Prairie Dauntless, Carol recognized her own defeat in her attempts to bring authentic theater to the town as the group's idea of 'hard work' did not align with her vision of creating something beautiful in the theater." target=" are great&#10;lessons in some plays.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ella Stowbody, who was a professional, having studied elocution in&#10;Milwaukee, disapproved of Carol's enthusiasm for recent plays. Miss&#10;Stowbody expressed the fundamental principle of the American drama: the&#10;only way to be artistic is to present Shakespeare. As no one listened to&#10;her she sat back and looked like Lady Macbeth.&#10;&#10;&#10;III&#10;&#10;&#10;The Little Theaters, which were to give piquancy to American drama three&#10;or four years later, were only in embryo. But of this fast coming revolt&#10;Carol had premonitions. She knew from some lost magazine article that&#10;in Dublin were innovators called The Irish Players. She knew confusedly&#10;that a man named Gordon Craig had painted scenery--or had he written&#10;plays? She felt that in the turbulence of the drama she was discovering&#10;a history more important than the commonplace chronicles which dealt&#10;with senators and their pompous puerilities. She had a sensation of&#10;familiarity; a dream of sitting in a Brussels cafe and going afterward&#10;to a tiny gay theater under a cathedral wall.&#10;&#10;The advertisement in the Minneapolis paper leaped from the page to her&#10;">

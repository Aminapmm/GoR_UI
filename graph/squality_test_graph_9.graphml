    <node id="1. The genetic modification process that Max is describing involves adapting human cells to be able to digest and utilize the alien food sources found on the planet Minos. This was done by Alexander P. Mead through a rapid evolution process, where human cells were turned into phagocytes and exposed to harsh conditions with indigestible food. The cells that eventually learned to absorb this food were then reintroduced into the people they were taken from, allowing them to hunt, plant, and eat Minos food.&#10;&#10;2. Once this genetic modification has been done, a person will no longer be able to digest regular ship food. This is because their cells have been chemically adapted to the unique protoplasm of Minos, with different amino linkages and left-handed instead of right-handed molecules in carbohydrates. If they were to consume regular food, it would not be digestible, leading to a feeling of constant hunger even when their stomachs are full.&#10;&#10;3. The genetic modification is described as a one-way street, emphasizing the permanence of this change. It has allowed the Mead clan and others who have undergone the process to thrive on Minos by living off its land, but it also means they can never return to eating regular food from ships or other planets." />

It would have taken many human generations to adapt to Minos by ordinary evolution, and that only at a heavy toll of death and hunger which evolution exacts. There was a shorter way: Human cells have the ability to return to their primeval condition of independence, hunting, eating and reproducing alone.&#10; &#10; Alexander P. Mead took human cells and made them into phagocytes. He put them through the hard savage school of evolution—a thousand generations of multiplication, hardship and hunger, with the alien indigestible food always present, offering its reward of plenty to the cell that reluctantly learned to absorb it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Leucocytes can run through several thousand generations of evolution in six months,&quot; Pat Mead finished. &quot;When they reached to a point where they would absorb Minos food, he planted them back in the people he had taken them from.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What was supposed to happen then?&quot; Max asked, leaning forward.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know exactly how it worked.

He tried it on all the Meads the first year. The other settlers didn't want to be experimented on until they saw how it worked out. It worked. The Meads could hunt, and plant while the other settlers were still eating out of hydroponics tanks.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It worked,&quot; said Max to Len. &quot;You're a plant geneticist and a tank culture expert. There's a job for you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Uh- uh !&quot; Len backed away. &quot;It sounds like a medical problem to me. Human cell control—right up your alley.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is a one-way street,&quot; Pat warned. &quot;Once it is done, you won't be able to digest ship food.

I thought you people had no doctors.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's a story.&quot; Pat leaned back again. &quot;Alexander P. Mead, the head of the Mead clan, was a plant geneticist, a very determined personality and no man to argue with. He didn't want us to go through the struggle of killing off all Minos plants and putting in our own, spoiling the face of the planet and upsetting the balance of its ecology. He decided that he would adapt our genes to this planet or kill us trying.

She felt disloyal. Pat was only a superb animal. Max was the man she loved. Or—was he? Of course he was, she told herself angrily. They had gone colonizing together because they wanted to spend their lives together; she had never thought of marrying any other man. Yet the sense of dissatisfaction persisted, and along with it a feeling of guilt.&#10; &#10; Len Marlow, the protein tank-culture technician responsible for the mushroom steaks, had wormed his way into the group and asked Pat a question. Now he was saying, &quot;I don't dig you, Pat. It sounds like you're putting the people into the tanks instead of the vegetables!&quot; He glanced at them, looking puzzled. &quot;" />

You'll have to show us how to make it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Len turned back to him. &quot;You people live off the country, right? You hunt and bring in steaks and eat them, right? Well, say I have one of those steaks right here and I want to eat it, what happens?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Go ahead and eat it. It just wouldn't digest.

Look,&quot; she pointed. &quot;See that patch of field on the south hillside, with the brook winding through it? I've staked that hillside for our house.

There's room for a few more people.&quot; He shook hands with the Bartons quickly. &quot;That is—you are people, aren't you?&quot; he asked startlingly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not?&quot; said Max with a poise that June admired.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, you are all so—so—&quot; Patrick Mead's eyes roamed across the faces of the group. &quot;So varied.&quot;&#10; &#10; They could find no meaning in that, and stood puzzled.&#10; &#10; &quot;I mean,&quot; Patrick Mead said into the silence," />

I ate it just for the taste.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hal Barton appeared quietly beside the table. &quot;Three of the twelve test hamsters have died,&quot; he reported, and turned to Pat. &quot;Your people carry the germs of melting sickness, as you call it. The dead hamsters were injected with blood taken from you before you were de-infected. We can't settle here unless we de-infect everybody on Minos. Would they object?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We wouldn't want to give you folks germs,&quot; Pat smiled. &quot;Anything for safety. But there'll have to be a vote on it first.&quot;&#10; &#10; The doctors went to Reno Ulrich's table and walked with him to the hangar, explaining. He was to carry the proposal to Alexandria, mingle with the people, be persuasive and wait for them to vote before returning. He was to give himself shots of cureall every two hours on the hour or run the risk of disease.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Reno was pleased. He had dabbled in sociology before retraining as a mechanic for the expedition. &quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, June's sudden interest in her appearance is due to the fact that she has just learned from Patrick Mead (Pat) that everyone on Minos, the planet they are exploring, looks like them.

No chance was taken of allowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; June stepped from the last shower stall into the locker room, zipped off her spacesuit with a sigh of relief, and contemplated herself in a wall mirror. Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall....&#10; &#10; &quot;I've got a good figure,&quot; she said thoughtfully.&#10; &#10; Max turned at the door. &quot;Why this sudden interest in your looks?&quot; he asked suspiciously. &quot;Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally get something to eat?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully, using a combination from the ship's directory. &quot;How're you doing, Pat?&quot;&#10; &#10; The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray.

    <node id=" &#10; &quot;In other words,&quot; she said, &quot;everyone on the planet looks like you and me?&quot;&#10; &#10; Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin.&#10;&quot;Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think that people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit so many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I suppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside down!&quot; He laughed and sobered. &quot;But then why wear spacesuits? The air is breathable.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;For safety,&quot; June told him. &quot;We can't take any chances on plague.&quot;&#10; &#10; Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the wind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take off the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins. Minos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Plague,&quot; Pat Mead said thoughtfully. &quot;We had one here. It came two years after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead families.

Tell him we sent you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Right!&quot; She turned and ran down the ramp like a small girl going to a fire. Max grinned at June and she grinned back. After a year and a half of isolation in space, everyone was hungry for the sight of new faces, the sound of unfamiliar voices.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; They climbed the last two turns to the cafeteria, and entered to a rich subdued blend of soft music and quiet conversations.

Once on, you'll be no good as a check for what the other Meads might have.&quot;&#10; &#10; Max was taking out a rack and a stand of preservative bottles and hypodermics.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you going to jab me with those?&quot; Pat asked with interest.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're just a specimen animal to me, bud!&quot; Max grinned at Pat Mead, and Pat grinned back. June saw that they were friends already, the tall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a stab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being smaller and frailer than Pat Mead.&#10; &#10; &quot;Lie down,&quot; Max told him, &quot;and hold still. We need two spinal fluid samples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the arm.&quot;&#10; &#10; Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed and inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine nerve surgeon on Earth.&#10; &#10; High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship and angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing.

Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which made shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast.&#10; &#10; They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing hamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of Pat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of antihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system would treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human blood cells, and fight back against them violently.&#10; &#10; One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive, so that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human cells, and thus succumb more rapidly.&#10; &#10; &quot;How ya doing, George?&quot; Max asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Routine,&quot; George Barton grun" />

One was the control; the other two had been given shots of Pat's blood from before he entered the ship, but with no additional treatment.

The three dead ones had been given strong shots of adaptive and counter histamine, so their bodies had not fought back against the attack.&#10; &#10; June glanced at the dead animals hastily and looked away again.

This genetic modification has made them unable to return to eating regular food from ships or other planets.&#10;2. Patrick Mead's arrival on Minos is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but it is implied that he came to meet and welcome the group of explorers who have just arrived on the planet. He is described as being casually dressed in a loin cloth and weapons, and seems comfortable in the environment of Minos. He is also curious about the explorers and their appearance, as they are &quot;varied&quot; compared to the uniformity of the Mead clan due to their genetic modification." />

The cells that eventually learned to absorb this food were then reintegrated back into the people they were taken from, enabling them to hunt and plant on the planet Minos.&#10;2. If Len decides to take on the job offer, he may undergo a similar genetic modification process that would adapt his cells to the unique protoplasm of Minos, with different amino linkages and left-handed instead of right-handed molecules in carbohydrates. However, this modification is described as a one-way street, meaning that once it is done, he will no longer be able to digest regular ship food and would have to live off Minos food for the rest of his life. If he were to consume regular food after the modification, it would not be digestible, leading to a feeling of constant hunger even when his stomach is full." />
    <node id="1. The chemical differences that prevent humans from digesting Minos' food sources are the presence of different amino linkages and left-handed molecules in carbohydrates, which are not found in regular ship food. These differences make it impossible for human cells to break down and utilize the nutrients in Minos food, leading to constant hunger even when consuming regular food.&#10;2. Humans can adapt to consume local sustenance on Minos through a process of genetic modification developed by Alexander P. Mead. This process involves turning human cells into phagocytes and exposing them to harsh conditions with indigestible food for a thousand generations of multiplication, hardship, and hunger.

    <node id="1. Pat and their town can play a crucial role in determining if they are still carrying the melting sickness by participating in medical testing. The doctors take blood samples from Pat and inject them into hamsters. Based on the reaction of the hamsters, they determine that Pat's people carry the germs of the melting sickness. To settle on Minos, the expedition's doctors must de-infect everyone on the planet to avoid spreading the disease.&#10;2. Avoiding contact with their people until this is determined is important because even if the carriers of the disease do not show symptoms, they could still pass on the germs and potentially wipe out a planet.

    <node id="1. The result of Alexander P. Mead's experiment was that humans could now hunt, plant, and eat Minos food, allowing them to thrive on Minos by living off its land. This was achieved by turning human cells into phagocytes and exposing them to harsh conditions with indigestible food for a thousand generations of multiplication, hardship, and hunger. The cells that eventually learned to absorb this food were then reintegrated back into the people they were taken from.&#10;2. Mead planted the modified cells back into the people he had taken them from because those cells were now able to utilize the unique protoplasm of Minos, which has different amino linkages and left-handed instead of right-handed molecules in carbohydrates. By reintegrating these cells into humans, Mead enabled them to digest and utilize Minos food sources.&#10;3. It is important to note that this genetic modification is a one-way street, meaning that once the modification has been done, humans will no longer be able to consume regular ship food and must live off Minos food for the rest of their lives. This emphasizes the permanence of this change." />
    <node id="1. The chemical differences that prevent humans from digesting Minos' food sources are the presence of different amino linkages and left-handed molecules in carbohydrates, which are not found in regular ship food. These differences make it impossible for human cells to break down and utilize the nutrients in Minos food, leading to constant hunger even when consuming regular food.&#10;2. To overcome this issue, Alexander P. Mead developed a process of genetic modification that involves turning human cells into phagocytes and exposing them to harsh conditions with indigestible food for a thousand generations of multiplication, hardship, and hunger.

This is part of an experiment to adapt humans to be able to digest and utilize the alien food sources found on the planet Minos.&#10;2. The administration of adaptives and antihistaminics affects the reaction of the hamsters to non-hamster cells by suppressing their immune system's response to foreign substances. This is done to simulate the effects of human adaptation to the alien food source, as the human body would need to accept and process the new food without treating it as an enemy and fighting against it.&#10;3. The hamsters that were given extra doses of adaptive did not fight off the illness (leucosis and anemia) as effectively as the others, resulting in their death. This suggests that suppressing the immune system too much can have negative consequences and make the body more susceptible to disease." />

They are taking samples of the animals and testing them for contagion in controlled conditions before determining if it is safe to interact with the alien species.&#10;5. These precautions are necessary because the doctors fear that even though the animals may appear similar to those on Earth, their diseases could be deadly and untreatable for humans. Previous colonies have been wiped out by such diseases, making it crucial for the Explorer's crew to take every possible precaution before interacting with the alien life forms." />

There was warning enough in the past. Colonies had vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships which had touched on some plague planet.&#10; &#10; The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight spacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion.&#10; &#10; The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the alien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the copper and purple shadows.&#10; &#10; They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker browns.

Three other hamsters were still feverish and ruffled, with a low red blood count, but they were recovering from the illness. These hamsters did not receive any treatment, so their bodies were able to mount an immune response against the disease.&#10;3. The three dead hamsters had been given strong shots of adaptive and counter histamine. This suppressed their immune system's response to the foreign substance (Pat's blood), making them unable to fight off leucosis and anemia, which led to their death.&#10;4.

    <node id="1. When Patrick Mead says that the group is &quot;varied,&quot; he means that they display a range of physical differences in their appearance, such as variations in hair color, nose shape, and other distinguishing characteristics. This is in contrast to the population of Minos, which has undergone genetic modification to adapt to the alien food sources on the planet, resulting in a uniform appearance among its inhabitants due to their shared genetic traits. Therefore, Patrick Mead's comment about finding the group varied suggests that they stand out from the typical physical characteristics of the people of Minos, and this difference is what prompts his curiosity about their appearance.&#10;2. Additionally, when he asks &quot;you are people, aren't you?&quot; he may be expressing uncertainty or surprise at their different appearance, as if they do not fit the mold of what he expects humans on Minos to look like. He may also be inquiring about their population on Minos because he is curious if there are more people like them on the planet, as it is unusual for him to see such variation in physical characteristics among the inhabitants of Minos." />

Pat then undergoes a procedure where the expedition's doctor, Max, extracts spinal fluid samples and body cavity samples from him using hypodermic needles.&#10;2. In contrast, the ultimate cure-all for any non-human cells stored on the Explorer is a solution of enzymes that is so similar to human cell nuclei that it causes chemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. This solution can only be in contact with human cells and nothing else can live in it, making it a powerful tool for ensuring that the expedition's crew remains free from any potential diseases carried by the native population of Minos.">

He is a member of the Mead clan, who have undergone genetic modification in order to be able to digest and utilize the alien food sources found on Minos. This genetic modification has made them unable to return to eating regular food from ships or other planets.&#10;2. Patrick Mead's arrival on Minos is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but it is implied that he came to meet and welcome the group of explorers who have just arrived on the planet. He is described as being casually dressed in a loin cloth and weapons, and seems comfortable in the environment of Minos. He is also curious about the explorers and their appearance, as they are &quot;varied&quot; compared to the uniformity of the Mead clan due to their genetic modification.">

This is in contrast to the population of Minos, which has undergone genetic modification to adapt to the alien food sources on the planet, resulting in a uniform appearance among its inhabitants due to their shared genetic traits.&#10;3. Therefore, Patrick Mead's comment about finding the group varied suggests that they stand out from the typical physical characteristics of the people of Minos, and this difference is what prompts his curiosity about their appearance.&#10;4. Additionally, when he asks &quot;you are people, aren't you?&quot; he may be expressing uncertainty or surprise at their different appearance, as if they do not fit the mold of what he expects humans on Minos to look like.">

The purpose of injecting Pat Mead's blood into hamsters is to test its safety for potential human consumption or use as a food source. This is part of an experiment to adapt humans to be able to digest and utilize the alien food sources found on the planet Minos.&#10;2. The administration of adaptives and antihistaminics affects the reaction of the hamsters to non-hamster cells by suppressing their immune system's response to foreign substances. This is done to simulate the effects of human adaptation to the alien food source, as the human body would need to accept and process the new food without treating it as an enemy and fighting against it.&#10;3. The hamsters that were given extra doses of adaptive did not fight off the illness (leucosis and anemia) as effectively as the others, resulting in their death. This suggests that suppressing the immune system too much can have negative consequences and make the body more susceptible to disease.">

The doctors take blood samples from Pat and inject them into hamsters. Based on the reaction of the hamsters, they determine that Pat's people carry the germs of the melting sickness. To settle on Minos, the expedition's doctors must de-infect everyone on the planet to avoid spreading the disease.&#10;2. Avoiding contact with their people until this is determined is important because even if the carriers of the disease do not show symptoms, they could still pass on the germs and potentially wipe out a planet.

Three other hamsters were still feverish and ruffled, with a low red blood count, but they were recovering from the illness. These hamsters did not receive any treatment, so their bodies were able to mount an immune response against the disease.&#10;3. The three dead hamsters had been given strong shots of adaptive and counter histamine. This suppressed their immune system's response to the foreign substance (Pat's blood), making them unable to fight off leucosis and anemia, which led to their death.&#10;4. One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive, so that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human cells, and thus succumb more rapidly. This hamster also died from leucosis and anemia, indicating that suppressing the immune system too much can have negative consequences and make the body more susceptible to disease.">

The team will not be free to communicate openly with Pat's town until they know for sure that they do not carry the melting sickness." target="1. The three hamsters that were given shots of Pat's blood from before he entered the ship, but with no additional treatment, were able to fight off the &quot;melting sickness&quot; easily. This suggests that Pat's blood has some components or properties that help the hamsters resist the disease.&#10;2. Three other hamsters were still feverish and ruffled, with a low red blood count, but they were recovering from the illness. These hamsters did not receive any treatment, so their bodies were able to mount an immune response against the disease.&#10;3. The three dead hamsters had been given strong shots of adaptive and counter histamine. This suppressed their immune system's response to the foreign substance (Pat's blood), making them unable to fight off leucosis and anemia, which led to their death.&#10;4. One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive, so that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human cells, and thus succumb more rapidly. This hamster also died from leucosis and anemia, indicating that suppressing the immune system too much can have negative consequences and make the body more susceptible to disease.">

When Patrick Mead says that everyone on the planet looks like the group of colonists he's addressing, he means that they resemble him and June in terms of their physical features, such as hair color, nose shape, and other distinguishing characteristics.

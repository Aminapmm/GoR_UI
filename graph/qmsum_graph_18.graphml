The industrial designer mentioned that there is enough material for another button.&#10;3. The team discussed whether to make all the buttons special or just the &quot;apple&quot; button.&#10;4. They decided to have one special form button (the &quot;apple&quot; button) and use standard materials for the rest of the buttons, except for possibly using a special color for the volume buttons.&#10;5. There was also a discussion about adding a second layer, but it was decided to keep the design as is, with only the coloration of the buttons changed.&#10;6. The team debated whether these changes would make the product more fashionable and innovative, eventually deciding that they probably would not.&#10;7.

    <node id="hmm . {vocalsound} Have a push button interface .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . W the button supplements .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well do we'll do it on the prototype ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: O&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: so do two , see how much it is .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium ," />

Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But the {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but but the {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because {gap} the volume buttons are different ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing" />

    <node id="1.

They are aiming for a &quot;one&quot; on all of these criteria, but may need to adjust based on budget considerations.&#10;2. The industrial design team has presented a prototype of the product, which includes a single curve and a red &quot;apple&quot; button. The project manager originally planned for only one special button, but the industrial designer mentioned that there is enough material for another button. The team discussed whether to make all the buttons special or just the &quot;apple&quot; button, and decided on having one special form button (the &quot;apple&quot; button) and using standard materials for the rest of the buttons, except for possibly using a special color for the volume buttons.&#10;3.

    <node id="Based on the discussion transcript, the team decided that having replaceable batteries is more important than not losing the remote, given the need to reduce the total number of options by one and the requirement of including voice recognition as a minimum. This decision was made because voice recognition was considered crucial for helping users find their remote if it got lost, while using replaceable batteries would allow them to reduce the product's size and stay within their required size limit. Ultimately, the team believed that these benefits outweighed the potential drawback of having to replace the batteries." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And then still have the batteries ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: or whatever they would prefer not uh {disfmarker} You know what I mean ?

    <node id="1. If the product buttons were made of plastic instead of rubber, it would make a significant difference in terms of durability and size. Plastic would make the product more durable and help it &quot;stand the test of time better,&quot; as mentioned by the User Interface speaker. Additionally, using plastic rather than rubber would allow them to use the sample sensor and reduce the size of the product, as they could &quot;take out point two&quot; from their design requirements, as suggested by the Project Manager. This change could also help them stay within their required size limit.&#10;2. The modification would allow for keeping the kinetic sample sensor while potentially reducing the cost because plastic is generally less expensive than rubber. Additionally, using plastic instead of rubber for the case would free up space and resources that could be used to include the sample sensor, rather than having to &quot;take out point two&quot; from their design requirements. This trade-off would allow them to maintain the desired functionality while potentially reducing costs." />
    <node id="The marketing team is discussing the placement and color choices for the company logo and buttons on the product. They are considering adding a company logo button to the design, and have agreed upon a cherry design at the top of the prototype. The size constraints of the mute button have been acknowledged, but no final decision has been made.&#10;&#10;The marketing strategy is focused on creating a &quot;one&quot; rating for several evaluation criteria, including looking and feeling fancy, demonstrating technical innovation, being easy to use, incorporating a fashion element, and being a recognizable product. The team had originally planned for only one special button, but have now decided to include one special form button (the &quot;apple&quot; button) and use standard materials for the rest of the buttons, except for possibly using a special color for the volume buttons. This decision is aimed at making the product more fashionable and innovative while keeping it under the required size limit.&#10;&#10;The reason this marketing strategy may be considered sneaky is not explicitly stated in the transcripts. However, one possible interpretation is that the use of a cherry design instead of an apple design, as well as the decision to only make one button special (the &quot;apple&quot; button) and keep the rest of the buttons standard, could be seen as a way to differentiate the product from competitors without directly copying their designs. Additionally, there may be concerns about the use of a company logo button potentially influencing the impartial evaluation of the product." />

The marketing team mentioned the importance of the company logo and having a &quot;new sleek technology&quot; image, but there was no clear consensus or decision made on this matter.&#10;3. The industrial designer proposed a cherry design for the top of the prototype, which the team agreed upon, but it is unclear if this design aligns with the company's overall aesthetic.&#10;4. Additionally, the discussion touched on using plastic instead of rubber for the case, which could affect the product's feel and innovation aspect, but again, there was no explicit consideration of how this change would impact the product's alignment with the company's desired image or existing product lineup.&#10;5.

However, it can be inferred that the project manager has significant influence, as they suggested using plastic instead of rubber and changing the size and functionality of the product to include the sample sensor. The team discussed and debated these suggestions, but there is no mention of a higher authority making the final decision." />
    <node id="Based on the transcripts provided, the team decided to change the material of the case from rubber to plastic, which would also apply to the buttons except for the special red &quot;apple&quot; button. They also considered using a special color for the volume buttons, but there is no explicit decision about this in the transcripts. The use of rubber for the buttons was not explicitly discussed, but not having a rubber case was raised as a concern for innovation and overall feel of the product. Therefore, the proposed design for the buttons on the device would primarily use plastic, with a special red color for the &quot;apple&quot; button, and potentially a special color for the volume buttons." />
    <node id="1. The discussion about the importance of different colored buttons for tuning a device is not explicitly stated in the transcripts. However, there are some relevant points that were discussed:&#10;* The User Interface speaker suggested that all buttons could be small round blue buttons, including an enter button.&#10;* The Industrial Designer mentioned that one frequently used button (presumably for channel or volume control) should look good and fit the idea of what the client wants, while other functional buttons can have a simpler design.&#10;* The Marketing speaker emphasized the importance of quickly changing the channel or volume by hitting a button on the controller.&#10;&#10;Based on these points, it seems that the team recognizes the need for some buttons to be easily identifiable and accessible (such as the volume/channel control and enter button), but they did not explicitly discuss differentiating these buttons through color. Instead, the discussion focused more on the overall design and aesthetics of the buttons, with the exception of the special red &quot;apple&quot; button." />

I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah" />
    <node id="1. The marketing content speaker and project manager discussed including solar power and other functional features in the design while also considering the desire for a visually fancy look. They contemplated rating the product around two to three in terms of innovation, but there was no clear agreement on this rating.&#10;2. The project manager reminded the team that they have opted out of certain functional features such as solar power and are focusing more on the visual aspect of the design.&#10;3. The marketing content speaker suggested using speech recognition for the prototype, to which the industrial designer agreed, but noted that they do not have kinetic power in their budget.&#10;4. There was no clear consensus on whether the current prototype demonstrates technical innovation, as the marketing content speaker asked the project manager and industrial designer for their opinions on this matter." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: you think ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , why not not ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: m m maybe nearer three .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh-huh .

So {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , so that {disfmarker} so" />
    <node id="The main design change in the new product is the use of plastic instead of rubber for the case. This change was suggested by the Project Manager to make the product more durable, reduce its size, and keep the sample sensor. Although there were concerns about this change affecting innovation and the overall feel of the product, it was ultimately decided to proceed with the plastic case and only change the coloration of the buttons. The elimination in the new product is the addition of functional features such as solar power, which was opted out in favor of focusing more on the visual aspect of the design." />
    <node id="1. The main change to the standard buttons is the use of plastic instead of rubber for their material, affecting all buttons except for the special red &quot;apple&quot; button. This was suggested to make the product more durable, reduce its size, and allow for the inclusion of a sample sensor. Additionally, the team discussed changing the shape of the volume buttons to lemon-shaped, but no final decision was made.&#10;2. The role of kinetic energy in the new design is related to the inclusion of a kinetic sample sensor, which requires the use of plastic instead of rubber for the case and buttons to function properly. This modification allows for maintaining the desired functionality while potentially reducing costs and staying within the required size limit." />
    <node id="1. The team is discussing a cherry design for the button with the company logo. This decision was made because it would be more fun and fitting, although the exact reasons for this are not specified in the transcripts.&#10;2. Additionally, the team had previously considered using an &quot;apple&quot; design for the button, but ultimately decided against it due to concerns about being compared to Apple Mac. The idea of using a cherry design was officially confirmed by Marketing.&#10;3. The team did not explicitly discuss the importance of different colored buttons for tuning a device, but they did recognize the need for some buttons to be easily identifiable and accessible, such as the volume/channel control and enter button.&#10;4. The discussion about the color scheme for the cherry design is also not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, but it was agreed that the company color had not been established yet.&#10;5. Overall, the team seems to be focused on creating a recognizable product with a &quot;one&quot; rating for several evaluation criteria, including looking and feeling fancy, demonstrating technical innovation, being easy to use, incorporating a fashion element, and having a company logo button. However, they ultimately decided against adding a company logo button due to concerns about influencing the impartial evaluation of the product." />
    <node id="There is no mention in the transcripts of a &quot;design with nine point seven changes&quot; or any specific agreement on a design with that number of changes. The closest reference to this could be the discussion about adding a company logo button, considering several color options, and debating whether to make all buttons special or just the &quot;apple&quot; button. However, the transcripts do not provide enough information to determine a concrete outcome for a &quot;design with nine point seven changes.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. The next steps for changing the project to fit within the budget requirements involve reviewing the production cost to ensure it stays under the target of 12.5 Euros (as mentioned by the Project Manager). They have already opted out of certain functional features, such as solar power, to help control costs.&#10;   &#10;2. The numbers being used to calculate an average cost are likely related to the evaluation criteria discussed earlier in the meeting. Marketing suggested they aim for a &quot;one&quot; on all of them, understanding that adjustments may need to be made to fit within the budget. However, the exact method for calculating this average wasn't specified during the conversation. It was implied that they might add up the ratings and divide by the number of criteria, but this is not explicitly stated in the transcripts provided." />

    <node id="Based on the transcripts provided, a possible design solution for the product could include the following:&#10;&#10;1. Control Features: For the control features, the team discussed issues with labeling the mute button due to size constraints. One potential solution could be to use universally recognized symbols or icons for the buttons instead of text labels, which would help save space and make the controls more intuitive for users.&#10;2. Color Scheme: The team agreed on a cherry design for the top of the prototype, which suggests that a red or pink color scheme could be used for the product. This could be a fun and eye-catching design choice that helps the product stand out from competitors.&#10;3. Company Logo Integration: The team discussed adding a company logo button to the product design, but there were concerns about comparing the product without the company logo. One potential solution could be to include a subtle, debossed or embossed version of the logo on the back or bottom of the product, which would allow for easy comparison while still promoting brand recognition.&#10;&#10;Overall, these design solutions take into account the team's discussions around control features, color schemes, and company logo integration, while also aiming to create a visually appealing and functional product that meets the required size limits." />

The industrial design team has presented a prototype of the product, which includes a single curve and a red &quot;apple&quot; button. The project manager originally planned for only one special button, but the industrial designer mentioned that there is enough material for another button. The team discussed whether to make all the buttons special or just the &quot;apple&quot; button, and decided on having one special form button (the &quot;apple&quot; button) and using standard materials for the rest of the buttons, except for possibly using a special color for the volume buttons.&#10;3. There was also a discussion about adding a second layer, but it was decided to keep the design as is, with only the coloration of the buttons changed. Despite concerns about not having a rubber case affecting innovation, the project manager suggested that having all buttons as standard, except for the one red apple button, would take care of any issues and keep the product under the required size limit.&#10;4. Based on the conversation, it is clear that the team is considering several design elements in order to meet their evaluation criteria, including the use of special buttons and colors, as well as the overall feel and fashionability of the product.">

However, one possible interpretation is that the use of a cherry design instead of an apple design, as well as the decision to only make one button special (the &quot;apple&quot; button) and keep the rest of the buttons standard, could be seen as a way to differentiate the product from competitors without directly copying their designs. Additionally, there may be concerns about the use of a company logo button potentially influencing the impartial evaluation of the product.">

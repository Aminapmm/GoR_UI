    <node id="The speaker, Holgrave, has noticed a significant change in Phoebe, who has been working and living in the old Pyncheon house. He describes this change as a transformation that makes her appear thin, with a &quot;bleached, unwholesome aspect,&quot; and exhibiting shy behaviors that may indicate an impending old-maidenhood. Holgrave links Phoebe's changes to her exposure to the Pyncheon family history and their curse of wretchedness.&#10;&#10;He then discusses his theory about how families, especially those like the Pyncheons, who have a strong desire to establish and maintain a family lineage, contribute to much of the world's wrongdoing and misfortune. Holgrave believes that human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into the broader society at regular intervals, which would prevent the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors.&#10;&#10;The daguerreotype and old portrait come into play when Holgrave mentions a resemblance between the original perpetrator of the Pyncheon family's misfortune (possibly represented by Judge Pyncheon) and Clifford, who still lives and roams freely. The implication is that despite his physical existence in the world, Clifford has inherited and carries the same negative traits present in his ancestor. This perpetuation of a wretched inheritance further supports Holgrave's argument about the dangers of maintaining and idolizing family lineages.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave observes a change in Phoebe due to her exposure to the Pyncheon family history and their curse. He also uses this opportunity to discuss his belief that families should be periodically merged into society rather than preserving their lineage, as doing so perpetuates negative traits and behaviors. The daguerreotype and old portrait help illustrate Holgrave's argument by highlighting the resemblance between Clifford and a previous Pyncheon family member, suggesting an ongoing cycle of wretchedness." />

To plant a family! This idea is at the&#10;             bottom of most of the wrong and mischief which men do.  The truth is,&#10;             that, once in every half-century, at longest, a family should be merged&#10;             into the great, obscure mass of humanity, and forget all about its&#10;             ancestors.

A mere&#10;             observer, like myself (who never have any intuitions, and am, at best,&#10;                     only subtile and acute), is pretty certain to go astray.&quot;&#10;&#10;             The artist now turned the conversation to themes less dark than that&#10;             which they had touched upon.  Phoebe and he were young together; nor&#10;             had Holgrave, in his premature experience of life, wasted entirely that&#10;       " />
    <node id="Holgrave lives in the House of the Seven Gables because he is using it as a place to study the past and understand how to combat its negative influences. He explicitly states that he dwells there &quot;for a while, that I may know the better how to hate it&quot; (Nathaniel Hawthorne, The House of the Seven Gables). Holgrave has shared with Phoebe the story of Maule, the wizard, and her great-grandfather, as evidenced by Phoebe's statement &quot;I heard it long ago, from my father, and two or three times from my cousin Hepzibah, in the month that I have been here&quot; (Hawthorne, The House of the Seven Gables)." />
    <node id="            &quot;Then why do you live in it?&quot; asked Phoebe, a little piqued.&#10;&#10;             &quot;Oh, I am pursuing my studies here; not in books, however,&quot; replied&#10;             Holgrave.  &quot;The house, in my view, is expressive of that odious and&#10;             abominable Past, with all its bad influences, against which I have just&#10;             been declaiming.  I dwell in it for a while, that I may know the better&#10;             how to hate it.  By the bye, did you ever hear the story of Maule, the&#10;             wizard, and what happened between him and your immeasurably&#10;             great-grandfather?&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; said Phoebe" />
    <node id="      great-grandfather?&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; said Phoebe; &quot;I heard it long ago, from my father, and&#10;             two or three times from my cousin Hepzibah, in the month that I have&#10;             been here.  She seems to think that all the calamities of the Pyncheons&#10;             began from that quarrel with the wizard, as you call him.  And you, Mr.&#10;             Holgrave look as if you thought so too!  How singular that you should&#10;             believe what is so very absurd, when you reject many things that are a&#10;             great deal worthier of credit!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;I do believe it,&quot; said the artist seriously; &quot;not as a superstition,&#10;       " />
    <node id=", indeed, their extreme dissimilarity&#10;             should have proved a principle of mutual attraction.  Both, it is true,&#10;             were characters proper to New England life, and possessing a common&#10;             ground, therefore, in their more external developments; but as unlike,&#10;             in their respective interiors, as if their native climes had been at&#10;             world-wide distance.  During the early part of their acquaintance,&#10;             Phoebe had held back rather more than was customary with her frank and&#10;             simple manners from Holgrave's not very marked advances.  Nor was she&#10;             yet satisfied that she knew him well, although they almost daily met&#10;             and talked together, in a kind, friendly, and what seemed to be a&#10;" />
    <node id="       dizzy to think of such a shifting world!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;I certainly love nothing mouldy,&quot; answered Holgrave.  &quot;Now, this old&#10;             Pyncheon House! Is it a wholesome place to live in, with its black&#10;             shingles, and the green moss that shows how damp they are?--its dark,&#10;             low-studded rooms--its grime and sordidness, which are the&#10;             crystallization on its walls of the human breath, that has been drawn&#10;             and exhaled here in discontent and anguish? The house ought to be&#10;             purified with fire,--purified till only its ashes remain!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Then why do you live in it?&quot; asked Phoebe, a little piqued.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="   the full depth of my plummet-line!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;How strange that you should wish it!&quot; remarked Phoebe involuntarily.&#10;             &quot;What is Cousin Clifford to you?&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Oh, nothing,--of course, nothing!&quot; answered Holgrave with a smile.&#10;             &quot;Only this is such an odd and incomprehensible world! The more I look&#10;             at it, the more it puzzles me, and I begin to suspect that a man's&#10;             bewilderment is the measure of his wisdom.  Men and women, and&#10;             children, too, are such strange creatures, that one never can be&#10;             certain that he really knows them; nor ever guess what they have been&#10;             from what he sees them to be now" />

But, had you peeped at them through the&#10;             chinks of the garden-fence, the young man's earnestness and heightened&#10;             color might have led you to suppose that he was making love to the&#10;             young girl!&#10;&#10;             At length, something was said by Holgrave that made it apposite for&#10;             Phoebe to inquire what had first brought him acquainted with her cousin&#10;             Hepzibah, and why he now chose to lodge in the desolate old Pyncheon&#10;            " />
    <node id="The primary factor causing Clifford's overexertion and depletion seems to be the intense mental activity he engages in, as he constantly assimilates new sights, sounds, and events for his spiritual and intellectual growth. This mental effort is compared to a &quot;smouldering fire&quot; within him, consuming his vital energy. Clifford's state of &quot;second growth and recovery&quot; suggests that this mental exertion is strenuous and ongoing, leading to his exhaustion." />

As all is activity and vicissitude to the&#10;             new mind of a child, so might it be, likewise, to a mind that had&#10;             undergone a kind of new creation, after its long-suspended life.&#10;&#10;             Be the cause what it might, Clifford commonly retired to rest,&#10;             thoroughly exhausted, while the sunbeams were still melting through his&#10;             window-curtains, or were thrown with late lustre on the chamber wall.&#10;             And while he thus slept early, as other children do, and dreamed of&#10;             childhood, Ph" />
    <node id="IT must not be supposed that the life of a personage naturally so&#10;active as Phoebe could be wholly confined within the precincts of the&#10;old Pyncheon House.  Clifford's demands upon her time were usually&#10;satisfied, in those long days, considerably earlier than sunset.  Quiet&#10;as his daily existence seemed, it nevertheless drained all the&#10;resources by which he lived.  It was not physical exercise that&#10;overwearied him,--for except that he sometimes wrought a little with a&#10;hoe, or paced the garden-walk, or, in rainy weather, traversed a large&#10;unoccupied room,--it was his tendency to remain only too quiescent, as&#10;regarded any toil of the limbs and muscles.  But, either there was a&#10;smouldering fire within him that consumed his vital energy, or the&#10;monotony that would have dragged itself with benumbing effect over a&#10;mind differently situated was no monotony to Clifford.  Possibly, he&#10;was in a state of second growth and recovery, and was constantly&#10;assimilating nutriment for his spirit and intellect from sights,&#10;             sounds, and events which" />

Phoebe could not conceive what interested him so&#10;             much in her friends and herself, intellectually, since he cared nothing&#10;             for them, or, comparatively, so little, as objects of human affection.&#10;&#10;             Always, in his interviews with Phoebe, the artist made especial inquiry&#10;             as to the welfare of Clifford, whom, except at the Sunday festival, he&#10;             seldom saw.&#10;&#10;             &quot;Does he still seem happy?&quot; he asked one day.&#10;&#10;             &quot;As happy as a child,&quot; answered Phoebe; &quot;but--like a child, too" />

She was not so constantly gay, but had her&#10;             moods of thought, which Clifford, on the whole, liked better than her&#10;             former phase of unmingled cheerfulness; because now she understood him&#10;             better and more delicately, and sometimes even interpreted him to&#10;             himself.  Her eyes looked larger, and darker, and deeper; so deep, at&#10;             some silent moments, that they seemed like Artesian wells, down, down,&#10;             into the infinite.

    <node id="Holgrave uses the example of carrying around his dead grandfather's corpse to illustrate our slavery to bygone times, emphasizing how much we are still controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. When someone makes a will or dies intestate (without a valid will), their wealth and property are distributed according to their wishes or the laws of intestacy, which may not align with the desires or needs of the living.&#10;&#10;This concept highlights our enslavement to bygone times because even after a person's death, their decisions continue to impact the lives of those left behind, sometimes in ways that are no longer relevant or beneficial. The dead still have control over the living, as their wishes and property distribution are being carried out.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Holgrave points out how we live by the decisions, ideas, and creations of people who lived long ago and are now dead. We follow traditions, laws, and social norms established by our ancestors, often without questioning or adapting them to current times.

Instead, he holds on to the belief that things do not have to continue in the old bad way, and that there are signs of improvement. This matured form of faith is characterized by a deep-seated hope and a quiet acceptance of the world's complexities.

    <node id="When a family, especially one like the Pyncheons, clings excessively to their lineage and wealth, several detrimental consequences can arise. Firstly, it fosters an unhealthy obsession with preserving the family name and status, often leading to competition and conflict among relatives. This fixation on heritage can also result in misery, suspicion, disgrace, and various calamities, as seen in the Pyncheon family's history.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, maintaining a family lineage contributes to the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors. Holgrave argues that human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into broader society at regular intervals. By doing so, it would prevent the transmission of undesirable characteristics from generation to generation, ultimately breaking harmful cycles.&#10;&#10;In the case of the Pyncheons, their relentless pursuit of maintaining their family status has resulted in a wretched inheritance, as evidenced by Clifford's resemblance to a previous family member who caused much misfortune. This resemblance suggests an ongoing cycle of wretchedness that perpetuates itself through the generations.&#10;&#10;In summary, when families like the Pyncheons hold on to their lineage and wealth excessively, detrimental consequences such as familial conflict, the perpetuation of negative traits, and a self-replicating cycle of misfortune can occur." />

    <node id="Holgrave lives in the House of the Seven Gables despite his hatred for it because it serves as a place for him to study the past and understand how to combat its negative influences. He wants to know the house's history better so that he can hate it more effectively. Holgrave has shared with Phoebe the story of Maule, the wizard, who had dealings with her great-grandfather. This story is likely significant in understanding the house's history and its role in perpetuating the negative influences of the past.&#10;&#10;Holgrave lives in the old Pyncheon House not only to study it but also because he finds inspiration for his work as a daguerreotypist there. The house represents the &quot;odious and abominable Past&quot; that he wants to combat, making it an ideal place for him to dwell. Holgrave's disdain for the house is evident in his description of its physical condition, which he considers unwholesome and sordid. However, he continues to live there despite these unfavorable conditions, demonstrating his commitment to understanding and challenging the past's negative influences.&#10;&#10;In terms of sharing stories about the house's history, Holgrave has certainly told Phoebe about Maule, the wizard, who had a significant impact on her family's past. It is unclear whether Holgrave has shared any other specific stories about the house's history with Phoebe. However, given his interest in understanding and combating the negative influences of the past, it is likely that he has discussed other aspects of the house's history with her as well." />

Holgrave, as he told Phoebe somewhat&#10;             proudly, could not boast of his origin, unless as being exceedingly&#10;             humble, nor of his education, except that it had been the scantiest&#10;             possible, and obtained by a few winter-months' attendance at a district&#10;             school.

    <node id="Phoebe brings about positive changes in Holgrave's demeanor by making the House of the Seven Gables feel like a home to him, and its garden a familiar precinct. This occurs unintentionally on her part and unconsciously on his, as she goes about her daily routines. The young man himself observes this change, noting that he has grown warmer and more earnest in her company, even leading a third-party observer to mistakenly assume that he is making love to Phoebe.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Holgrave's interactions with Phoebe lead him to open up and share his thoughts and dreams freely, suggesting that he feels comfortable and at ease in her presence. This is significant given his initial wariness towards the Pyncheon family and his original purpose for dwelling in the House of the Seven Gables, which was to study its past and understand how to combat its negative influences.&#10;&#10;Overall, Phoebe's kindly intercourse and unassuming presence bring about a positive transformation in Holgrave's demeanor, making him feel more at home in the House of the Seven Gables and more willing to share his innermost thoughts and feelings." />

    <node id="Based on the description provided, the unnamed man (later revealed to be Holgrave) appears to have an intellectual interest in Hepzibah, her brother Clifford, and Phoebe, rather than a strong emotional affection. He studies them attentively and is knowledgeable about their individualities, but he doesn't seem to form a deep emotional connection with them. He is willing to help and do good to them, but he doesn't appear to &quot;make common cause&quot; with them or demonstrate increasing love as he gets to know them better. This lack of overt affection, combined with his earnest demeanor, might make him seem like he is making love to Phoebe if one were to observe from afar. Overall, Holgrave's interactions with Hepzibah, Clifford, and Phoebe suggest that he values their company and wants to understand them, but his affection may not be as strong or obvious as it might be for someone who is more emotionally expressive." />

He studied them attentively, and&#10;             allowed no slightest circumstance of their individualities to escape&#10;             him.  He was ready to do them whatever good he might; but, after all,&#10;             he never exactly made common cause with them, nor gave any reliable&#10;             evidence that he loved them better in proportion as he knew them more.&#10;             In his relations with them, he seemed to be in" />

Phoebe soon saw it likewise, and gave him the sort of confidence&#10;             which such a certainty inspires.  She was startled, however, and&#10;             sometimes repelled,--not by any doubt of his integrity to whatever law&#10;             he acknowledged, but by a sense that his law differed from her own.  He&#10;             made her uneasy, and seemed to unsettle everything around her, by his&#10;             lack of reverence for what was fixed, unless, at a moment's warning, it&#10;             could establish its right to hold its ground.&#10;&#10;             Then, moreover, she scarcely thought him affectionate in his nature.&#10;   " />

The old&#10;             house, as we have already said, had both the dry-rot and the damp-rot&#10;             in its walls; it was not good to breathe no other atmosphere than that.&#10;             Hepzibah, though she had her valuable and redeeming traits, had grown&#10;             to be a kind of lunatic by imprisoning herself so long in one place,&#10;             with no other company than" />
    <node id="Holgrave suggests that people are &quot;slaves to bygone times&quot; when it comes to their relationship with the past, particularly in how property is handled after a person's death. He explains this idea through the example of someone carrying around their dead grandfather's corpse, emphasizing that we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. When a person makes a will or dies intestate, their wealth and property are distributed according to their wishes or legal requirements, which may not align with the desires or needs of the living. This concept highlights our enslavement to bygone times because even after a person's death, their decisions continue to impact the lives of those left behind, sometimes in ways that are no longer relevant or beneficial. We live by the decisions, ideas, and creations of people who lived long ago, often without questioning or adapting them to current times. These elements from the past continue to shape and control modern society, making us &quot;slaves to bygone times.&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Holgrave's &quot;premature experiences&quot; in life have caused him to approach his youthful spirit and energy with a more measured and pragmatic perspective. While he once believed that he could &quot;mould [the world's granite substance] into whatever shape he likes,&quot; his experiences have led him to recognize the limitations of individual effort. However, this has not caused him to lose faith altogether; instead, he maintains a deep-seated hope and quiet acceptance of the world's complexities.&#10;&#10;Despite wasting some of his youthful energy through premature experiences, Holgrave has also developed a strong sense of self and purpose. He values his own observations and experiences over formal education or books, demonstrating a practical and self-directed approach to learning. Additionally, he is capable of forming deep connections with others, as evidenced by his relationship with Phoebe.&#10;&#10;Overall, Holgrave's premature experiences have had a complex impact on his perception and utilization of his youthful spirit and energy. While they may have tempered some of his idealism, they have also helped him develop a more nuanced perspective on life and learning. Ultimately, this evolution from youthful optimism to a more measured but still hopeful maturity is a positive and natural part of growing up." />

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Holgrave is a young man who has experienced life prematurely and has developed a more measured but still hopeful perspective. He has wasted some of his youthful energy through early experiences but has also gained wisdom and insight from them. Holgrave values his own observations and experiences over formal education or books and has a practical, self-directed approach to learning.&#10;&#10;Holgrave's current demeanor is characterized by his thoughtful turn of mind and quiet acceptance of the world's complexities. He recognizes the limitations of individual effort and believes that things do not have to continue in the old bad way. Despite this, he maintains a deep-seated hope for improvement.&#10;&#10;The setting of the narrative is New England life, where Holgrave has formed a relationship with Phoebe. Although they come from different backgrounds and perspectives, they share common ground and mutual attraction.&#10;&#10;In contrast to his current demeanor, Holgrave's true nature may be more optimistic and idealistic than he appears. At one point in his life, he believed that he could mold the world into whatever shape he liked. Although his experiences have tempered this belief, he still holds onto a sense of hope for improvement. Overall, while Holgrave presents himself as a thoughtful and measured individual, there is also evidence of a more vibrant and optimistic spirit within him." />
    <node id="Phoebe is uncertain about Holgrave's character due to their extreme dissimilarity, despite both of them being from New England and sharing common ground. She finds his lack of reverence for what is fixed and his eagerness to challenge established norms unsettling, as it contrasts with her own values and beliefs.&#10;&#10;Despite not questioning Holgrave's integrity, Phoebe finds him unsettling because his worldview and actions seem to undermine the stability and certainty she is accustomed to. She is startled and sometimes repelled by his differing law or principles, which create a sense of unease in her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Phoebe's uncertainty about Holgrave's character arises from their differences in values and beliefs, as well as his willingness to challenge established norms, which creates a sense of instability that she finds unsettling." />
    <node id="According to Holgrave's perspective, a person must become &quot;dead&quot; or disconnected from the current world in order to have a proper influence on it because our lives are heavily influenced by the decisions, ideas, and creations of people who lived long ago. By breaking free from these constraints and traditions, an individual can potentially exert their own influence more effectively. However, this detachment also implies that one's influence will only be fully recognized in the world of another generation, as the current society may not acknowledge or accept new ideas from someone still present within it.&#10;&#10;Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; like the House of the Seven Gables reinforces this idea by emphasizing how much we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. The property distribution, traditions, laws, and social norms that shape our lives are often established by our ancestors, and living in their physical structures serves as a constant reminder of this influence. To truly affect change, one might need to distance themselves from these remnants of the past to gain clarity on how to challenge or adapt them to current times.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave suggests that becoming &quot;dead&quot; to the current world means disconnecting oneself from the traditions and influences of the past in order to have a more significant influence on society. Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; highlights this idea by illustrating our continued adherence to the physical reminders and structures left behind by those who lived before us, which can limit our ability to fully embrace new ideas and perspectives." />

One subject, indeed, is but the&#10;             reverberation of the other.&#10;&#10;             &quot;Shall we never, never get rid of this Past?&quot; cried he, keeping up the&#10;             earnest tone of his preceding conversation.  &quot;It lies upon the Present&#10;             like a giant's dead body In fact, the case is just as if a young giant&#10;             were compelled to waste all his strength in carrying about the corpse&#10;             of the old giant," />
    <node id="The artist, Holgrave, has noticed a significant change in Judge Pyncheon's behavior. The judge, who is usually composed and calm, has become unusually earnest when discussing the perpetrator of a certain mischief and the resemblance between a daguerreotype and an old portrait. This behavior is surprising to Phoebe and even slightly alarming, making her wonder if the &quot;lunacy of the Pyncheons&quot; might be contagious.&#10;&#10;Holgrave explains his intense interest in the Pyncheon family by admitting that their history has deeply affected him since he started living in the old gable. To distance himself from the subject, he decided to transform an incident of the Pyncheon family's past into a legend for magazine publication.&#10;&#10;When mentioning Judge Pyncheon and Clifford, Holgrave describes them as a &quot;complex riddle&quot; and believes that understanding their complexities requires intuitive sympathy, like Phoebe's, rather than his own observational skills. This comparison highlights the difference in perception between Phoebe and Holgrave regarding the Pyncheon family.&#10;&#10;Holgrave then shifts the conversation to lighter topics, but Phoebe later asks about his connection with Hepzibah and why he chose to live in the old, empty Pyncheon House. In response, Holgrave turns the discussion towards the influences of the Past and expresses his frustration that society cannot seem to escape it. The Past's impact on the Present is a recurring theme in their conversation.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judge Pyncheon's unusual earnestness when discussing the Pyncheon family's past can be attributed to Holgrave's intense fascination with and study of the Pyncheons since moving into the old gable. The artist believes that understanding this complex family requires intuitive sympathy rather than mere observation, making him particularly passionate about uncovering their secrets." />
    <node id="1. Holgrave has a mixed view on the current state of society. He acknowledges its flaws and complexities but also sees signs of improvement. His experiences have tempered his earlier optimistic belief that he could shape the world as he wished, but he maintains a deep-seated hope for positive change.&#10;2. Holgrave believes that individuals are often &quot;slaves to bygone times,&quot; particularly in how property is handled after a person's death. He uses the metaphor of carrying around one's dead grandfather's corpse, emphasizing that we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. This concept highlights how society can be bound by traditions, laws, and social norms established by our ancestors, making us &quot;slaves to bygone times.&quot;&#10;3. Although Holgrave recognizes the limitations of individual effort, he still values the power of optimism and believes that things do not have to continue in the old bad way. This reflects his hope for a better future, even if it may not be entirely shaped by his own actions.&#10;4. Overall, Holgrave's view on society is marked by a balance between practicality, optimism, and acceptance of the world's complexities. He has evolved from a naive and idealistic young man to a more measured but still hopeful individual who values personal experiences and observations." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, we can infer that Holgrave has a strong sense of integrity and identity, despite his homelessness and nomadic lifestyle. The passage states that &quot;amid all these personal vicissitudes, he had never lost his identity&quot; and that &quot;it was impossible to know Holgrave without recognizing this to be the fact.&quot; This suggests that even though Holgrave changed his exterior and location frequently, he never compromised his inner self or violated his conscience.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Hepzibah's observation that Holgrave had carried his conscience along with him during his homelessness indicates that he has a strong moral compass and adheres to his personal values and beliefs. This further highlights his integrity and underscores his trustworthiness.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative suggests that Holgrave's experiences while homeless have not diminished his character or sense of self but rather reinforced his commitment to maintaining his identity and living according to his principles." />
    <node id="The &quot;person&quot; referring to Holgrave, the artist lodging in the old Pyncheon house. The change he notices is in Phoebe, who has been affected by her exposure to the Pyncheon family history and their curse of wretchedness. She appears thinner, with a bleached, unwholesome aspect, and shy behaviors that may indicate an impending old-maidenhood.&#10;&#10;Regarding the &quot;mischief,&quot; Holgrave implies that there is a perpetuator of misfortune within the Pyncheon family, possibly represented by Judge Pyncheon, who bears a resemblance to Clifford in both mind and body. This similarity suggests that Clifford has inherited negative traits from his ancestor.&#10;&#10;The daguerreotype and old portrait connection serve to illustrate Holgrave's belief that families, especially those with a strong desire to establish and maintain a family lineage, contribute to much of the world's wrongdoing and misfortune. Human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into the broader society at regular intervals, preventing the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave notices changes in Phoebe related to her exposure to the Pyncheon family's cursed history, while he uses the opportunity to discuss his belief that families should be periodically merged into society rather than preserving their lineage, as doing so perpetuates negative traits and behaviors. The daguerreotype and old portrait help illustrate Holgrave's argument by highlighting the resemblance between Clifford and a previous Pyncheon family member, suggesting an ongoing cycle of wretchedness." />
    <node id="Phoebe is uncertain about Holgrave's character due to their significant differences in values and beliefs, as well as his eagerness to challenge established norms. This contrasts with Phoebe's more conventional worldview and creates a sense of instability that she finds unsettling. Additionally, Phoebe does not perceive Holgrave as particularly affectionate, which further contributes to her questioning of his character. She feels that his principles differ from her own, leading to unease and uncertainty about the nature of their relationship.&#10;&#10;The text states: &quot;She was startled, however, and sometimes repelled,--not by any doubt of his integrity to whatever law he acknowledged, but by a sense that his law differed from her own... Then, moreover, she scarcely thought him affectionate in his nature.&quot; These lines indicate that Phoebe is not unsure about Holgrave's honesty or moral character, but rather that she perceives a fundamental difference between their values and principles. This difference, combined with her perception of Holgrave as less affectionate than she would like, leads to her uncertainty and unease around him." />
    <node id="Holgrave admits to being &quot;a little mad&quot; to emphasize his intense fascination and obsession with the Pyncheon family history. This interest has taken hold of his mind since he started living in the old gable. As a way of distancing himself from the subject and trying to throw it off, he transforms an incident of the Pyncheon family's past into a legend for magazine publication. This approach allows him to express his fascination with the Pyncheons while simultaneously attempting to free himself from their grasp on his thoughts." />
    <node id="The artist, Holgrave, is interested in understanding human nature and character, which drives his attentive observation of Phoebe, her friends, and the Pyncheon family. In the case of Clifford, Holgrave's fascination seems to stem from his curiosity about how someone who appears inert and isolated can still influence those around him.&#10;&#10;Despite not showing strong emotional concern for them, Holgrave finds intellectual value in their individualities and experiences. He is intrigued by the complex riddle they present and believes that solving it requires intuitive sympathy like Phoebe's. In the case of Clifford, Holgrave sees him as a part of this complex puzzle and is genuinely curious about his well-being, particularly if he remains happy.&#10;&#10;Holgrave's primary interest in people, including Phoebe and her friends, leans more towards intellectual curiosity than emotional attachment. He observes them closely to understand their motivations and behaviors, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he is forming a deep affection for them or becoming emotionally involved in their lives." />
    <node id="The artist argues that building houses for each generation, rather than for posterity, would imply almost every reform because it would encourage a shift in societal mindset. If each generation built its own houses, it would be a reminder that institutions and social structures are not fixed or eternal, but can and should be examined and reformed over time. This idea applies not just to private homes, but also to public buildings such as capitols, state-houses, churches, etc. The artist believes that this shift in mindset could lead to a greater willingness to question old ways of thinking and to embrace change and progress." />

If each generation&#10;             were allowed and expected to build its own houses, that single change,&#10;             comparatively unimportant in itself, would imply almost every reform&#10;            " />

This is represented as a &quot;giant's dead body&quot; because it weighs heavily on the present generation, draining their energy and stifling their growth. Clifford expresses frustration about never being able to get rid of it because he recognizes how the past continues to negatively impact himself and those around him. He longs for a future unburdened by the weight of history, but he sees no escape from its grasp." />
    <node id="The change Holgrave has noticed in Judge Pyncheon is an unusually intense and earnest interest in discussing the perpetrator of a past mischief, as well as the resemblance between a daguerreotype and an old portrait. This behavior is surprising and alarming to Phoebe, causing her to question whether the &quot;lunacy of the Pyncheons&quot; might be contagious. Holgrave's fascination with the Pyncheon family since living in the old gable has led him to study their history in depth, giving him unique insights into their complexities. He believes understanding this complex family requires intuitive sympathy rather than mere observation, making him particularly passionate about uncovering their secrets and contributing to his unusual earnestness during this conversation.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave's intimate knowledge of the Pyncheon family, gained from living in the old gable, has led him to develop a deep interest in their history, enabling him to notice subtle changes in Judge Pyncheon and contributing to his own intense reactions when discussing the Pyncheon family's past." />
    <node id="Building public edifices with perishable materials could serve as a powerful reminder for societies to regularly examine and reform the institutions they symbolize. This approach would literally embody the idea that social structures are not fixed or eternal, but rather mutable and subject to change. By physically deconstructing and rebuilding these symbols, communities might be more inclined to engage in critical discourse about their values, norms, and institutional practices.&#10;&#10;However, there could also be potential drawbacks to this strategy. For instance, using perishable materials for public buildings may not be a practical or cost-effective solution, as it would require frequent reconstruction. Additionally, the constant need for rebuilding might divert resources and attention away from other important social issues.&#10;&#10;A more feasible alternative could involve incorporating symbolic elements of impermanence within public edifices made from durable materials. For example, architects could design structures with features that naturally wear down or change over time, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the institutions they represent. This approach might encourage regular reflection and reform without incurring the impracticalities associated with constructing entirely perishable buildings.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while building public edifices with perishable materials presents some intriguing possibilities for fostering societal self-reflection and reformation, it also has practical limitations. A more balanced approach might involve integrating symbolic elements of impermanence into durable structures, thereby promoting critical engagement with institutional symbols without sacrificing functionality or resource efficiency." />
    <node id="The complexities of Judge Pyncheon and Clifford that can only be discerned by an intuitive person with sympathy, like a young girl's, involve understanding their true nature and motivations beyond mere external observations. An intuitive observer would be able to see past the judgmental and manipulative behavior of Judge Pyncheon, as well as the seemingly weak and dependent character of Clifford, and recognize any hidden depth, inner struggles, or emotions that are not immediately apparent.&#10;&#10;A mere observer like the artist, Holgrave, might easily misinterpret these complexities because his approach is based on analyzing people's behaviors, motivations, and experiences intellectually rather than emotionally or intuitively. He may miss subtle cues, nuances, or emotional undertones that would help him understand the true nature of Judge Pyncheon and Clifford.&#10;&#10;In summary, an intuitive person with sympathy can better perceive and comprehend the emotional and psychological complexities of both Judge Pyncheon and Clifford, whereas a mere observer might find it challenging to accurately interpret their intricate personalities due to a lack of emotional connection and intuition." />

He began as a country schoolmaster and later worked in a country store and as a political editor for a country newspaper.

In addition, he had experience in dentistry, which he studied and practiced with success in factory towns along inland streams.&#10;&#10;His travels took him to Europe, where he visited France, Germany, and Italy.

This fixation on heritage can also result in misery, suspicion, disgrace, and various calamities, as seen in the Pyncheon family's history.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, maintaining a family lineage contributes to the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors. Holgrave argues that human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into broader society at regular intervals.

As a young man, his enthusiasm and faith are characterized by a haughty belief in man's brightening destiny and a sense of optimism about changing the world. However, as he matures, his faith evolves into a more humble form. He comes to recognize man's helplessness and tempers his expectations, but he does not lose faith altogether. Instead, he holds on to the belief that things do not have to continue in the old bad way, and that there are signs of improvement. This matured form of faith is characterized by a deep-seated hope and a quiet acceptance of the world's complexities.

By breaking free from these constraints and traditions, an individual can potentially exert their own influence more effectively. However, this detachment also implies that one's influence will only be fully recognized in the world of another generation, as the current society may not acknowledge or accept new ideas from someone still present within it.&#10;&#10;Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; like the House of the Seven Gables reinforces this idea by emphasizing how much we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. The property distribution, traditions, laws, and social norms that shape our lives are often established by our ancestors, and living in their physical structures serves as a constant reminder of this influence. To truly affect change, one might need to distance themselves from these remnants of the past to gain clarity on how to challenge or adapt them to current times.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave suggests that becoming &quot;dead&quot; to the current world means disconnecting oneself from the traditions and influences of the past in order to have a more significant influence on society. Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; highlights this idea by illustrating our continued adherence to the physical reminders and structures left behind by those who lived before us, which can limit our ability to fully embrace new ideas and perspectives.">

This approach would literally embody the idea that social structures are not fixed or eternal, but rather mutable and subject to change. By physically deconstructing and rebuilding these symbols, communities might be more inclined to engage in critical discourse about their values, norms, and institutional practices.&#10;&#10;However, there could also be potential drawbacks to this strategy. For instance, using perishable materials for public buildings may not be a practical or cost-effective solution, as it would require frequent reconstruction. Additionally, the constant need for rebuilding might divert resources and attention away from other important social issues.&#10;&#10;A more feasible alternative could involve incorporating symbolic elements of impermanence within public edifices made from durable materials. For example, architects could design structures with features that naturally wear down or change over time, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the institutions they represent. This approach might encourage regular reflection and reform without incurring the impracticalities associated with constructing entirely perishable buildings.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while building public edifices with perishable materials presents some intriguing possibilities for fostering societal self-reflection and reformation, it also has practical limitations. A more balanced approach might involve integrating symbolic elements of impermanence into durable structures, thereby promoting critical engagement with institutional symbols without sacrificing functionality or resource efficiency.">

However, as he matures, his faith evolves into a more humble form. He comes to recognize man's helplessness and tempers his expectations, but he does not lose faith altogether. Instead, he holds on to the belief that things do not have to continue in the old bad way, and that there are signs of improvement. This matured form of faith is characterized by a deep-seated hope and a quiet acceptance of the world's complexities.

Firstly, it fosters an unhealthy obsession with preserving the family name and status, often leading to competition and conflict among relatives. This fixation on heritage can also result in misery, suspicion, disgrace, and various calamities, as seen in the Pyncheon family's history.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, maintaining a family lineage contributes to the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors. Holgrave argues that human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into broader society at regular intervals. By doing so, it would prevent the transmission of undesirable characteristics from generation to generation, ultimately breaking harmful cycles.&#10;&#10;In the case of the Pyncheons, their relentless pursuit of maintaining their family status has resulted in a wretched inheritance, as evidenced by Clifford's resemblance to a previous family member who caused much misfortune. This resemblance suggests an ongoing cycle of wretchedness that perpetuates itself through the generations.&#10;&#10;In summary, when families like the Pyncheons hold on to their lineage and wealth excessively, detrimental consequences such as familial conflict, the perpetuation of negative traits, and a self-replicating cycle of misfortune can occur.">

These elements from the past continue to shape and control modern society, making us &quot;slaves to bygone times.&quot;" target="According to Holgrave's perspective, a person must become &quot;dead&quot; or disconnected from the current world in order to have a proper influence on it because our lives are heavily influenced by the decisions, ideas, and creations of people who lived long ago. By breaking free from these constraints and traditions, an individual can potentially exert their own influence more effectively. However, this detachment also implies that one's influence will only be fully recognized in the world of another generation, as the current society may not acknowledge or accept new ideas from someone still present within it.&#10;&#10;Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; like the House of the Seven Gables reinforces this idea by emphasizing how much we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. The property distribution, traditions, laws, and social norms that shape our lives are often established by our ancestors, and living in their physical structures serves as a constant reminder of this influence. To truly affect change, one might need to distance themselves from these remnants of the past to gain clarity on how to challenge or adapt them to current times.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave suggests that becoming &quot;dead&quot; to the current world means disconnecting oneself from the traditions and influences of the past in order to have a more significant influence on society. Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; highlights this idea by illustrating our continued adherence to the physical reminders and structures left behind by those who lived before us, which can limit our ability to fully embrace new ideas and perspectives.">

This approach would literally embody the idea that social structures are not fixed or eternal, but rather mutable and subject to change. By physically deconstructing and rebuilding these symbols, communities might be more inclined to engage in critical discourse about their values, norms, and institutional practices.&#10;&#10;However, there could also be potential drawbacks to this strategy. For instance, using perishable materials for public buildings may not be a practical or cost-effective solution, as it would require frequent reconstruction. Additionally, the constant need for rebuilding might divert resources and attention away from other important social issues.&#10;&#10;A more feasible alternative could involve incorporating symbolic elements of impermanence within public edifices made from durable materials. For example, architects could design structures with features that naturally wear down or change over time, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the institutions they represent. This approach might encourage regular reflection and reform without incurring the impracticalities associated with constructing entirely perishable buildings.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while building public edifices with perishable materials presents some intriguing possibilities for fostering societal self-reflection and reformation, it also has practical limitations. A more balanced approach might involve integrating symbolic elements of impermanence into durable structures, thereby promoting critical engagement with institutional symbols without sacrificing functionality or resource efficiency.">

By breaking free from these constraints and traditions, an individual can potentially exert their own influence more effectively. However, this detachment also implies that one's influence will only be fully recognized in the world of another generation, as the current society may not acknowledge or accept new ideas from someone still present within it.&#10;&#10;Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; like the House of the Seven Gables reinforces this idea by emphasizing how much we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. The property distribution, traditions, laws, and social norms that shape our lives are often established by our ancestors, and living in their physical structures serves as a constant reminder of this influence. To truly affect change, one might need to distance themselves from these remnants of the past to gain clarity on how to challenge or adapt them to current times.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave suggests that becoming &quot;dead&quot; to the current world means disconnecting oneself from the traditions and influences of the past in order to have a more significant influence on society. Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; highlights this idea by illustrating our continued adherence to the physical reminders and structures left behind by those who lived before us, which can limit our ability to fully embrace new ideas and perspectives.">

    <edge source="When a family, especially one like the Pyncheons, clings excessively to their lineage and wealth, several detrimental consequences can arise. Firstly, it fosters an unhealthy obsession with preserving the family name and status, often leading to competition and conflict among relatives. This fixation on heritage can also result in misery, suspicion, disgrace, and various calamities, as seen in the Pyncheon family's history.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, maintaining a family lineage contributes to the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors. Holgrave argues that human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into broader society at regular intervals. By doing so, it would prevent the transmission of undesirable characteristics from generation to generation, ultimately breaking harmful cycles.&#10;&#10;In the case of the Pyncheons, their relentless pursuit of maintaining their family status has resulted in a wretched inheritance, as evidenced by Clifford's resemblance to a previous family member who caused much misfortune. This resemblance suggests an ongoing cycle of wretchedness that perpetuates itself through the generations.&#10;&#10;In summary, when families like the Pyncheons hold on to their lineage and wealth excessively, detrimental consequences such as familial conflict, the perpetuation of negative traits, and a self-replicating cycle of misfortune can occur." target="       &quot;I do believe it,&quot; said the artist seriously; &quot;not as a superstition,&#10;             however, but as proved by unquestionable facts, and as exemplifying a&#10;             theory.

The judge, who is usually composed and calm, has become unusually earnest when discussing the perpetrator of a certain mischief and the resemblance between a daguerreotype and an old portrait. This behavior is surprising to Phoebe and even slightly alarming, making her wonder if the &quot;lunacy of the Pyncheons&quot; might be contagious.&#10;&#10;Holgrave explains his intense interest in the Pyncheon family by admitting that their history has deeply affected him since he started living in the old gable. To distance himself from the subject, he decided to transform an incident of the Pyncheon family's past into a legend for magazine publication.&#10;&#10;When mentioning Judge Pyncheon and Clifford, Holgrave describes them as a &quot;complex riddle&quot; and believes that understanding their complexities requires intuitive sympathy, like Phoebe's, rather than his own observational skills. This comparison highlights the difference in perception between Phoebe and Holgrave regarding the Pyncheon family.&#10;&#10;Holgrave then shifts the conversation to lighter topics, but Phoebe later asks about his connection with Hepzibah and why he chose to live in the old, empty Pyncheon House. In response, Holgrave turns the discussion towards the influences of the Past and expresses his frustration that society cannot seem to escape it. The Past's impact on the Present is a recurring theme in their conversation.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judge Pyncheon's unusual earnestness when discussing the Pyncheon family's past can be attributed to Holgrave's intense fascination with and study of the Pyncheons since moving into the old gable.

She appears thinner, with a bleached, unwholesome aspect, and shy behaviors that may indicate an impending old-maidenhood.&#10;&#10;Regarding the &quot;mischief,&quot; Holgrave implies that there is a perpetuator of misfortune within the Pyncheon family, possibly represented by Judge Pyncheon, who bears a resemblance to Clifford in both mind and body. This similarity suggests that Clifford has inherited negative traits from his ancestor.&#10;&#10;The daguerreotype and old portrait connection serve to illustrate Holgrave's belief that families, especially those with a strong desire to establish and maintain a family lineage, contribute to much of the world's wrongdoing and misfortune. Human blood should &quot;run in hidden streams&quot; by merging families into the broader society at regular intervals, preventing the perpetuation of negative traits and behaviors.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave notices changes in Phoebe related to her exposure to the Pyncheon family's cursed history, while he uses the opportunity to discuss his belief that families should be periodically merged into society rather than preserving their lineage, as doing so perpetuates negative traits and behaviors. The daguerreotype and old portrait help illustrate Holgrave's argument by highlighting the resemblance between Clifford and a previous Pyncheon family member, suggesting an ongoing cycle of wretchedness.">

When a person makes a will or dies intestate, their wealth and property are distributed according to their wishes or legal requirements, which may not align with the desires or needs of the living. This concept highlights our enslavement to bygone times because even after a person's death, their decisions continue to impact the lives of those left behind, sometimes in ways that are no longer relevant or beneficial.

By breaking free from these constraints and traditions, an individual can potentially exert their own influence more effectively. However, this detachment also implies that one's influence will only be fully recognized in the world of another generation, as the current society may not acknowledge or accept new ideas from someone still present within it.&#10;&#10;Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; like the House of the Seven Gables reinforces this idea by emphasizing how much we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. The property distribution, traditions, laws, and social norms that shape our lives are often established by our ancestors, and living in their physical structures serves as a constant reminder of this influence. To truly affect change, one might need to distance themselves from these remnants of the past to gain clarity on how to challenge or adapt them to current times.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave suggests that becoming &quot;dead&quot; to the current world means disconnecting oneself from the traditions and influences of the past in order to have a more significant influence on society. Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; highlights this idea by illustrating our continued adherence to the physical reminders and structures left behind by those who lived before us, which can limit our ability to fully embrace new ideas and perspectives.">

If each generation built its own houses, it would be a reminder that institutions and social structures are not fixed or eternal, but can and should be examined and reformed over time. This idea applies not just to private homes, but also to public buildings such as capitols, state-houses, churches, etc. The artist believes that this shift in mindset could lead to a greater willingness to question old ways of thinking and to embrace change and progress.">

He explains this idea through the example of someone carrying around their dead grandfather's corpse, emphasizing that we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. When a person makes a will or dies intestate, their wealth and property are distributed according to their wishes or legal requirements, which may not align with the desires or needs of the living. This concept highlights our enslavement to bygone times because even after a person's death, their decisions continue to impact the lives of those left behind, sometimes in ways that are no longer relevant or beneficial. We live by the decisions, ideas, and creations of people who lived long ago, often without questioning or adapting them to current times.

Overall, Holgrave's interactions with Hepzibah, Clifford, and Phoebe suggest that he values their company and wants to understand them, but his affection may not be as strong or obvious as it might be for someone who is more emotionally expressive." target="The artist, Holgrave, is interested in understanding human nature and character, which drives his attentive observation of Phoebe, her friends, and the Pyncheon family. In the case of Clifford, Holgrave's fascination seems to stem from his curiosity about how someone who appears inert and isolated can still influence those around him.&#10;&#10;Despite not showing strong emotional concern for them, Holgrave finds intellectual value in their individualities and experiences. He is intrigued by the complex riddle they present and believes that solving it requires intuitive sympathy like Phoebe's. In the case of Clifford, Holgrave sees him as a part of this complex puzzle and is genuinely curious about his well-being, particularly if he remains happy.&#10;&#10;Holgrave's primary interest in people, including Phoebe and her friends, leans more towards intellectual curiosity than emotional attachment. He observes them closely to understand their motivations and behaviors, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he is forming a deep affection for them or becoming emotionally involved in their lives.">

    <edge source="According to Holgrave's perspective, a person must become &quot;dead&quot; or disconnected from the current world in order to have a proper influence on it because our lives are heavily influenced by the decisions, ideas, and creations of people who lived long ago. By breaking free from these constraints and traditions, an individual can potentially exert their own influence more effectively. However, this detachment also implies that one's influence will only be fully recognized in the world of another generation, as the current society may not acknowledge or accept new ideas from someone still present within it.&#10;&#10;Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; like the House of the Seven Gables reinforces this idea by emphasizing how much we continue to be controlled by those who have died and made decisions in the past. The property distribution, traditions, laws, and social norms that shape our lives are often established by our ancestors, and living in their physical structures serves as a constant reminder of this influence. To truly affect change, one might need to distance themselves from these remnants of the past to gain clarity on how to challenge or adapt them to current times.&#10;&#10;In summary, Holgrave suggests that becoming &quot;dead&quot; to the current world means disconnecting oneself from the traditions and influences of the past in order to have a more significant influence on society. Living in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; highlights this idea by illustrating our continued adherence to the physical reminders and structures left behind by those who lived before us, which can limit our ability to fully embrace new ideas and perspectives." target="Building public edifices with perishable materials could serve as a powerful reminder for societies to regularly examine and reform the institutions they symbolize. This approach would literally embody the idea that social structures are not fixed or eternal, but rather mutable and subject to change. By physically deconstructing and rebuilding these symbols, communities might be more inclined to engage in critical discourse about their values, norms, and institutional practices.&#10;&#10;However, there could also be potential drawbacks to this strategy. For instance, using perishable materials for public buildings may not be a practical or cost-effective solution, as it would require frequent reconstruction. Additionally, the constant need for rebuilding might divert resources and attention away from other important social issues.&#10;&#10;A more feasible alternative could involve incorporating symbolic elements of impermanence within public edifices made from durable materials. For example, architects could design structures with features that naturally wear down or change over time, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the institutions they represent. This approach might encourage regular reflection and reform without incurring the impracticalities associated with constructing entirely perishable buildings.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while building public edifices with perishable materials presents some intriguing possibilities for fostering societal self-reflection and reformation, it also has practical limitations. A more balanced approach might involve integrating symbolic elements of impermanence into durable structures, thereby promoting critical engagement with institutional symbols without sacrificing functionality or resource efficiency.">

    <node id="Quashyboo is a mysterious and controversial figure, with her history being a subject of debate among people. Some believed she was the criminal, while others thought she was innocent like a lamb, with her husband being at fault. She gained support by exhibiting frantic grief for her boy and managed to win over allies such as good Mrs. Alderney. Quashyboo's ability to evoke sympathy through her displays of emotion suggests that she is skilled in manipulating public opinion, which contributed to the division among people regarding her character. Despite this, it is evident that she had a difficult journey, facing rejections and hardships along the way." />

In a word, she did everything that was respectable, and that is&#10;why we dwell upon this part of her career with more fondness than upon&#10;subsequent parts of her history, which are not so pleasant. She saw&#10;people avoiding her, and still laboriously smiled upon them; you never&#10;could suppose from her countenance what pangs of humiliation she might&#10;be enduring inwardly.&#10;&#10;Her history was after all a mystery.  Parties were divided about her.&#10;Some people who took the trouble to busy themselves in the matter said&#10;that she was the criminal, whilst others vowed that she was as innocent&#10;as a lamb and that her odious husband was in fault. She won over a good&#10;many by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting the most&#10;frantic grief when his name was mentioned, or she saw anybody like him.&#10;She gained good Mrs. Alderney's heart in that way, who was rather the&#10;Queen of British Boulogne and gave the most dinners and balls of all&#10;the residents there, by weeping when Master Alderney came from Dr." />

He told&#10;Mr. Osborne of her sufferings--of her passionate attachment to her&#10;husband, whose memory she worshipped still--of the tender and dutiful&#10;manner in which she had supported her parents, and given up her boy,&#10;when it seemed to her her duty to do so.  &quot;You don't know what she&#10;endured, sir,&quot; said honest Dobbin with a tremor in his voice, &quot;and I&#10;hope and trust you will be reconciled to her.  If she took your son&#10;away from you, she gave hers to you; and however much you loved your&#10;George, depend on it, she loved hers ten times more.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;By God, you are a good feller, sir,&quot; was all Mr. Osborne said.

Well, she not only took&#10;tracts, but she read them.  She worked flannel petticoats for the&#10;Quashyboos--cotton night-caps for the Cocoanut Indians--painted&#10;handscreens for the conversion of the Pope and the Jews--sat under Mr.&#10;Rowls on Wednesdays, Mr. Huggleton on Thursdays, attended two Sunday&#10;services at church, besides Mr. Bawler, the Darbyite, in the evening,&#10;and all in vain.

And she was forced to fly into lodgings of which the&#10;dulness and solitude were most wearisome to her.&#10;&#10;Still she held up, in spite of these rebuffs, and tried to make a&#10;character for herself and conquer scandal.  She went to church very&#10;regularly and sang louder than anybody there.

    <node id="Lady Slingstone, who was previously ill, made an unexpected arrival on a boat. When Becky saw her, she regained her energy and walked into the Custom House unsupported, while Becky only laughed but felt alone. This encounter made Becky realize that she was becoming isolated, and the far-off shining cliffs of England seemed impassable to her.&#10;&#10;The men around Becky also started behaving differently. Grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity that was not pleasant. Little Bob Suckling, who used to be attentive towards Becky, was now talking to Fitzoof of the Guards without any regard for her. This change in behavior indicated that Becky's charm and influence over these men were waning.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Lady Slingstone's arrival on the boat and the change in the behavior of the men around Becky made her feel isolated and unwanted. This realization could have been a turning point in Becky's life, making her reconsider her actions and behavior towards others." />

Her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her&#10;carriage, and was greatly exhausted and scarcely fit to walk up the&#10;plank from the ship to the pier.  But all her energies rallied the&#10;instant she saw Becky smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet, and giving&#10;her a glance of scorn such as would have shrivelled up most women, she&#10;walked into the Custom House quite unsupported.  Becky only laughed:&#10;but I don't think she liked it.  She felt she was alone, quite alone,&#10;and the far-off shining cliffs of England were impassable to her.&#10;&#10;The behaviour of the men had undergone too I don't know what change.&#10;Grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity&#10;that was not pleasant.

But there was nothing in the story, only that&#10;Becky was always affable, easy, and good-natured--and with men&#10;especially.&#10;&#10;Numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the season,&#10;and Becky had plenty of opportunities of finding out by the behaviour&#10;of her acquaintances of the great London world the opinion of &quot;society&quot;&#10;as regarded her conduct.  One day it was Lady Partlet and her daughters&#10;whom Becky confronted as she was walking modestly on Boulogne pier, the&#10;cliffs of Albion shining in the distance across the deep blue sea.&#10;Lady Partlet marshalled all her daughters round her with a sweep of her&#10;parasol and retreated from the pier, darting savage glances at poor&#10;little Becky who stood alone there.&#10;&#10;On another day the packet came in.

Becky thought it was Major Loder and the Captain who frightened&#10;her.&#10;&#10;&quot;She mustn't stop here,&quot; Becky reasoned with herself. &quot;She must go&#10;away, the silly little fool.  She is still whimpering after that gaby&#10;of a husband--dead (and served right!) these fifteen years. She shan't&#10;marry either of these men.  It's too bad of Loder.  No; she shall marry&#10;the bamboo cane, I'll settle it this very night.&quot;&#10;&#10;So Becky took a cup of tea to Amelia in her private apartment and found&#10;that lady in the company of her miniatures, and in a most melancholy&#10;and nervous condition.  She laid down the cup of tea.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Amelia.&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen to me, Amelia,&quot; said Becky, marching up and down the room&#10;before the other and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous&#10;kindness.  &quot;I want to talk to you." />

Don't tell me about&#10;persecutors and enemies; an honest woman always has friends and never&#10;is separated from her family.  Why has she left her husband? He may&#10;have been disreputable and wicked, as you say.  He always was.  I&#10;remember the confounded blackleg and the way in which he used to cheat&#10;and hoodwink poor George.  Wasn't there a scandal about their&#10;separation? I think I heard something,&quot; cried out Major Dobbin, who did&#10;not care much about gossip, and whom Jos tried in vain to convince that&#10;Mrs. Becky was in all respects a most injured and virtuous female.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well; let's ask Mrs. George,&quot; said that arch-diplomatist of a&#10;Major.  &quot;Only let us go and consult her.

She was&#10;staying at the hotel at Dieppe, whither Becky fled, and they made each&#10;other's acquaintance first at sea, where they were swimming together,&#10;and subsequently at the table d'hote of the hotel.  Mrs Eagles had&#10;heard--who indeed had not?--some of the scandal of the Steyne affair;&#10;but after a conversation with Becky, she pronounced that Mrs. Crawley&#10;was an angel, her husband a ruffian, Lord Steyne an unprincipled&#10;wretch, as everybody knew, and the whole case against Mrs. Crawley an&#10;infamous and wicked conspiracy of that rascal Wenham.  &quot;If you were a&#10;man of any spirit, Mr. Eagles, you would box the wretch's ears the next&#10;time you see him at the Club,&quot; she said to her husband.

    <node id="In the narrative, Miss Crawford, who is referred to as &quot;she,&quot; has a cautious and puzzled reaction to my lord's affable behavior. She doesn't find him fascinating but instead views him as something curious or unusual due to his exaggerated manners, simpering grin, scented handkerchief, and high-heeled boots. The narrator explains that she hasn't met a professional ladies' man before, which contributes to her wariness.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Jos is delighted with my lord's affable attitude. He sees it as a mark of politeness and kindness, and he decides to pay his respects at court as soon as possible. Jos is so impressed that he even receives the Diplomatist with honors when he calls on the party.&#10;&#10;The difference in their reactions can be attributed to their personalities and past experiences. Miss Crawford, who has presumably had interactions with flirtatious men before, is able to recognize my lord's behavior for what it is and remains unimpressed. Jos, however, is easily impressed by the nobility and views my lord's affable attitude as a great honor, demonstrating his lack of experience with such social situations." />

She did not&#10;understand one-half the compliments which he paid; she had never, in&#10;her small experience of mankind, met a professional ladies' man as yet,&#10;and looked upon my lord as something curious rather than pleasant; and&#10;if she did not admire, certainly wondered at him.  Jos, on the&#10;contrary, was delighted. &quot;How very affable his Lordship is,&quot; he said;&#10;&quot;How very kind of his Lordship to say he would send his medical man!&#10;Kirsch, you will carry our cards to the Count de Schlusselback&#10;directly; the Major and I will have the greatest pleasure in paying our&#10;respects at Court as soon as possible.

Yes, he had seen the Right Honourable the Earl of&#10;Bagwig, his lordship's father; he was sure he had, he had met him&#10;at--at the Levee--didn't Dob remember? and when the Diplomatist called&#10;on the party, faithful to his promise, Jos received him with such a&#10;salute and honours as were seldom accorded to the little Envoy.  He&#10;winked at Kirsch on his Excellency's arrival, and that emissary,&#10;instructed before-hand, went out and superintended an entertainment of&#10;cold meats, jellies, and other delicacies, brought in upon trays, and&#10;of which Mr. Jos absolutely insisted that his noble guest should&#10;partake.&#10;&#10;Tapeworm, so long as he could have an opportunity of admiring the&#10;bright eyes of Mrs. Osborne (whose fresh" />

Amelia too laughed. She was in a straw bonnet with&#10;black ribbons, and otherwise dressed in mourning, but the little bustle&#10;and holiday of the journey pleased and excited her, and she looked&#10;particularly happy.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a heavenly day!&quot; Emmy said and added, with great originality, &quot;I&#10;hope we shall have a calm passage.&quot;&#10;&#10;Jos waved his hand, scornfully glancing at the same time under his&#10;eyelids at the great folks opposite.  &quot;If you had made the voyages we&#10;have,&quot; he said, &quot;you wouldn't much care about the weather.&quot; But&#10;nevertheless, traveller as he was, he passed the night direfully sick&#10;in his carriage, where his courier tended him with brandy-and-water" />

On the contrary, his&#10;excitement was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one; he made use of&#10;a brief but improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress,&#10;saying, in fact, &quot;The little minx, has she come to light again?&quot; He&#10;never had had the slightest liking for her, but had heartily mistrusted&#10;her from the very first moment when her green eyes had looked at, and&#10;turned away from, his own.&#10;&#10;" />

During their conversation, Dobbin asks Tapeworm if he knows anything about a certain Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, who had made some noise in London. Tapeworm, who knew all the London gossip and was a relative of Lady Gaunt, proceeds to tell Dobbin an astonishing history about Becky and her husband, Rawdon Crawley. He reveals that Becky had formed odious connections which had estranged her husband's affections from her, and how she had been driven into demanding a separation from her husband. Tapeworm also mentions the Marquis of Steyne, who was a very great and powerful but unprincipled man, and who was connected to Becky's previous life. The revelations made by Tapeworm provide Dobbin with a full and complete version of Becky's private history, including her marriage, her husband's infidelity, and her connections to influential figures in London society." />

As they were discussing that meal, he took occasion to ask&#10;the Secretary whether he knew anything about a certain Mrs. Rawdon&#10;Crawley, who had, he believed, made some noise in London; and then&#10;Tapeworm, who of course knew all the London gossip, and was besides a&#10;relative of Lady Gaunt, poured out into the astonished Major's ears&#10;such a history about Becky and her husband as astonished the querist,&#10;and supplied all the points of this narrative, for it was at that very&#10;table years ago that the present writer had the pleasure of hearing the&#10;tale.  Tufto, Steyne, the Crawleys, and their history--everything&#10;connected with Becky and her previous life passed under the record of&#10;the bitter diplomatist. He knew everything and a great deal besides,&#10;about all the world--in a word, he made the most astounding revelations&#10;to the simple-hearted Major. " />
    <node id="And so the two women continued talking for an hour or more, during&#10;which Becky had the opportunity of giving her new friend a full and&#10;complete version of her private history.

    <node id="Mrs. Bullock, the widow of Mrs. Osborne's brother, is depicted as a scheming and managing character in the narrative. Her primary motivation seems to be mercenary, as she is eager to transfer Mrs. Osborne's account from one house to another, presumably for her own financial gain.&#10;&#10;In addition, Mrs. Bullock is trying to cultivate a relationship between her son and Rosa, Mrs. Osborne's young charge. This behavior is described as &quot;perfectly ridiculous,&quot; suggesting that it is motivated by self-interest rather than genuine concern for the child's well-being. It is possible that Mrs. Bullock sees an advantage in having her son marry a wealthy heiress like Rosa, who stands to inherit a significant fortune from her late father.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mrs. Bullock's scheming and managing behavior appears to be driven by a desire for financial gain and social advancement, rather than any genuine concern for the well-being of those around her." />

Roehampton is not far from Richmond, and one&#10;day the chariot, with the golden bullocks emblazoned on the panels, and&#10;the flaccid children within, drove to Amelia's house at Richmond; and&#10;the Bullock family made an irruption into the garden, where Amelia was&#10;reading a book, Jos was in an arbour placidly dipping strawberries into&#10;wine, and the Major in one of his Indian jackets was giving a back to&#10;Georgy, who chose to jump over him.

She trembles as she runs to meet the ship, and her mind is filled with thoughts of thankfulness. Despite the bad weather, she insists on taking a walk on the Dike with Georgy, eagerly looking out for any sign of William's arrival.

Ah,&#10;poor wretch, when was your lip pressed before by such pure kisses?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Amantium Irae&#10;&#10;Frankness and kindness like Amelia's were likely to touch even such a&#10;hardened little reprobate as Becky.  She returned Emmy's caresses and&#10;kind speeches with something very like gratitude, and an emotion which,&#10;if it was not lasting, for a moment was almost genuine.  That was a&#10;lucky stroke of hers about the child &quot;torn from her arms shrieking.&quot; It&#10;was by that harrowing misfortune that Becky had won her friend back,&#10;and it was one of the very first points, we may be certain, upon which&#10;our poor simple little Emmy began to talk to her new-found acquaintance." />

When it was over, and Georgy had rejoined his&#10;parents, Mrs. Becky returned (just for a few days) to comfort the&#10;solitary bachelor, Joseph Sedley.  He preferred a continental life, he&#10;said, and declined to join in housekeeping with his sister and her&#10;husband.&#10;&#10;Emmy was very glad in her heart to think that she had written to her&#10;husband before she read or knew of that letter of George's.  &quot;I knew it&#10;all along,&quot; William said; &quot;but could I use that weapon against the poor&#10;fellow's memory?

He decided to leave her and end their relationship. The woman is described as a &quot;little tyrant&quot; who wanted to keep William but give nothing in return. After William's departure, the woman is left to enjoy her victory, but it is hinted that she may come to regret her actions due to her lack of faith, love, and character. The passage suggests that the woman may have gone through a period of despair and neglect after her &quot;calamity,&quot; which likely refers to the end of her relationship with William.

In consequence of the fetes the house was&#10;full of company, the tables in the street were already surrounded by&#10;persons smoking and drinking the national small-beer, the public rooms&#10;were in a cloud of smoke, and Mr. Jos having, in his pompous way, and&#10;with his clumsy German, made inquiries for the person of whom he was in&#10;search, was directed to the very top of the house, above the&#10;first-floor rooms where some travelling pedlars had lived, and were&#10;exhibiting their jewellery and brocades; above the second-floor&#10;apartments occupied by the etat major of the gambling firm; above the&#10;third-floor rooms, tenanted by the band of renowned Bohemian vaulters&#10;and tumblers; and so on to the little cabins of the roof, where, among&#10;students, bagmen, small tradesmen," />

I have never parted&#10;with that picture--I never will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Won't you?&quot; Jos cried with a look of unutterable rapture and&#10;satisfaction.  &quot;Did you really now value it for my sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know I did, well enough,&quot; said Becky; &quot;but why speak--why&#10;think--why look back!  It is too late now!&quot;&#10;&#10;That evening's conversation was delicious for Jos. Emmy only came in to&#10;go to bed very tired and unwell. Jos and his fair guest had a charming&#10;tete-a-tete, and his sister could hear, as she lay awake in her&#10;adjoining chamber, Rebecca singing over to Jos the old songs of 1815.&#10;He did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, any more" />

Amelia's followed half&#10;an hour afterwards.  I don't know what made the Major note it so&#10;accurately.&#10;&#10;Jos, however, remained behind over the play-table; he was no gambler,&#10;but not averse to the little excitement of the sport now and then, and&#10;he had some Napoleons chinking in the embroidered pockets of his court&#10;waistcoat.  He put down one over the fair shoulder of the little&#10;gambler before him, and they won.

    <node id="Based on the passage provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the question. There is no &quot;secret understanding&quot; between the Major (Dobbin) and George regarding Becky's manipulations that they are trying to ignore. Instead, both men have had personal interactions with Becky that they have kept hidden from each other. &#10;&#10;George had an affair with Becky, which William learned about but chose not to confront his friend about, either out of hurt, shame, or respect for George's marriage. This is alluded to when George says, &quot;I have been meaning to speak to you away from me... I have not forgotten that disgraceful mystery&quot; on the morning of the Battle of Waterloo.&#10;&#10;William, who has always had reservations about Becky, becomes more suspicious of her motives after hearing about George's relationship with her. Despite suspecting that Becky might be up to her old tricks again, William does not ask George about their past directly. The passage suggests that William may not have inquired further because he was either too hurt or ashamed to bring it up or preferred to maintain his friendship with George by ignoring the issue." />

He and George had often laughed over&#10;it subsequently, and until a few weeks after George's marriage, when he&#10;also was caught in the little Circe's toils, and had an understanding&#10;with her which his comrade certainly suspected, but preferred to&#10;ignore.  William was too much hurt or ashamed to ask to fathom that&#10;disgraceful mystery, although once, and evidently with remorse on his&#10;mind, George had alluded to it.

    <node id="In Vanity Fair, there are certain &quot;unspoken things&quot; that people do and know well, which the narrative compares to the Ahrimanians worshipping the devil without mentioning him. This refers to the hypocrisy and double standards present in society, where people are aware of immoral or harmful behaviors but prefer not to acknowledge them directly.&#10;&#10;Becky, a character with some vices, is presented in a genteel and inoffensive manner because the novel only hints at her wrongdoings without explicitly describing them. The author uses metaphors and allusions to suggest Becky's immoral nature, such as comparing her to a Siren who lures men to their doom. By keeping the most explicit details of her vices under the surface, the novel avoids offending readers' sensibilities while still implying Becky's wickedness.&#10;&#10;For example, when Becky gambles at the table, the narrative describes her movements and emotions in detail but refrains from stating explicitly whether she wins or loses. The focus is on the reactions of other characters and the atmosphere of the scene rather than on the outcome of Becky's gambling. Similarly, when Becky tells her life story to a new friend, she presents herself as a virtuous victim of circumstance, and the narrative does not challenge this self-presentation.&#10;&#10;Overall, the novel presents Becky in a genteel and inoffensive manner by implying rather than stating her vices, allowing readers to form their own conclusions about her character while avoiding explicit descriptions that might offend their sensibilities." />

No!

    <node id="The significant hint about Major Dobbin's accounts as Georgy's guardian that caused old Osborne to reconsider his initial scornful opinion of the Major was discovering that Dobbin had been managing George's ward funds prudently and efficiently. The narrative implies that the accounts showed responsible financial management, which made an impression on the shrewd and business-minded Mr. Osborne. This revelation, coupled with the praise he heard from various members of society about Major Dobbin's reputation and accomplishments, led him to change his opinion of Dobbin and seek reconciliation." />

But he heard of the Major's fame from&#10;various members of his society.  Sir William Dobbin had a great opinion&#10;of his son and narrated many stories illustrative of the Major's&#10;learning, valour, and estimation in the world's opinion. Finally, his&#10;name appeared in the lists of one or two great parties of the nobility,&#10;and this circumstance had a prodigious effect upon the old aristocrat&#10;of Russell Square.&#10;&#10;The Major's position, as guardian to Georgy, whose possession had been&#10;ceded to his grandfather, rendered some meetings between the two&#10;gentlemen inevitable; and it was in one of these that old Osborne, a&#10;keen man of business, looking into the Major's accounts with his ward&#10;and the boy's mother, got a hint, which staggered him very much, and at" />

The father boasted about him according to his wont,&#10;glorifying himself in recounting his son's feats and gallantry, but his&#10;mood was at any rate better and more charitable than that in which he&#10;had been disposed until now to regard the poor fellow; and the&#10;Christian heart of the kind Major was pleased at these symptoms of&#10;returning peace and good-will.  On the second evening old Osborne&#10;called Dobbin William, just as he used to do at the time when Dobbin&#10;and George were boys together, and the honest gentleman was pleased by&#10;that mark of reconciliation.&#10;&#10;On the next day at breakfast, when Miss Osborne, with the asperity of&#10;her age and character, ventured to make some remark reflecting&#10;slightingly upon the Major's appearance or behaviour--the master of the&#10;house interrupted her.

He also leaves his and Major Dobbin's cards at &quot;Our Minister&quot; whenever they stop, indicating a desire to make connections with influential people.

This encounter reminds Becky of her connections to powerful figures in London society, which makes her feel superior to those around her.&#10;&#10;Second, Becky starts developing romantic feelings for Lord Steyne, a high-ranking nobleman. She becomes preoccupied with him and pays less attention to the people around her, causing her to seem aloof and haughty.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Becky's perception of herself as superior to others is reinforced by the way the men around her start behaving differently. Grinstone shows a familiarity that makes her uncomfortable, and Little Bob Suckling ignores her completely. This change in behavior indicates that Becky's charm and influence over these men are waning, which further isolates her and makes her feel unwanted.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Becky's change in behavior and perception during the gathering is caused by her romantic feelings for Lord Steyne, her sense of superiority due to her connections to powerful figures, and the way the men around her start behaving differently, which contributes to her feeling isolated and unwanted." />

He asked little parties&#10;and invented festivities to do her honour.&#10;&#10;Tapeworm, the Charge d'Affaires, who had abused her so cruelly, came to&#10;dine with Jos, and then came every day to pay his respects to Becky.&#10;Poor Emmy, who was never very talkative, and more glum and silent than&#10;ever after Dobbin's departure, was quite forgotten when this superior&#10;genius made her appearance.

Old Sedley's lingering&#10;illness and death supervened, after which a meeting was for some time&#10;impossible.  That catastrophe and other events may have worked upon Mr.&#10;Osborne.  He was much shaken of late, and aged, and his mind was&#10;working inwardly.  He had sent for his lawyers, and probably changed&#10;something in his will.

    <node id="William Dobbin and George Osborne formed their close friendship during their early military days. Dobbin's genuine kindness, dependability, and gallantry made a lasting impression on the young George. Over time, Dobbin became George's protector, confidant, and the person George's father trusted the most.&#10;&#10;This friendship had a significant impact on Georgy's view of Dobbin. After his father's death, Georgy grew up hearing stories about Dobbin's heroism, loyalty, and devotion to his father. As a result, Georgy developed a deep admiration for Dobbin and considered him not only a role model but also a true friend.&#10;&#10;The strong bond between Dobbin and George Osborne was further emphasized when Dobbin became Georgy's guardian and continued to look after the interests of both Georgy and his mother, Amelia. This selfless act reinforced Georgy's positive opinion of Dobbin and strengthened their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, William Dobbin and George Osborne formed a close friendship due to Dobbin's admirable qualities and consistent support for George. This friendship significantly influenced Georgy's perception of Dobbin, shaping him into a role model, friend, and guardian in Georgy's eyes." />

I, as a young man in those&#10;days, was flattered beyond measure by his preference for me, and was&#10;more pleased to be seen in his company than in that of the&#10;Commander-in-Chief.

She quivered with indignation at the account of the conduct of&#10;the miserable Rawdon and the unprincipled Steyne.  Her eyes made notes&#10;of admiration for every one of the sentences in which Becky described&#10;the persecutions of her aristocratic relatives and the falling away of&#10;her husband.

The reason for her losing all her money is not explicitly stated in the narrative; it could be due to the inherent unpredictability and risk involved in gambling or simply bad luck.

It was strange&#10;to look at her.&#10;&#10;But in spite of her care and assiduity she guessed wrong and the last&#10;two florins followed each other under the croupier's rake, as he cried&#10;out with his inexorable voice the winning colour and number.  She gave&#10;a sigh, a shrug with her shoulders, which were already too much out of&#10;her gown, and dashing the pin through the card on to the table, sat&#10;thrumming it for a while.

Other people, finding the entertainment stupid and&#10;preferring the fun at the Stadthaus, had quitted the Palace ball&#10;earlier; but it is probable the Major and Jos had gone home and found&#10;the boy's absence, for the former instantly went up to him and, taking&#10;him by the shoulder, pulled him briskly back from the place of&#10;temptation.  Then, looking round the room, he saw Kirsch employed as we&#10;have said, and going up to him, asked how he dared to bring Mr. George&#10;to such a place.&#10;&#10;&quot;Laissez-moi tranquille,&quot; said Mr. Kirsch, very much excited by play&#10;and wine.  &quot;Il faut s'amuser, parbleu.

    <node id="1. William Sedley (also known as Major Dobbin) tried to convince Joseph Sedley (Jos) to keep Rebecca out of his household by using strong language, urging Jos with great energy and eloquence. He pointed out Rebecca's past misdeeds, such as leading George Osborne into ruin along with her husband Crawley, and how she was now separated from her spouse. Dobbin highlighted the potential dangers of having Rebecca around Jos's sister, who lacked worldly knowledge.&#10;2. Jos did not accept Dobbin's plea mainly because of his jealousy towards Dobbin's air of superiority, which he felt was constantly exhibited by the Major. Additionally, Jos feared a confrontation with Rebecca in his home and wanted to avoid any negative talk about her. He claimed that Rebecca was an unfortunate woman whose husband had abandoned her and asked Amelia for help despite their strained relationship.&#10;3. Jos also described Rebecca as someone who had been giving singing lessons to earn a living, emphasizing her fidelity in caring for him through various illnesses and praising her admirable qualities. This portrayal of Rebecca contradicted Dobbin's warnings, making it difficult for Jos to be swayed by his arguments.&#10;&#10;In summary, William Sedley implored Jos not to let Rebecca into his household using strong language and pointing out her past misdeeds. However, Jos was not convinced due to his jealousy towards Dobbin and his belief that Rebecca deserved help despite their strained relationship." />

What a dangerous companion she would be for&#10;his sister, who knew nothing of the affairs of the world!  William&#10;implored Jos, with all the eloquence which he could bring to bear, and&#10;a great deal more energy than this quiet gentleman was ordinarily in&#10;the habit of showing, to keep Rebecca out of his household.&#10;&#10;Had he been less violent, or more dexterous, he might have succeeded in&#10;his supplications to Jos; but the civilian was not a little jealous of&#10;the airs of superiority which the Major constantly exhibited towards&#10;him, as he fancied (indeed, he had imparted his opinions to Mr. Kirsch,&#10;the courier, whose bills Major Dobbin checked on this journey, and who&#10;sided with his master), and he began a blustering speech about his&#10;comp" />
    <node id="The text suggests that the dying Mr. Osborne's final wish was to see his daughter Amelia and be reconciled before he passed away. This is implied when the narrator states &quot;it was most likely that, for his will showed that the hatred which he had so long cherished had gone out of his heart.&quot; The fact that Mr. Osborne tries to speak and asks about Amelia specifically supports this interpretation.&#10;&#10;This desire to reconcile with Amelia is significant in relation to the contents of the letter with the great red seal found in his dressing gown because it suggests that Mr. Osborne may have wanted to make amends with Amelia before he died, possibly by apologizing for his past behavior or expressing his regret at their falling out. The fact that he keeps this letter from George and reads the family Bible, which contains information about his loved ones, also supports this interpretation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the contents of the will suggest that Mr. Osborne had a change of heart towards the end of his life. He leaves half of his property to George and the remainder between the two sisters, rather than leaving it all to his surviving son or disinheriting Amelia as he had previously threatened to do. This change in the distribution of his wealth suggests that Mr. Osborne may have forgiven Amelia and wanted to make amends with her before he died." />
    <node id="1. Desire for Financial Gain: Mrs. Bullock is depicted as a mercenary character who is eager to transfer Mrs. Osborne's account from one house to another, presumably for her own financial gain. This behavior suggests that she sees an opportunity to benefit financially by managing Mrs. Osborne's account.&#10;&#10;2. Social Advancement: In addition to financial gains, Mrs. Bullock is also motivated by social advancement. She tries to cultivate a relationship between her son and Rosa, Mrs. Osborne's young charge, possibly with the intention of securing a wealthy match for her son. This behavior indicates that she perceives an advantage in having her son marry a wealthy heiress like Rosa, who stands to inherit a significant fortune from her late father.&#10;&#10;3. Coaxing a Boy to Sit by Rosa: Mrs. Bullock's attempts to coax a boy to sit by Rosa can be seen as part of her efforts to secure a match between her son and the girl. By encouraging their interaction, she hopes to foster a bond between them and increase the likelihood of a future union.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Bullock's scheming and managing behavior appears to be driven by a desire for financial gain and social advancement, rather than any genuine concern for the well-being of those around her." />

Desire for Financial Gain: Mrs. Bullock is depicted as a mercenary character who is eager to transfer Mrs. Osborne's account from one house to another, presumably for her own financial gain. This behavior suggests that she sees an opportunity to benefit financially by managing Mrs. Osborne's account.&#10;&#10;2. Social Advancement: In addition to financial gains, Mrs. Bullock is also motivated by social advancement. She tries to cultivate a relationship between her son and Rosa, Mrs. Osborne's young charge, possibly with the intention of securing a wealthy match for her son. This behavior indicates that she perceives an advantage in having her son marry a wealthy heiress like Rosa, who stands to inherit a significant fortune from her late father.&#10;&#10;3. Coaxing a Boy to Sit by Rosa: Mrs. Bullock's attempts to coax a boy to sit by Rosa can be seen as part of her efforts to secure a match between her son and the girl. By encouraging their interaction, she hopes to foster a bond between them and increase the likelihood of a future union.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Bullock's scheming and managing behavior appears to be driven by a desire for financial gain and social advancement, rather than any genuine concern for the well-being of those around her.">

This refers to the hypocrisy and double standards present in society, where people are aware of immoral or harmful behaviors but prefer not to acknowledge them directly.&#10;&#10;Becky, a character with some vices, is presented in a genteel and inoffensive manner because the novel only hints at her wrongdoings without explicitly describing them. The author uses metaphors and allusions to suggest Becky's immoral nature, such as comparing her to a Siren who lures men to their doom. By keeping the most explicit details of her vices under the surface, the novel avoids offending readers' sensibilities while still implying Becky's wickedness.&#10;&#10;For example, when Becky gambles at the table, the narrative describes her movements and emotions in detail but refrains from stating explicitly whether she wins or loses. The focus is on the reactions of other characters and the atmosphere of the scene rather than on the outcome of Becky's gambling. Similarly, when Becky tells her life story to a new friend, she presents herself as a virtuous victim of circumstance, and the narrative does not challenge this self-presentation.&#10;&#10;Overall, the novel presents Becky in a genteel and inoffensive manner by implying rather than stating her vices, allowing readers to form their own conclusions about her character while avoiding explicit descriptions that might offend their sensibilities.">

This refers to the hypocrisy and double standards present in society, where people are aware of immoral or harmful behaviors but prefer not to acknowledge them directly.&#10;&#10;Becky, a character with some vices, is presented in a genteel and inoffensive manner because the novel only hints at her wrongdoings without explicitly describing them. The author uses metaphors and allusions to suggest Becky's immoral nature, such as comparing her to a Siren who lures men to their doom. By keeping the most explicit details of her vices under the surface, the novel avoids offending readers' sensibilities while still implying Becky's wickedness.&#10;&#10;For example, when Becky gambles at the table, the narrative describes her movements and emotions in detail but refrains from stating explicitly whether she wins or loses. The focus is on the reactions of other characters and the atmosphere of the scene rather than on the outcome of Becky's gambling. Similarly, when Becky tells her life story to a new friend, she presents herself as a virtuous victim of circumstance, and the narrative does not challenge this self-presentation.&#10;&#10;Overall, the novel presents Becky in a genteel and inoffensive manner by implying rather than stating her vices, allowing readers to form their own conclusions about her character while avoiding explicit descriptions that might offend their sensibilities.">

This is alluded to when George says, &quot;I have been meaning to speak to you away from me... I have not forgotten that disgraceful mystery&quot; on the morning of the Battle of Waterloo.&#10;&#10;William, who has always had reservations about Becky, becomes more suspicious of her motives after hearing about George's relationship with her. Despite suspecting that Becky might be up to her old tricks again, William does not ask George about their past directly.

Mrs. Bullock is depicted as a scheming and managing character in the narrative, primarily motivated by mercenary gains and social advancement." target="1. Desire for Financial Gain: Mrs. Bullock is depicted as a mercenary character who is eager to transfer Mrs. Osborne's account from one house to another, presumably for her own financial gain. This behavior suggests that she sees an opportunity to benefit financially by managing Mrs. Osborne's account.&#10;&#10;2. Social Advancement: In addition to financial gains, Mrs. Bullock is also motivated by social advancement. She tries to cultivate a relationship between her son and Rosa, Mrs. Osborne's young charge, possibly with the intention of securing a wealthy match for her son. This behavior indicates that she perceives an advantage in having her son marry a wealthy heiress like Rosa, who stands to inherit a significant fortune from her late father.&#10;&#10;3. Coaxing a Boy to Sit by Rosa: Mrs. Bullock's attempts to coax a boy to sit by Rosa can be seen as part of her efforts to secure a match between her son and the girl. By encouraging their interaction, she hopes to foster a bond between them and increase the likelihood of a future union.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Bullock's scheming and managing behavior appears to be driven by a desire for financial gain and social advancement, rather than any genuine concern for the well-being of those around her.">

The fact that he keeps this letter from George and reads the family Bible, which contains information about his loved ones, also supports this interpretation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the contents of the will suggest that Mr. Osborne had a change of heart towards the end of his life.

He pointed out Rebecca's past misdeeds, such as leading George Osborne into ruin along with her husband Crawley, and how she was now separated from her spouse. Dobbin highlighted the potential dangers of having Rebecca around Jos's sister, who lacked worldly knowledge.&#10;2. Jos did not accept Dobbin's plea mainly because of his jealousy towards Dobbin's air of superiority, which he felt was constantly exhibited by the Major. Additionally, Jos feared a confrontation with Rebecca in his home and wanted to avoid any negative talk about her. He claimed that Rebecca was an unfortunate woman whose husband had abandoned her and asked Amelia for help despite their strained relationship.&#10;3.

Finally, his&#10;name appeared in the lists of one or two great parties of the nobility,&#10;and this circumstance had a prodigious effect upon the old aristocrat&#10;of Russell Square.&#10;&#10;The Major's position, as guardian to Georgy, whose possession had been&#10;ceded to his grandfather, rendered some meetings between the two&#10;gentlemen inevitable; and it was in one of these that old Osborne, a&#10;keen man of business, looking into the Major's accounts with his ward&#10;and the boy's mother, got a hint, which staggered him very much, and at" target="William Dobbin and George Osborne formed their close friendship during their early military days. Dobbin's genuine kindness, dependability, and gallantry made a lasting impression on the young George. Over time, Dobbin became George's protector, confidant, and the person George's father trusted the most.&#10;&#10;This friendship had a significant impact on Georgy's view of Dobbin. After his father's death, Georgy grew up hearing stories about Dobbin's heroism, loyalty, and devotion to his father. As a result, Georgy developed a deep admiration for Dobbin and considered him not only a role model but also a true friend.&#10;&#10;The strong bond between Dobbin and George Osborne was further emphasized when Dobbin became Georgy's guardian and continued to look after the interests of both Georgy and his mother, Amelia. This selfless act reinforced Georgy's positive opinion of Dobbin and strengthened their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, William Dobbin and George Osborne formed a close friendship due to Dobbin's admirable qualities and consistent support for George. This friendship significantly influenced Georgy's perception of Dobbin, shaping him into a role model, friend, and guardian in Georgy's eyes.">

Mrs. Crawley, who had her carriage, gave entertainments,&#10;and lived in a very genteel manner, occupied another suite of&#10;apartments in the same hotel.&#10;&#10;The Colonel, of course, did not desire to see that lady, or even think&#10;proper to notify his arrival at Brussels, except privately to Jos by a&#10;message through his valet.  Jos begged the Colonel to come and see him&#10;that night, when Mrs. Crawley would be at a soiree, and when they could&#10;meet alone.  He found his brother-in-law in a condition of pitiable&#10;infirmity--and dreadfully afraid of Rebecca, though eager in his&#10;praises of her.  She tended him through a series of unheard-of&#10;illnesses with a fidelity most admirable.  She had been a daughter to&#10;him.  &quot;But--but--oh, for God's sake, do come and live near me,&#10;and--and--see me sometimes,&quot; whimpered out the unfortunate man.&#10;&#10;The Colonel's" target="1. William Sedley (also known as Major Dobbin) tried to convince Joseph Sedley (Jos) to keep Rebecca out of his household by using strong language, urging Jos with great energy and eloquence. He pointed out Rebecca's past misdeeds, such as leading George Osborne into ruin along with her husband Crawley, and how she was now separated from her spouse. Dobbin highlighted the potential dangers of having Rebecca around Jos's sister, who lacked worldly knowledge.&#10;2. Jos did not accept Dobbin's plea mainly because of his jealousy towards Dobbin's air of superiority, which he felt was constantly exhibited by the Major. Additionally, Jos feared a confrontation with Rebecca in his home and wanted to avoid any negative talk about her. He claimed that Rebecca was an unfortunate woman whose husband had abandoned her and asked Amelia for help despite their strained relationship.&#10;3. Jos also described Rebecca as someone who had been giving singing lessons to earn a living, emphasizing her fidelity in caring for him through various illnesses and praising her admirable qualities. This portrayal of Rebecca contradicted Dobbin's warnings, making it difficult for Jos to be swayed by his arguments.&#10;&#10;In summary, William Sedley implored Jos not to let Rebecca into his household using strong language and pointing out her past misdeeds. However, Jos was not convinced due to his jealousy towards Dobbin and his belief that Rebecca deserved help despite their strained relationship.">

The fact that he keeps this letter from George and reads the family Bible, which contains information about his loved ones, also supports this interpretation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the contents of the will suggest that Mr. Osborne had a change of heart towards the end of his life. He leaves half of his property to George and the remainder between the two sisters, rather than leaving it all to his surviving son or disinheriting Amelia as he had previously threatened to do. This change in the distribution of his wealth suggests that Mr. Osborne may have forgiven Amelia and wanted to make amends with her before he died.">

This selfless act reinforced Georgy's positive opinion of Dobbin and strengthened their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, William Dobbin and George Osborne formed a close friendship due to Dobbin's admirable qualities and consistent support for George.

    <node id="1. Wah-ta-Wah, a captive along with Hetty, observes the interactions between Hetty, her father (Mr. Hutter), and Hurry in the Iroquois encampment.&#10;&#10;2. Hetty and Wah-ta-Wah approach the encampment, and Hetty is surprised to find her father and Hurry &quot;at liberty&quot; among the others, appearing as visitors rather than captives.&#10;&#10;3. Hetty requests that Wah-ta-Wah convey a message to the chiefs, revealing the original intent of her father and Hurry to take scalps for bounty. This revelation has no visible effect on the listeners, who likely consider it meritorious.&#10;&#10;4. Upon hearing about Judith's plan to break open a chest to buy their freedom, Mr. Hutter disapproves, fearing that the Iroquois have other plans in motion. He expresses concern over counting on Wah-ta-Wah's help with their escape.&#10;&#10;5. Hist (Hetty) explains that she attempted to capture one of the Indians who arrived but was quickly overwhelmed by a group of them, and assures her father they are innocent of taking any scalps in this encounter.&#10;&#10;6. Hetty expresses relief upon hearing her father didn't succeed in his mission, allowing her to speak to the Iroquois with a clear conscience. Hurry confirms that their group was caught off-guard by an unexpected Indian attack but managed to escape harm.&#10;&#10;7. Wah-ta-Wah accurately conveys Hetty's message to the chiefs in the Iroquois language, and they listen with grave decorum, acknowledging her translation with subtle gestures of approval." />

As for the men, they&#10;either ate, slept, or examined their arms. They conversed but little,&#10;and then usually apart, or in groups withdrawn from the females, whilst&#10;an air of untiring, innate watchfulness and apprehension of danger&#10;seemed to be blended even with their slumbers.&#10;&#10;As the two girls came near the encampment, Hetty uttered a slight&#10;exclamation, on catching a view of the person of her father. He was&#10;seated on the ground with his back to a tree, and Hurry stood near him&#10;indolently whittling a twig. Apparently they were as much at liberty as&#10;any others in or about the camp, and one unaccustomed to Indian usages&#10;would have mistaken them for visitors, instead of supposing them to&#10;be captives. Wah-ta-Wah led her new friend quite near them, and then&#10;modestly withdrew, that her own presence might be no restraint on her&#10;feelings. But Hetty" />

Tell them this,&#10;dear Hist, just as you have heard it from me, word for word.&quot;&#10;&#10;Wah-ta-Wah hesitated about rendering this speech as literally as had&#10;been desired, but detecting the intelligence of those who understood&#10;English, and apprehending even a greater knowledge than they actually&#10;possessed she found herself compelled to comply. Contrary to what a&#10;civilized man would have expected, the admission of the motives and of&#10;the errands of their prisoners produced no visible effect on either the&#10;countenances or the feelings of the listeners. They probably considered&#10;the act meritorious, and that which neither of them would have hesitated&#10;to perform in his own person, he would not be apt to censure in another.&#10;&#10;&quot;And, now, Hist,&quot; resumed Hetty, as soon as she perceived that her first&#10;speeches were understood by the chiefs, &quot;you can tell them more. They&#10;know that father and Hurry did not succeed, and therefore they can bear&#10;them no grudge for any harm that has been done. If they had slain their&#10;children and wives it would not alter the matter, and I'm not certain&#10;that" />
    <node id=" Hetty, &quot;Judith thinks of breaking open the big chest,&#10;in hopes of finding something in that which may buy your freedom of the&#10;savages.&quot;&#10;&#10;A dark look came over Hutter at the announcement of this fact, and he&#10;muttered his dissatisfaction in a way to render it intelligible enough.&#10;&#10;&quot;What for no break open chest?&quot; put in Hist. &quot;Life sweeter than old&#10;chest--scalp sweeter than old chest. If no tell darter to break him&#10;open, Wah-ta-Wah no help him to run away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ye know not what ye ask--ye are but silly girls, and the wisest way for&#10;ye both is to speak of what ye understand and to speak of nothing else.&#10;I little like this cold neglect of the savages, Hurry; it's a proof that&#10;they think of something serious, and if we are to do any thing, we must&#10;do it soon. Can we count on this young woman, think you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen--&quot; said Hist quickly, and with an earnestness that proved how&#10;much her feelings were concerned--&quot;Wah-ta-Wah no Iroquois--All" />
    <node id=", child, I can answer you, no. I had&#10;caught the young creatur' who came here with you, but her screeches soon&#10;brought down upon me a troop of the wild cats, that was too much for any&#10;single Christian to withstand. If that will do you any good, we are as&#10;innocent of having taken a scalp, this time, as I make no doubt we shall&#10;also be innocent of receiving the bounty.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank God for that, father! Now I can speak boldly to the Iroquois, and&#10;with an easy conscience. I hope Hurry, too, has not been able to harm&#10;any of the Indians?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, as to that matter, Hetty,&quot; returned the individual in question,&#10;&quot;you've put it pretty much in the natyve character of the religious&#10;truth. Hurry has not been able, and that is the long and short of it.&#10;I've seen many squalls, old fellow, both on land and on the water, but&#10;never did I feel one as lively and as snappish as that which come down&#10;upon us, night afore last, in the shape of an Indian hurrah-boys!" />
    <node id=" or me.&#10;God will protect us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Wah-ta-Wah did as the other desired, taking care to render the words of&#10;her friend as literally as possible into the Iroquois tongue, a language&#10;she used with a readiness almost equal to that with which she spoke her&#10;own. The chiefs heard this opening explanation with grave decorum, the&#10;two who had a little knowledge of English intimating their satisfaction&#10;with the interpreter by furtive but significant glances of the eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;And, now, Hist,&quot; continued Hetty, as soon as it was intimated to her&#10;that she might proceed, &quot;and, now, Hist, I wish you to tell these red&#10;men, word for word, what I am about to say. Tell them first, that father&#10;and Hurry came here with an intention to take as many scalps as they&#10;could, for the wicked governor and the province have offered money for&#10;scalps, whether of warriors, or women, men or children, and the love of&#10;gold was too strong for their hearts to withstand it. Tell them this,&#10;dear Hist, just as you have heard it from me, word for word.&quot;&#10;&#10;W" />
    <node id=" Then&#10;he knew the simple, single-hearted fidelity of his child, and understood&#10;why she had come, and the total disregard of self that reigned in all&#10;her acts.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is not well, Hetty,&quot; he said, deprecating the consequences to the&#10;girl herself more than any other evil. &quot;These are fierce Iroquois, and&#10;are as little apt to forget an injury, as a favor.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me, father--&quot; returned the girl, looking furtively about her as&#10;if fearful of being overheard, &quot;did God let you do the cruel errand&#10;on which you came? I want much to know this, that I may speak to the&#10;Indians plainly, if he did not.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You should not have come hither, Hetty; these brutes will not&#10;understand your nature or your intentions!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How was it, father; neither you nor Hurry seems to have any thing that&#10;looks like scalps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If that will set your mind at peace, child, I can answer you, no. I had&#10;caught the young creatur' who came here with you, but her screeches soon&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Hetty explains why Indians don't have a sacred book from God by saying that it's because they don't know how to read. This explanation suggests that she sees literacy as a prerequisite for receiving divine revelation, and it reflects the colonial perspective of her upbringing.&#10;2. Hist, the Native American girl, tries to convey the teachings of forgiveness and kindness from Hetty's sacred volume to her fellow chiefs. She faces difficulty in communicating these abstract ideas because they are not easily translated or understood within the cultural framework of her people.&#10;3. The passage highlights a major challenge in intercultural communication and understanding. Hist struggles to explain the concept of forgiveness and kindness from Hetty's perspective, while Hetty grapples with comprehending the contradiction between the teachings of the sacred volume and the actions of those who possess it." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;This is the sacred volume, Hist,&quot; she said--&quot;and these words, and&#10;lines, and verses, and chapters, all came from God.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why Great Spirit no send book to Injin, too?&quot; demanded Hist, with the&#10;directness of a mind that was totally unsophisticated.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot; answered Hetty, a little bewildered by a question so unexpected.&#10;&quot;Why?--Ah! you know the Indians don't know how to read.&quot;&#10;&#10;If Hist was not satisfied with this explanation, she did not deem the&#10;point of sufficient importance to be pressed. Simply bending her body,&#10;in a gentle admission of the truth of what she heard, she sat patiently&#10;awaiting the further arguments of the pale-face enthusiast.&#10;&#10;&quot;You can tell these chiefs that throughout this book, men are ordered to&#10;forgive their enemies; to treat them as they would brethren; and never&#10;to injure their fellow creatures, more especially on account of revenge&#10;or any evil passions. Do you think you can tell them this, so that they&#10;will understand it, Hist?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him well enough, but he no very easy to understand.&quot; Hist then&#10;convey" />
    <node id=" and pleasure, and the rules by which all&#10;men are to live, and directions how to govern the thoughts even, and&#10;the wishes, and the will. Here, this is one of these holy books, and&#10;you must tell the chiefs what I am about to read to them from its sacred&#10;pages.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Hetty concluded, she reverently unrolled a small English Bible from&#10;its envelope of coarse calico, treating the volume with the sort of&#10;external respect that a Romanist would be apt to show to a religious&#10;relic. As she slowly proceeded in her task the grim warriors watched&#10;each movement with riveted eyes, and when they saw the little volume&#10;appear a slight expression of surprise escaped one or two of them. But&#10;Hetty held it out towards them in triumph, as if she expected the sight&#10;would produce a visible miracle, and then, without betraying either&#10;surprise or mortification at the Stoicism of the Indian, she turned&#10;eagerly to her new friend, in order to renew the discourse.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is the sacred volume, Hist,&quot; she said--&quot;and these words, and&#10;lines, and verses, and chapters, all came from God" />
    <node id=" listen,&quot; said Hist.&#10;&#10;&quot;I rejoice to hear it!&quot; exclaimed Hetty. &quot;God has touched his heart, and&#10;he will now let father and Hurry go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is the pale-face law,&quot; resumed the chief. &quot;It tells him to do good&#10;to them that hurt him, and when his brother asks him for his rifle to&#10;give him the powder horn, too. Such is the pale-face law?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not so--not so--&quot; answered Hetty earnestly, when these words had been&#10;interpreted--&quot;There is not a word about rifles in the whole book, and&#10;powder and bullets give offence to the Great Spirit.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why then does the pale-face use them? If he is ordered to give double&#10;to him that asks only for one thing, why does he take double from the&#10;poor Indian who ask for no thing. He comes from beyond the rising sun,&#10;with this book in his hand, and he teaches the red man to read it, but&#10;why does he forget himself all it says? When the Indian gives, he is&#10;never satisfied; and now he offers gold for the scalps of our women and&#10;children, though" />
    <node id=", so that they&#10;will understand it, Hist?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him well enough, but he no very easy to understand.&quot; Hist then&#10;conveyed the ideas of Hetty, in the best manner she could, to the&#10;attentive Indians, who heard her words with some such surprise as an&#10;American of our own times would be apt to betray at a suggestion that&#10;the great modern but vacillating ruler of things human, public opinion,&#10;might be wrong. One or two of their number, however, having met with&#10;missionaries, said a few words in explanation, and then the group gave&#10;all its attention to the communications that were to follow. Before&#10;Hetty resumed she inquired earnestly of Hist if the chiefs had&#10;understood her, and receiving an evasive answer, was fain to be&#10;satisfied.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will now read to the warriors some of the verses that it is good for&#10;them to know,&quot; continued the girl, whose manner grew more solemn and&#10;earnest as she proceeded--&quot;and they will remember that they are the very&#10;words of the Great Spirit. First, then, ye are commanded to 'love thy&#10;neighbor as Thyself" />
    <node id=" all it says? When the Indian gives, he is&#10;never satisfied; and now he offers gold for the scalps of our women and&#10;children, though he calls us beasts if we take the scalp of a warrior&#10;killed in open war. My name is Rivenoak.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Hetty had got this formidable question fairly presented to her mind&#10;in the translation, and Hist did her duty with more than usual&#10;readiness on this occasion, it scarcely need be said that she was sorely&#10;perplexed. Abler heads than that of this poor girl have frequently been&#10;puzzled by questions of a similar drift, and it is not surprising that&#10;with all her own earnestness and sincerity she did not know what answer&#10;to make.&#10;&#10;&quot;What shall I tell them, Hist,&quot; she asked imploringly--&quot;I know that all&#10;I have read from the book is true, and yet it wouldn't seem so, would&#10;it, by the conduct of those to whom the book was given?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Give 'em pale-face reason,&quot; returned Hist, ironically--&quot;that always&#10;good for one side; though he bad for t'other.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--no--Hist, there can" />
    <node id=" the afflicted girl, she attempted&#10;to soothe her sorrows by the scarcely ever failing remedy of female&#10;sympathy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop cry--no cry--&quot; she said, wiping the tears from the face of Hetty,&#10;as she would have performed the same office for a child, and stopping&#10;to press her occasionally to her own warm bosom with the affection of&#10;a sister. &quot;Why you so trouble? You no make he book, if he be wrong, and&#10;you no make he pale-face if he wicked. There wicked red man, and wicked&#10;white man--no colour all good--no colour all wicked. Chiefs know that&#10;well enough.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty soon recovered from this sudden burst of grief, and then her&#10;mind reverted to the purpose of her visit, with all its single-hearted&#10;earnestness. Perceiving that the grim looking chiefs were still standing&#10;around her in grave attention, she hoped that another effort to convince&#10;them of the right might be successful. &quot;Listen, Hist,&quot; she said,&#10;struggling to suppress her sobs, and to speak distinctly--&quot;Tell the&#10;chiefs that it matters not what the wicked do--right is right" />
    <node id="Deerslayer is questioning Judith's willingness and ability to part with her fine clothes to help the women of the Iroquois. He compares it to the behavior of men in dangerous situations because he believes that people often have different reactions when faced with real danger, as opposed to when they are only thinking or talking about it hypothetically. Deerslayer implies that Judith's love for finery might prevent her from making a sacrifice that could potentially help her father and sister in their dire situation.&#10;&#10;The passage also reveals Deerslayer's appreciation for Chingachgook's quick-wittedness when the latter suggests hiding the key to the strongbox among Hetty's coarse clothes, as he knows Judith would be unlikely to search there. The comparison between men and women in this situation highlights the gendered expectations of their roles: Deerslayer assumes that Judith might not be willing to part with her fine clothes due to her femininity, while Chingachgook's suggestion demonstrates his practicality and readiness for action.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer questions Judith's ability to part with her clothes because he thinks it will be challenging for her due to her love for finery, comparing it to the behavior of men in dangerous situations to emphasize the difference between talk and real-life actions." />
    <node id=". Judith showed by her looks&#10;that she had passed an unquiet night, while the two men had the future&#10;before them, with its unseen and unknown events. A few words of courtesy&#10;passed between Deerslayer and the girl, in the course of the breakfast,&#10;but no allusion was made to their situation. At length Judith, whose&#10;heart was full, and whose novel feelings disposed her to entertain&#10;sentiments more gentle and tender than common, introduced the subject,&#10;and this in a way to show how much of her thoughts it had occupied, in&#10;the course of the last sleepless night.&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be dreadful, Deerslayer,&quot; the girl abruptly exclaimed, &quot;should&#10;anything serious befall my father and Hetty! We cannot remain quietly&#10;here and leave them in the hands of the Iroquois, without bethinking us&#10;of some means of serving them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm ready, Judith, to sarve them, and all others who are in trouble,&#10;could the way to do it be p'inted out. It's no trifling matter to fall&#10;into red-skin hands, when men set out on an ar'n'd like that which took&#10;H" />
    <node id=" said, &quot;and all men have&#10;a right to their enj'yment. We've got low enough in this chist in my&#10;judgment to answer our wants, and it seems to me we should do well by&#10;going no farther; and by letting Master Hutter have to himself, and his&#10;own feelin's, all that's beneath this cover.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you mean, Deerslayer, to offer these clothes to the Iroquois as&#10;ransom?&quot; demanded Judith, quickly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sartain. What are we prying into another man's chist for, but to sarve&#10;its owner in the best way we can. This coat, alone, would be very apt&#10;to gain over the head chief of the riptyles, and if his wife or darter&#10;should happen to be out with him, that there gownd would soften the&#10;heart of any woman that is to be found atween Albany and Montreal. I do&#10;not see that we want a larger stock in trade than them two articles.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To you it may seem so, Deerslayer,&quot; returned the disappointed girl,&#10;&quot;but of what use could a dress like this be to any Indian" />
    <node id=" the Wild Rose?&quot; for so Chingachgook&#10;had begun gallantly to term Judith, in his private discourse with his&#10;friend.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's it! That's just it! One he trusts, and the other he doesn't.&#10;There's red and white in that, Sarpent, all tribes and nations agreeing&#10;in trusting some, and refusing to trust other some. It depends on&#10;character and judgment.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where could a key be put, so little likely to be found by the Wild&#10;Rose, as among coarse clothes?&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer started, and turning to his friend with admiration expressed&#10;in every lineament of his face, he fairly laughed, in his silent but&#10;hearty manner, at the ingenuity and readiness of the conjecture.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your name's well bestowed, Sarpent--yes, 'tis well bestowed! Sure&#10;enough, where would a lover of finery be so little likely to s'arch, as&#10;among garments as coarse and onseemly as these of poor Hetty's. I dares&#10;to say, Judith's delicate fingers haven't touched a bit of cloth&#10;as rough and oncomely as that petticoat, now" />
    <node id=" men are not the&#10;expartest in fire arms, and don't always know the difference atwixt that&#10;which is ra'al, and that which is seeming.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is horrible!&quot; muttered the girl, struck by the homely manner in&#10;which her companion was accustomed to state his facts. &quot;But you overlook&#10;my own clothes, Deerslayer, and they, I think, might go far with the&#10;women of the Iroquois.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No doubt they would; no doubt they would, Judith,&quot; returned the other,&#10;looking at her keenly, as if he would ascertain whether she were really&#10;capable of making such a sacrifice. &quot;But, are you sartain, gal, you&#10;could find it in your heart to part with your own finery for such a&#10;purpose? Many is the man who has thought he was valiant till danger&#10;stared him in the face; I've known them, too, that consaited they were&#10;kind and ready to give away all they had to the poor, when they've&#10;been listening to other people's hard heartedness; but whose fists&#10;have clench'd as tight as the riven hickory when it came to" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Father,&quot; she said, &quot;neither Deerslayer nor Judith knew of my coming&#10;until I had left the Ark. They are afraid the Iroquois will make a raft&#10;and try to get off to the hut, and think more of defending that than of&#10;coming to aid you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--no--no--&quot; said Hist hurriedly, though in a low voice, and with her&#10;face bent towards the earth, in order to conceal from those whom&#10;she knew to be watching them the fact of her speaking at all.&#10;&quot;No--no--no--Deerslayer different man. He no t'ink of defending 'self,&#10;with friend in danger. Help one another, and all get to hut.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This sounds well, old Tom,&quot; said Hurry, winking and laughing, though he&#10;too used the precaution to speak low--&quot;Give me a ready witted squaw&#10;for a fri'nd, and though I'll not downright defy an Iroquois, I think I&#10;would defy the devil.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No talk loud,&quot; said Hist. &quot;Some Iroquois got Yengeese tongue, and all&#10;got Yengeese ear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have" />
    <node id=" the Delaware tongue.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis as you think, Sarpent,&quot; answered Deerslayer, whose remarks we&#10;always translate into English, preserving as much as possible of the&#10;peculiar phraseology and manner of the man, &quot;'Tis just so, as any one&#10;may see, and 'tis all founded in natur'. One sister loves finery, some&#10;say overmuch; while t'other is as meek and lowly as God ever created&#10;goodness and truth. Yet, after all, I dare say that Judith has her&#10;vartues, and Hetty has her failin's.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the 'Feeble-Mind' has seen the chist opened?&quot; inquired&#10;Chingachgook, with curiosity in his glance.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sartain; that much I've heard from her own lips; and, for that matter,&#10;so have you. It seems her father doesn't misgive her discretion, though&#10;he does that of his eldest darter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then the key is hid only from the Wild Rose?&quot; for so Chingachgook&#10;had begun gallantly to term Judith, in his private discourse with his&#10;friend.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on Judith's reaction to wearing the gown and Deerslayer's observations, it can be inferred that she enjoys finery but appreciates her natural charm even more. She initially agrees to wear the extravagant gown made for a lady of high station, but upon hearing Deerslayer's sincere praise of her natural beauty, she decides to take off the gown. This indicates that she values compliments about her natural appearance and prefers not to overshadow it with excessive finery.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Deerslayer's generalization about women preferring their native charms seems accurate in Judith's case since, despite initially wearing the gown, she ultimately chooses to present herself authentically when meeting the Mingos. By doing so, she highlights her confidence in her natural charm and her ability to influence others without relying on materialistic adornments.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judith values finery but places a higher importance on her own natural charm and the power of authenticity." />

In&#10;my eyes, Judith, a modest maiden never looks more becoming than when&#10;becomingly clad, and nothing is suitable that is out of character.&#10;Besides, gal, if there's a creatur' in the colony that can afford to&#10;do without finery, and to trust to her own good looks and sweet&#10;countenance, it's yourself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll take off the rubbish this instant, Deerslayer,&quot; cried the girl,&#10;springing up to leave the room, &quot;and never do I wish to see it on any&#10;human being, again.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So it is with 'em, all, Sarpent,&quot; said the other, turning to his friend&#10;and laughing, as soon as the beauty had disappeared. &quot;They like finery,&#10;but they like their natyve charms most of all.

Are you sartain you&#10;could find it in your heart to part with your own finery?&quot;&#10;&#10;The soothing allusion to the personal charms of the girl was well timed,&#10;to counteract the effect produced by the distrust that the young man&#10;expressed of Judith's devotion to her filial duties. Had another said&#10;as much as Deerslayer, the compliment would most probably have been&#10;overlooked in the indignation awakened by the doubts, but even the&#10;unpolished sincerity, that so often made this simple minded hunter bare&#10;his thoughts, had a charm for the girl; and while she colored, and for&#10;an instant her eyes flashed fire, she could not find it in her heart&#10;to be really angry with one whose very soul seemed truth and manly&#10;kindness. Look her reproaches she did, but" />

When she&#10;returned, both Deerslayer and Chingachgook, who had passed the brief&#10;time of her absence in taking a second look at the male garments, arose&#10;in surprise, each permitting exclamations of wonder and pleasure to&#10;escape him, in a way so unequivocal as to add new lustre to the eyes&#10;of Judith, by flushing her cheeks with a glow of triumph. Affecting,&#10;however, not to notice the impression she had made, the girl seated&#10;herself with the stateliness of a queen, desiring that the chest might&#10;be looked into, further.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know a better way to treat with the Mingos, gal,&quot; cried&#10;Deerslayer, &quot;than to send you ashore as you be, and to tell 'em that a&#10;queen has arrived among 'em!

In the narrative, Hetty's coarse clothing is contrasted with Judith's delicate and finer clothing, suggesting that Judith would be unlikely to rummage through rough or unfashionable garments. This further strengthens Deerslayer's belief in the ingenuity of the conjecture made by Chingachgook about the key being hidden among coarse clothes." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Deerslayer, if we can find the key, I will authorize you to open&#10;the chest, and to take such things from it as you may think will buy&#10;father's ransom.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;First find the key, gal; we'll talk of the rest a'terwards. Sarpent,&#10;you've eyes like a fly, and a judgment that's seldom out. Can you help&#10;us in calculating where Floating Tom would be apt to keep the key of a&#10;chist that he holds to be as private as this?&quot;&#10;&#10;The Delaware had taken no part in the discourse until he was thus&#10;directly appealed to, when he quitted the chest, which had continued to&#10;attract his attention, and cast about him for the place in which a key&#10;would be likely to be concealed under such circumstances. As Judith and&#10;Deerslayer were not idle the while, the whole three were soon engaged in&#10;an anxious and spirited search. As it was certain that the desired key&#10;was not to be found in any of the common drawers or closets, of which&#10;there were several in the building, none looked there, but all turned&#10;their inquiries to those places that struck them as ingenious hiding&#10;" />

    <node id=" There is the chest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, there is the chest as you say, Judith, and when the question gets&#10;to be between a secret and a scalp, I should think most men would prefer&#10;keeping the last. Did your father ever give you any downright commands&#10;consarning that chist?&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never. He has always appeared to think its locks, and its steel bands,&#10;and its strength, its best protection.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis a rare chest, and altogether of curious build,&quot; returned&#10;Deerslayer, rising and approaching the thing in question, on which&#10;he seated himself, with a view to examine it with greater ease.&#10;&quot;Chingachgook, this is no wood that comes of any forest that you or I&#10;have ever trailed through! 'Tisn't the black walnut, and yet it's quite&#10;as comely, if not more so, did the smoke and the treatment give it fair&#10;play.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Delaware drew near, felt of the wood, examined its grain, endeavored&#10;to indent the surface with a nail, and passed his hand curiously over&#10;the steel bands, the heavy padlocks, and the other novel peculiarities&#10;of the massive box." />

The blood rushed to her face, as much with&#10;resentment, perhaps, as with shame, and she bit her lip, though she&#10;continued silent. Deerslayer and his friend now discovered the delicacy&#10;of men of native refinement, neither smiling or even by a glance&#10;betraying how completely he understood the motives and ingenuity of this&#10;clever artifice. The former, who had taken the key from the Indian, led&#10;the way into the adjoining room, and applying it to a lock ascertained&#10;that the right instrument had actually been found. There were three&#10;padlocks, each of which however was easily opened by this single key.&#10;Deerslayer removed them all, loosened the hasps, raised the lid a little&#10;to make certain it was loose, and then he drew back from the chest&#10;several feet, signing to his friend to follow.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a family chist, Judith,&quot; he said, &quot;and 'tis like to hold family&#10;secrets.

The chist is your'n,&#10;or your father's; and Hutter is your father, not mine. Cur'osity is a&#10;woman's, and not a man's failing, and there you have got all the reasons&#10;before you.

    <node id="The narrative suggests that Deerslayer urges Chingachgook to take off the fine gentleman's coat and wear more suitable garments because he is concerned about the practicality of the situation. The coat, while impressive and valuable-looking, does not fit Chingachgook's needs as an Indian warrior. Instead, Deerslayer encourages his friend to focus on what is truly important in their current dangerous circumstances, rather than getting distracted by material possessions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the coat may serve as a symbol of cultural differences between Deerslayer and Chingachgook. Deerslayer recognizes that while Chingachgook may appreciate the beauty and craftsmanship of the coat, it is not appropriate for his way of life. By urging Chingachgook to take off the coat and wear something more suitable, Deerslayer reinforces their shared values as men of action who prioritize practicality over luxury.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Deerslayer's appreciation for Chingachgook's quick-wittedness in suggesting to hide the key among coarse clothes highlights the gendered expectations of their roles. While Deerslayer questions Judith's willingness to part with her fine clothes due to her femininity, Chingachgook demonstrates his practicality and readiness for action, which is further emphasized by Deerslayer encouraging him to prioritize functionality over finery." />
    <node id=" of the canvas covering.&#10;This was done deliberately, and in as cautious a manner as if it were&#10;believed that fabrics of a delicate construction lay hidden beneath.&#10;When the canvass was removed, the first articles that came in view were&#10;some of the habiliments of the male sex. They were of fine materials,&#10;and, according to the fashions of the age, were gay in colours and rich&#10;in ornaments. One coat in particular was of scarlet, and had button&#10;holes worked in gold thread. Still it was not military, but was part of&#10;the attire of a civilian of condition, at a period when social rank&#10;was rigidly respected in dress. Chingachgook could not refrain from an&#10;exclamation of pleasure, as soon as Deerslayer opened this coat and held&#10;it up to view, for, notwithstanding all his trained self-command, the&#10;splendor of the vestment was too much for the philosophy of an Indian.&#10;Deerslayer turned quickly, and he regarded his friend with momentary&#10;displeasure as this burst of weakness escaped him, and then he&#10;soliloquized, as was his practice whenever any strong feeling suddenly&#10;got the ascendancy" />

This is an extr'ornary garment, too, and&#10;extr'ornary things get up extr'ornary feelin's. I think this will do,&#10;Judith, for the Indian heart is hardly to be found in all America that&#10;can withstand colours like these, and glitter like that. If this coat&#10;was ever made for your father, you've come honestly by the taste for&#10;finery, you have.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That coat was never made for father,&quot; answered the girl, quickly--&quot;it&#10;is much too long, while father is short and square.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Cloth was plenty if it was, and glitter cheap,&quot; answered Deerslayer,&#10;with his silent, joyous laugh. &quot;Sarpent, this garment was made for a man&#10;of your size, and I should like to see it on your shoulders.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chingachgook, nothing loath" />
    <node id="Thomas Hutter's darter, or Judith, initially agrees to wear the extravagant gown made for a lady of high station. However, after hearing Deerslayer's genuine praise for her natural beauty, she decides to take off the gown. This demonstrates that Judith values compliments about her authentic appearance and prefers not to overshadow it with excessive finery.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer observes that women like their native charms more than finery and is pleased when Judith removes the gown. He believes that she looks more becoming when clad in a manner consistent with her character, rather than wearing clothes that are out of place for someone of her class. Deerslayer's generalization about women proves accurate in Judith's case since, despite initially wearing the gown, she ultimately chooses to present herself authentically when meeting the Mingos.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judith enjoys finery but values her own natural charm and authenticity more, as evidenced by her decision to remove the extravagant gown after hearing Deerslayer's praise for her natural beauty. Deerslayer and Sarpent react positively to Judith's choice to embrace her authentic self over materialistic adornments." />
    <node id="&quot;Then you think, Deerslayer, that Thomas Hutter has no one in his&#10;family--no child--no daughter, to whom this dress may be thought&#10;becoming, and whom you could wish to see in it, once and awhile, even&#10;though it should be at long intervals, and only in playfulness?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I understand you, Judith--yes, I now understand your meaning, and I&#10;think I can say, your wishes. That you are as glorious in that dress as&#10;the sun when it rises or sets in a soft October day, I'm ready to allow,&#10;and that you greatly become it is a good deal more sartain than that it&#10;becomes you. There's gifts in clothes, as well as in other things. Now&#10;I do not think that a warrior on his first path ought to lay on the same&#10;awful paints as a chief that has had his virtue tried, and knows from&#10;exper'ence he will not disgrace his pretensions. So it is with all of&#10;us, red or white. You are Thomas Hutter's darter, and that gownd was&#10;made for the child of some governor, or a lady of high station, and it&#10;" />

No--no--I'm well as&#10;I am; and if not, I can be no better. Lay the coat down on the blanket,&#10;Sarpent, and let us look farther into the chist.&quot;&#10;&#10;The tempting garment, one surely that was never intended for Hutter, was&#10;laid aside, and the examination proceeded. The male attire, all of which&#10;corresponded with the coat in quality, was soon exhausted, and then&#10;succeeded female.

    <node id="Hist, the shrewd Huron girl, brought Hetty to the Iroquois camp with the motive of protecting her new friend and investing her with a sacredness and respect that would ensure her safety. Hist exaggerated Hetty's mental deficiency and explained her intentions in coming among her enemies, which had the intended effect of creating a sense of reverence for their visitor.&#10;&#10;Hist's tactics included:&#10;&#10;1. Attracting the attention of the warriors by appearing indifferent and stimulating their curiosity.&#10;2. Speaking to the warriors in general terms about Hetty, relating the object of her visit and investing her with a sacred character.&#10;3. Withdrawing to a distance and preparing a meal for Hetty while observing any changes in the countenances of the chiefs or occurrences that could affect her own interests or those of her friend.&#10;&#10;These actions demonstrate Hist's shrewdness and cunning, as she effectively manipulated the situation to ensure Hetty's safety among her enemies." />

She was too&#10;well trained in the habits of her people to obtrude the opinions of one&#10;of her sex and years on men and warriors, but nature had furnished&#10;a tact and ingenuity that enabled her to attract the attention she&#10;desired, without wounding the pride of those to whom it was her duty to&#10;defer and respect. Even her affected indifference stimulated curiosity,&#10;and Hetty had hardly reached the side of her father, before the Delaware&#10;girl was brought within the circle of the warriors, by a secret but&#10;significant gesture. Here she was questioned as to the person of her&#10;companion, and the motives that had brought her to the camp. This&#10;was all that Hist desired. She explained the manner in which she had&#10;detected the weakness of Hetty's reason, rather exaggerating than&#10;lessening the deficiency in her intellect, and then she related in&#10;general terms the object of the girl in venturing among her enemies.&#10;The effect was all that the speaker expected, her account investing the&#10;person and" />

When she manifested an&#10;intention to quit them, therefore, they offered no obstacle, though they&#10;saw she was about to join the group of chiefs who were consulting apart,&#10;seemingly on the manner and motive of her own sudden appearance.&#10;&#10;When Hist--for so we love best to call her--quitted her companion, she&#10;strayed near one or two of the elder warriors, who had shown her most&#10;kindness in her captivity, the principal man of whom had even offered to&#10;adopt her as his child if she would consent to become a Huron.

As soon as her own purpose was&#10;attained, Hist withdrew to a distance, where, with female consideration&#10;and a sisterly tenderness she set about the preparation of a meal, to be&#10;offered to her new friend as soon as the latter might be at liberty to&#10;partake of it. While thus occupied, however, the ready girl in no degree&#10;relaxed in her watchfulness, noting every change of countenance among&#10;the chiefs, every movement of Hetty's, and the smallest occurrence that&#10;could be likely to affect her own interests, or that of her new friend.&#10;&#10;As Hetty approached the chiefs they opened their little circle, with an&#10;ease and deference of manner that would have done credit to men of more&#10;courtly origin. A fallen tree lay near, and the oldest of the warriors&#10;made a quiet sign for the girl to be seated on it, taking his place at&#10;her side with the gentleness of a father" />
    <node id=" the manner in&#10;which they glanced at Hetty as they conversed together, that she was&#10;the subject of their discourse, and probable that the reasons of her&#10;unlooked-for appearance were matters of discussion. This phlegm of&#10;manner is characteristic of the North American Indian--some say of his&#10;white successor also--but, in this case much should be attributed to the&#10;peculiar situation in which the party was placed. The force in the Ark,&#10;the presence of Chingachgook excepted, was well known, no tribe or body&#10;of troops was believed to be near, and vigilant eyes were posted round&#10;the entire lake, watching day and night the slightest movement of those&#10;whom it would not be exaggerated now to term the besieged.&#10;&#10;Hutter was inwardly much moved by the conduct of Hetty, though he&#10;affected so much indifference of manner. He recollected her gentle&#10;appeal to him before he left the Ark, and misfortune rendered that of&#10;weight which might have been forgotten amid the triumph of success. Then&#10;he knew the simple, single-hearted fidelity of his child, and understood&#10;why she had come, and the total disregard of self that reigned" />

    <node id="Hetty's objective in approaching the Iroquois chiefs is to explain the reason for her companion's (Hist's) presence among them and to speak plainly about the actions of her father and Hurry.

Hetty is known for her simple, single-hearted fidelity and disregard for self, which allows her to act with sincerity and conviction. Additionally, she trusts in Hist's ability to accurately translate her words into the Iroquois language, ensuring that her message will be communicated effectively to the chiefs." />
    <node id="1. Hetty should respond by acknowledging the contradiction between the teachings of her sacred book and the actions of some white people, including her father and Hurry Harry. She can express her regret and shame over this inconsistency and assure the chiefs that she personally believes in treating all people with kindness and respect, as taught in her sacred volume.&#10;2. Hetty can also emphasize that the behavior of her father and others does not represent the values and actions of all white people, and that there are those among them who genuinely seek peace and mutual understanding with the Native Americans.&#10;3. Additionally, Hetty could propose a dialogue between the chiefs and more open-minded white leaders to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and work towards building trust and respect between their communities. This action would demonstrate her commitment to the teachings of her sacred book and her willingness to take responsibility for promoting positive change." />
    <node id="Based on the description, a densely wooded encampment would not be visible in its entirety at once due to the surrounding trees. Huts made of tree branches and bark are scattered around, with no open area for gathering. A single fire serves as the center of attraction, and children are present, giving it a domestic feel. The inhabitants, mostly warriors, are watchful and apprehensive, while women and children are also present. They live in low huts or kennels, which they use at night or during storms. Their lifestyle appears to be simple, with few possessions beyond basic cooking utensils, clothing, rifles, and hunting trophies. The atmosphere is covert, suggesting a need for secrecy and caution. The encampment's temporary nature further emphasizes its transient and guarded nature." />
    <node id=" and they were uniformly topped with bark that had been&#10;stripped from fallen trees; of which every virgin forest possesses&#10;hundreds, in all stages of decay. Of furniture they had next to none.&#10;Cooking utensils of the simplest sort were lying near the fire, a few&#10;articles of clothing were to be seen in or around the huts, rifles,&#10;horns, and pouches leaned against the trees, or were suspended from the&#10;lower branches, and the carcasses of two or three deer were stretched to&#10;view on the same natural shambles.&#10;&#10;As the encampment was in the midst of a dense wood, the eye could not&#10;take in its tout ensemble at a glance, but hut after hut started out of&#10;the gloomy picture, as one gazed about him in quest of objects. There&#10;was no centre, unless the fire might be so considered, no open area&#10;where the possessors of this rude village might congregate, but all was&#10;dark, covert and cunning, like its owners. A few children strayed from&#10;hut to hut, giving the spot a little of the air of domestic life, and&#10;the suppressed laugh and low voices of the women occasionally broke&#10;in upon" />

One fire, that had&#10;been kindled against the roots of a living oak, sufficed for the whole&#10;party; the weather being too mild to require it for any purpose but&#10;cooking. Scattered around this centre of attraction, were some fifteen&#10;or twenty low huts, or perhaps kennels would be a better word, into&#10;which their different owners crept at night, and which were also&#10;intended to meet the exigencies of a storm.&#10;&#10;These little huts were made of the branches of trees, put together with&#10;some ingenuity, and they were uniformly topped with bark that had been&#10;stripped from fallen trees; of which every virgin forest possesses&#10;hundreds, in all stages of decay" />
    <node id=" a piece of wood,&#10;loaded with iron as it is.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer spoke, he applied his own strength to the effort, and&#10;succeeded in raising the lid against the timbers of the house, where he&#10;took care to secure it by a sufficient prop. Judith fairly trembled&#10;as she cast her first glance at the interior, and she felt a temporary&#10;relief in discovering that a piece of canvas, that was carefully tucked&#10;in around the edges, effectually concealed all beneath it. The chest was&#10;apparently well stored, however, the canvas lying within an inch of the&#10;lid.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here's a full cargo,&quot; said Deerslayer, eyeing the arrangement, &quot;and&#10;we had needs go to work leisurely and at our ease. Sarpent, bring some&#10;stools while I spread this blanket on the floor, and then we'll begin&#10;work orderly and in comfort.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Delaware complied, Deerslayer civilly placed a stool for Judith,&#10;took one himself, and commenced the removal of the canvas covering.&#10;This was done deliberately, and in as cautious a manner as if it were&#10;believed that fabrics of a delicate construction lay hidden" />

The presence of the&#10;women had induced the attempt at this ruse, the strength of these&#10;feebler members of the party being unequal to the effort of escaping&#10;from the pursuit of warriors. When the reader remembers the vast extent&#10;of the American wilderness, at that early day, he will perceive that&#10;it was possible for even a tribe to remain months undiscovered in&#10;particular portions of it; nor was the danger of encountering a foe, the&#10;usual precautions being observed, as great in the woods," />
    <node id="1. Hetty is trying to convey the teachings of Christian charity and forgiveness to Wah-ta-Wah and the chiefs by reading and explaining passages from the Bible, particularly focusing on verses that promote love, kindness, and blessings towards one's enemies, curses, haters, and persecutors. She hopes to encourage them to forgive those who have wronged them and to demonstrate Christian forgiveness in their interactions with others." />
    <node id=" Hist,&quot; she added. &quot;'Love your enemies, bless them&#10;that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which&#10;despitefully use you and persecute you.'&quot;&#10;&#10;By this time Hetty had become excited; her eye gleamed with the&#10;earnestness of her feelings, her cheeks flushed, and her voice, usually&#10;so low and modulated, became stronger and more impressive. With the&#10;Bible she had been early made familiar by her mother, and she now turned&#10;from passage to passage with surprising rapidity, taking care to cull&#10;such verses as taught the sublime lessons of Christian charity and&#10;Christian forgiveness. To translate half she said, in her pious&#10;earnestness, Wah-ta-Wah would have found impracticable, had she made the&#10;effort, but wonder held her tongue tied, equally with the chiefs, and&#10;the young, simple-minded enthusiast had fairly become exhausted with&#10;her own efforts, before the other opened her mouth, again, to utter a&#10;syllable.

Hurry,&#10;when interrogated, confessed the truth, though he would have been&#10;more disposed to concealment than his sterner companion, did the&#10;circumstances very well admit of its adoption. But he had tact enough to&#10;discover that equivocation would be useless, at that moment, and he made&#10;a merit of necessity by imitating a frankness, which, in the case&#10;of Hutter, was the offspring of habits of indifference acting on&#10;a disposition that was always ruthless, and reckless of personal&#10;consequences.&#10;&#10;As soon as the chiefs had received the answers to their questions, they&#10;walked away in silence, like men who deemed the matter disposed of,&#10;all Hetty's dogmas being thrown away on beings trained in violence from&#10;infancy to manhood. Hetty and Hist were now left alone with Hutter and&#10;Hurry, no visible restraint being placed on the movements of either;&#10;though all four, in fact, were vigilantly and unceasingly watched. As&#10;respects the men, care was had to prevent" />
    <node id="1. The passage suggests that the contradiction between the teachings of the sacred book and the actions of some white people, such as Hetty's father and Hurry Harry, is due to a combination of factors, including misunderstanding, cultural differences, and self-interest. Some white people may not fully grasp or prioritize the teachings of the sacred book, while others might use it selectively to further their own goals, such as obtaining resources or asserting dominance over the Native Americans.&#10;2. Hetty can address this issue by acknowledging the discrepancy between the teachings and actions of some white people, expressing her regret and shame over this inconsistency, and emphasizing that not all white people behave in this way. She can also propose a dialogue between the chiefs and more open-minded white leaders to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and work towards building trust and respect between their communities.&#10;3. It is important to note that addressing intercultural misunderstandings and contradictions requires active listening, empathy, and a willingness to engage in honest dialogue. By taking responsibility for promoting positive change and demonstrating her commitment to the teachings of her sacred book, Hetty can contribute to a more constructive conversation between the two groups." />

Tell 'em&#10;somet'ing they believe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hist was about to proceed, notwithstanding, when a tap on the shoulder&#10;from the finger of the oldest chief caused her to look up. She then&#10;perceived that one of the warriors had left the group, and was already&#10;returning to it with Hutter and Hurry. Understanding that the two&#10;last were to become parties in the inquiry, she became mute, with&#10;the unhesitating obedience of an Indian woman. In a few seconds the&#10;prisoners stood face to face with the principal men of the captors." />
    <node id="Deerslayer's sincerity and honesty have a powerful impact on those around him, as his words go straight to the heart and are based on understanding. When he praises someone, it brings them great pleasure and convinces them of his unbending honesty. This was evident in his relationship with Judith, where his genuine praise for her natural beauty led her to remove an extravagant gown, valuing his commendation over materialistic adornments.&#10;&#10;In Judith's case, Deerslayer's sincerity and honesty not only influenced her preferences but also awakened a respect and affection that made it painful for her when he criticized or rebuked. His influence extended beyond Judith, as officers of rank in his later life listened to his commendations with pleasure, demonstrating that his natural consequence of truth and fair-dealing had a wide-reaching impact.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer's sincerity and honesty have a profound influence and impact on the people around him. His genuine praise creates deep respect, affection, and conviction of his unbending honesty, affecting not only personal relationships but also the way others perceive and value his opinions throughout his life." />
    <node id=" a power of praising that&#10;no quality but sincerity can bestow, since his words go directly to&#10;the heart, finding their support in the understanding. Thus it was with&#10;Deerslayer and Judith. So soon and so deeply did this simple hunter&#10;impress those who knew him with a conviction of his unbending honesty,&#10;that all he uttered in commendation was as certain to please, as all he&#10;uttered in the way of rebuke was as certain to rankle and excite enmity,&#10;where his character had not awakened a respect and affection, that in&#10;another sense rendered it painful. In after life, when the career of&#10;this untutored being brought him in contact with officers of rank, and&#10;others entrusted with the care of the interests of the state, this same&#10;influence was exerted on a wider field, even generals listening to his&#10;commendations with a glow of pleasure, that it was not always in the&#10;power of their official superiors to awaken. Perhaps Judith was the&#10;first individual of his own colour who fairly submitted to this natural&#10;consequence of truth and fair-dealing on the part of Deerslayer. She had&#10;actually pined for his praise, and she had now received" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Deerslayer suggests offering the fine clothes as ransom to the Iroquois in an attempt to help secure the release of Judith's father and sister. He believes that these items could serve as valuable trade goods, potentially swaying the emotions of the Iroquois leaders and helping to ensure a positive outcome for their captives.&#10;&#10;However, Judith disagrees with Deerslayer's viewpoint because she feels that such garments would be of little use in appeasing the Iroquois. Given her knowledge of Native American culture and customs, she understands that fine clothing may not have the same value or significance to them as it does in European societies. Thus, Judith believes that there are likely other, more effective means of securing her family's freedom, rendering Deerslayer's suggestion less useful in her eyes.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer suggests offering fine clothes as ransom to the Iroquois due to their perceived value in European societies, while Judith disagrees with this viewpoint because she understands that such garments may not hold the same significance for Native Americans, and there might be more effective ways of ensuring her family's safe return." />
    <node id="Based on Judith's reaction to wearing the extravagant gown made for a lady of high station, it is evident that she enjoys finery but appreciates her natural charm even more. Initially, she agrees to wear the gown, which shows her enjoyment of fine clothing. However, upon hearing Deerslayer's sincere praise of her natural beauty, she decides to take off the gown, indicating that she values compliments about her authentic appearance and prefers not to overshadow it with excessive finery. This demonstrates that Judith values her own natural charm and authenticity more, as evidenced by her decision to remove the extravagant gown after hearing Deerslayer's praise for her natural beauty.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when meeting the Mingos, she chooses to present herself authentically, emphasizing her confidence in her natural charm and her ability to influence others without relying on materialistic adornments. Deerslayer and Sarpent react positively to Judith's choice to embrace her authentic self over materialistic adornments.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Judith enjoys finery, she places a higher importance on her own natural charm and authenticity, as evidenced by her decision to remove the extravagant gown after hearing Deerslayer's praise for her natural beauty. This highlights her confidence in her natural charm and her ability to influence others without relying on materialistic adornments." />
    <node id="The party created a temporary encampment in the woods using branches of trees and bark from fallen trees for the construction of low huts or kennels. The encampment featured a single fire for cooking, and the huts served as shelter for their different owners at night or during storms. This type of encampment is similar to a bivouac, providing only rough protection and relieved slightly by the ingenuity of those who frequently live in such conditions. The atmosphere of the encampment was covert and guarded, emphasizing its temporary nature and the need for secrecy and caution due to the danger of encountering enemies in the woods during their journey." />
    <node id="The purpose of opening the mysterious chest is to find valuable items that could be used as a ransom for the release of prisoners. The chest has been kept secret from Judith, which led to her curiosity and desire for answers. When they open the chest, they find a pair of curiously inlaid pistols, suggesting that there might be other valuable objects inside. The fact that Judith's parents never mentioned the chest before adds to its mysterious nature and increases the anticipation of what they might find inside." />

Nevertheless the time had come when&#10;it would seem that this mystery was to be explained, and that under&#10;circumstances, too, which left her very little choice in the matter.&#10;&#10;Finding that both her companions were watching her movements, in grave&#10;silence, Judith placed a hand on the lid and endeavored to raise it. Her&#10;strength, however, was insufficient, and it appeared to the girl, who&#10;was fully aware that all the fastenings were removed, that she was&#10;resisted in an unhallowed attempt by some supernatural power.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot raise the lid, Deerslayer!&quot; she said--&quot;Had we not better give&#10;up the attempt, and find some other means of releasing the prisoners?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not so--Judith; not so, gal. No means are as sartain and easy, as a&#10;good bribe,&quot; answered the other. &quot;As for the lid, 'tis held by nothing&#10;but its own weight, which is prodigious for so small a piece of wood,&#10;loaded with iron as it is.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer spoke, he applied his own strength to the effort, and&#10;" />

When you've got through give us a call, and&#10;we'll all sit in council together touching the valie of the articles.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop, Deerslayer,&quot; exclaimed the girl, as he was about to withdraw.&#10;&quot;Not a single thing will I touch--I will not even raise the lid--unless&#10;you are present. Father and Hetty have seen fit to keep the inside of&#10;this chest a secret from me, and I am much too proud to pry into their&#10;hidden treasures unless it were for their own good. But on no account&#10;will I open the chest alone. Stay with me, then; I want witnesses of&#10;what I do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I rather think, Sarpent, that the gal is right!

Well,&#10;when all is before us we may, indeed, best judge which to offer for the&#10;ransom, and which to withhold.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith was not altogether as disinterested in her feelings as she&#10;affected to be. She remembered that the curiosity of Hetty had&#10;been indulged in connection with this chest, while her own had been&#10;disregarded, and she was not sorry to possess an opportunity of being&#10;placed on a level with her less gifted sister in this one particular. It&#10;appearing to be admitted all round that the enquiry into the contents of&#10;the chest ought to be renewed, Deerslayer proceeded to remove the second&#10;covering of canvass.&#10;&#10;The articles that lay uppermost, when the curtain was again raised on&#10;the secrets of the chest, were a pair of pistols, curiously inlaid with&#10;silver. Their value would have been considerable in one of the towns" />

Habit had rendered this so easy, and so&#10;much a matter of course, that it was only quite recently the girl had&#10;began even to muse on the singularity of the circumstance. But there had&#10;never been sufficient intimacy between Hutter and his eldest daughter to&#10;invite confidence. At times he was kind, but in general, with her more&#10;especially, he was stern and morose. Least of all had his authority been&#10;exercised in a way to embolden his child to venture on the liberty she&#10;was about to take, without many misgivings of the consequences, although&#10;the liberty proceeded from a desire to serve himself. Then Judith was&#10;not altogether free from a little superstition on the subject of this&#10;chest, which had stood a sort of tabooed relic before her eyes from&#10;childhood to the present hour. Nevertheless the time had come when&#10;it would seem that this mystery was to be explained, and that" />

Judith has a&#10;right to ask us to be present, and should the chist hold any of Master&#10;Hutter's secrets, they will fall into the keeping of two as close&#10;mouthed young men as are to be found. We will stay with you, Judith--but&#10;first let us take a look at the lake and the shore, for this chist will&#10;not be emptied in a minute.&quot;&#10;&#10;The two men now went out on the platform, and Deerslayer swept the shore&#10;with the glass, while the Indian gravely turned his eye on the water and&#10;the woods, in quest of any sign that might betray the machinations&#10;of their enemies. Nothing was visible, and assured of their temporary&#10;security, the three collected around the chest again, with the avowed&#10;object of opening it.&#10;&#10;Judith had held this chest and its unknown contents in a species of&#10;reverence as long as she could remember.

    <node id="Deerslayer and Chingachgook discuss the matter of women wearing distinctive clothing or remaining simply dressed in a practical sense, understanding that different situations call for different types of attire. They appreciate the value of functional clothing that suits the demands of their surroundings and tasks. In this context, they highlight Judith's preference for her natural charm over excessive finery when meeting the Mingos.&#10;&#10;This discussion ties into the concept of knowing one's true value and identity because Deerslayer and Chingachgook recognize that authenticity is crucial in presenting oneself to others. By embracing their genuine identities, they can effectively navigate various situations and connect with people on a deeper level. In Judith's case, she values her natural charm more than the extravagant gown because it allows her to be true to herself and have confidence in her ability to influence others without relying on materialistic adornments.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer and Chingachgook's discussion about distinctive clothing versus simplicity highlights the value of authenticity and understanding one's true worth. By being genuine, individuals can build trust, connect more authentically with others, and maintain their integrity in various situations." />
    <node id="When Hetty suddenly appeared amongst the Iroquois camp, there were varying reactions from her father and the savages present. Her father, who had adopted the stoicism of the Indians, showed no alarm or surprise at her arrival. The Indians themselves also betrayed no signs of surprise, demonstrating their restraint and self-command.&#10;&#10;The arrival of Hetty created a ripple effect, attracting a few warriors to gather around her. The manner in which they glanced at Hetty as they conversed together indicated that she was the subject of their discussion. It is probable that Hist had informed them of Hetty's background and intentions, investing her with a sacred character that would ensure her safety among her enemies.&#10;&#10;The topic of conversation among the warriors seemed to revolve around Hetty and the reasons for her arrival in the camp. The shrewd Huron girl, Hist, had taken it upon herself to protect Hetty by attracting the attention of the warriors and speaking to them in general terms about Hetty's person and motivations. This served to create a sense of reverence for their visitor, ensuring her safety among her enemies.&#10;&#10;Overall, the arrival of Hetty in the Iroquois camp created much less visible sensation than one might expect in a more civilized community. The stoicism and self-command of the Indians contributed to this muted reaction, as they concealed any surprise or alarm at Hetty's sudden appearance." />

But Hetty was not sufficiently familiar with caresses or&#10;outward demonstrations of fondness, to indulge in any outbreaking of&#10;feeling. She merely approached and stood at her father's side without&#10;speaking, resembling a silent statue of filial affection. The old man&#10;expressed neither alarm nor surprise at her sudden appearance. In these&#10;particulars he had caught the stoicism of the Indians, well knowing&#10;that there was no more certain mode of securing their respect than by&#10;imitating their self-command. Nor did the savages themselves betray the&#10;least sign of surprise at this sudden appearance of a stranger among&#10;them. In a word, this arrival produced much less visible sensation,&#10;though occurring under circumstances so peculiar, than would be seen in&#10;a village of higher pretensions to civilization did an ordinary traveler&#10;drive up to the door of its principal inn.&#10;&#10;Still a few warriors collected, and it was evident by the manner in&#10;which they glanced at Hetty as they conversed together, that she was&#10;the subject of their discourse, and probable that the reasons" />

She says, &quot;No talk loud,&quot; said Hist. &quot;Some Iroquois got Yengeese tongue, and all got Yengeese ear.&quot; This demonstrates her awareness of their precarious situation and the need for secrecy in order to avoid detection by the Iroquois." />
    <node id="Hutter is opposed to the idea of breaking open the chest because he suspects that the Iroquois have other plans in motion, and opening the chest might be dangerous or ill-timed. Instead, he suggests relying on Hist's help with their escape, as long as they act quickly if there is a need for action. He also brings up the issue of trusting the Iroquois, particularly Wah-ta-Wah, who may not be entirely reliable in assisting them to run away from the encampment.&#10;&#10;In addition to these concerns, Hutter expresses his dissatisfaction with Judith's plan due to its dishonest nature. He might feel that breaking into a chest belonging to someone else goes against their moral values and could damage their reputation or standing among the Iroquois. In this context, it is essential for them to maintain good relationships with the Iroquois and avoid any actions that may be perceived as underhanded or deceitful.&#10;&#10;Hutter's primary concern is ensuring the safety of his daughter Judith, Hetty, and Hurry by finding a diplomatic solution through speaking plainly and truthfully to the Iroquois chiefs. This approach aligns with Hetty's character, known for her simple, single-hearted fidelity and disregard for self, allowing her to act with sincerity and conviction. Hutter believes that this is the wisest way for them to resolve their conflict with the Iroquois and secure their release from captivity." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Hetty's unexpected arrival at the lake was a subject of discussion among the Iroquois warriors. The manner in which they glanced at Hetty as they conversed together suggested that she was the topic of their discourse. This, along with Hist taking the initiative to protect Hetty and speak to the warriors about her, indicates that Hetty's arrival created a ripple effect in the camp.&#10;&#10;Regarding Hutter's feelings towards Hetty, he was inwardly moved by her conduct, despite affecting indifference. He recalled her gentle appeal to him before leaving the Ark, and the misfortune of her sudden appearance made it weigh heavily on his mind. He understood the simple, single-hearted fidelity of his child and recognized that she had come out of concern for him, disregarding her own safety. Therefore, it can be inferred that Hutter likely felt a mix of surprise, worry, and pride for his daughter's unexpected arrival at the lake." />
    <node id="In the passage, Hurstwood describes the limited freedom he experiences in prison. Although he can look around freely, his movements are restricted, and he cannot use his limbs as he would like due to the confines of his imprisonment.

Hurstwood mentions that there isn't a jail in the colony as tight as the one they are in, suggesting that his freedom is severely limited, and breaking out would be challenging.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Hurstwood highlights the fact that he has experience with jails, having been in a few before, and understands their materials and construction.

She can express her regret and shame over this inconsistency and assure the chiefs that she personally believes in treating all people with kindness and respect, as taught in her sacred volume.&#10;2. Hetty should emphasize that the behavior of her father and others does not represent the values and actions of all white people, and that there are those among them who genuinely seek peace and mutual understanding with the Native Americans.&#10;3. Additionally, Hetty could propose a dialogue between the chiefs and more open-minded white leaders to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and work towards building trust and respect between their communities. This action would demonstrate her commitment to the teachings of her sacred book and her willingness to take responsibility for promoting positive change.&#10;4. When asked about the Indian's conduct towards white people, Hetty should explain that the teachings of her sacred book encourage love, kindness, and blessings towards one's enemies, curses, haters, and persecutors. She can express her hope that the chiefs will consider these teachings and extend forgiveness towards those who have wronged them.&#10;5. Hetty should also acknowledge that there are white people who have acted unjustly towards the Native Americans and that this behavior is not in line with the teachings of her sacred book. She can express her regret and shame over this inconsistency and emphasize her personal commitment to treating all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their race or background.&#10;6. Finally, Hetty should propose a dialogue between the chiefs and more open-minded white leaders to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and work towards building trust and respect between their communities.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Hist does not explicitly make a decision regarding helping Hutter and his men in exchange for their promise to return her and her friends to their tribe with the Ark and canoes. However, it is mentioned that she initially refused to assist them in escaping when they proposed breaking open the big chest. Instead, Hist suggested relying on her ability to translate and communicate effectively with the Iroquois chiefs, hoping for a diplomatic solution through honesty and sincerity.&#10;&#10;The text also mentions that Hutter believes relying on Hist's help is their best option as long as they act quickly if there is a need for action. This implies that Hist might be open to assisting them in some way, but her preferred method would involve trusting the Iroquois and communicating openly with them.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Hist does not explicitly agree to help Hutter and his men in exchange for their promise to return her and her friends to their tribe, she is willing to use her skills as a translator and communicator to try and resolve the conflict peacefully and honestly." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Deerslayer hid the key among coarse clothes, specifically Hetty's rough and unfashionable garments, based on his hunch that Judith would be unlikely to search there due to her preference for fine clothing. This decision was influenced by Chingachgook's quick-wittedness and practicality, demonstrating the trust between these two friends from different tribes.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook's comparison of trust between different tribes and nations relates to this situation because it highlights how trust is built on character and judgment, which applies not only to interpersonal relationships but also to understanding human nature in general. By recognizing Judith's preference for fine clothing, Deerslayer made a strategic decision about where to hide the key, showcasing his understanding of her character and demonstrating his own trustworthiness.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer hid the key among coarse clothes because he believed Judith would be least likely to search there given her preference for fine clothing. Chingachgook's comparison of trust between different tribes and nations emphasizes how understanding human nature is essential in building trust and making strategic decisions, such as hiding the key in a place where it would be less likely found based on an individual's characteristics." />
    <node id="The Huron chief intends to express his thoughts about the &quot;Good Book&quot; or Bible that Hist and Hetty have brought among the Iroquois.

The moment she opened her mouth to&#10;speak, however, the old chief gave a gentle sign for her to forbear,&#10;said a few words to one of his juniors, and then waited in silent&#10;patience until the latter had summoned Hist to the party. This&#10;interruption proceeded from the chief's having discovered that there&#10;existed a necessity for an interpreter, few of the Hurons present&#10;understanding the English language, and they but imperfectly.&#10;&#10;Wah-ta-Wah was not sorry to be called upon to be present at the&#10;interview, and least of all in the character in which she was now&#10;wanted.

Hetty and Wah-ta-Wah approach the encampment, and Hetty is surprised to find her father and Hurry &quot;at liberty&quot; among the others, appearing as visitors rather than captives.&#10;&#10;3. Hetty requests that Wah-ta-Wah convey a message to the chiefs, revealing the original intent of her father and Hurry to take scalps for bounty. This revelation has no visible effect on the listeners, who likely consider it meritorious.&#10;&#10;4. Upon hearing about Judith's plan to break open a chest to buy their freedom, Mr. Hutter disapproves, fearing that the Iroquois have other plans in motion. He expresses concern over counting on Wah-ta-Wah's help with their escape.&#10;&#10;5.

Hetty should also acknowledge that there are white people who have acted unjustly towards the Native Americans and that this behavior is not in line with the teachings of her sacred book. She can express her regret and shame over this inconsistency and emphasize her personal commitment to treating all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their race or background.&#10;6. Finally, Hetty should propose a dialogue between the chiefs and more open-minded white leaders to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and work towards building trust and respect between their communities. This action would demonstrate her commitment to the teachings of her sacred book and her willingness to take responsibility for promoting positive change.">

The manner in which they glanced at Hetty as they conversed together indicated that she was the subject of their discussion. It is probable that Hist had informed them of Hetty's background and intentions, investing her with a sacred character that would ensure her safety among her enemies.&#10;&#10;The topic of conversation among the warriors seemed to revolve around Hetty and the reasons for her arrival in the camp. The shrewd Huron girl, Hist, had taken it upon herself to protect Hetty by attracting the attention of the warriors and speaking to them in general terms about Hetty's person and motivations. This served to create a sense of reverence for their visitor, ensuring her safety among her enemies.&#10;&#10;Overall, the arrival of Hetty in the Iroquois camp created much less visible sensation than one might expect in a more civilized community. The stoicism and self-command of the Indians contributed to this muted reaction, as they concealed any surprise or alarm at Hetty's sudden appearance.">

This, along with Hist taking the initiative to protect Hetty and speak to the warriors about her, indicates that Hetty's arrival created a ripple effect in the camp.&#10;&#10;Regarding Hutter's feelings towards Hetty, he was inwardly moved by her conduct, despite affecting indifference. He recalled her gentle appeal to him before leaving the Ark, and the misfortune of her sudden appearance made it weigh heavily on his mind. He understood the simple, single-hearted fidelity of his child and recognized that she had come out of concern for him, disregarding her own safety. Therefore, it can be inferred that Hutter likely felt a mix of surprise, worry, and pride for his daughter's unexpected arrival at the lake.">

    <edge source="Deerslayer and Chingachgook discuss the matter of women wearing distinctive clothing or remaining simply dressed in a practical sense, understanding that different situations call for different types of attire. They appreciate the value of functional clothing that suits the demands of their surroundings and tasks. In this context, they highlight Judith's preference for her natural charm over excessive finery when meeting the Mingos.&#10;&#10;This discussion ties into the concept of knowing one's true value and identity because Deerslayer and Chingachgook recognize that authenticity is crucial in presenting oneself to others. By embracing their genuine identities, they can effectively navigate various situations and connect with people on a deeper level. In Judith's case, she values her natural charm more than the extravagant gown because it allows her to be true to herself and have confidence in her ability to influence others without relying on materialistic adornments.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer and Chingachgook's discussion about distinctive clothing versus simplicity highlights the value of authenticity and understanding one's true worth. By being genuine, individuals can build trust, connect more authentically with others, and maintain their integrity in various situations." target="In the narrative, Deerslayer hid the key among coarse clothes, specifically Hetty's rough and unfashionable garments, based on his hunch that Judith would be unlikely to search there due to her preference for fine clothing. This decision was influenced by Chingachgook's quick-wittedness and practicality, demonstrating the trust between these two friends from different tribes.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook's comparison of trust between different tribes and nations relates to this situation because it highlights how trust is built on character and judgment, which applies not only to interpersonal relationships but also to understanding human nature in general. By recognizing Judith's preference for fine clothing, Deerslayer made a strategic decision about where to hide the key, showcasing his understanding of her character and demonstrating his own trustworthiness.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer hid the key among coarse clothes because he believed Judith would be least likely to search there given her preference for fine clothing. Chingachgook's comparison of trust between different tribes and nations emphasizes how understanding human nature is essential in building trust and making strategic decisions, such as hiding the key in a place where it would be less likely found based on an individual's characteristics.">

    <node id="Si Pond, a space pilot, retires at the age of thirty after his companion Rod's death on a routine Moon run. This tragedy shakes Si, making him realize the dangers of his profession and leading him to retire.&#10;&#10;Si's attitude towards education and work also contributes to his decision to retire. Growing up in the Ultrawelfare State, Si and his contemporaries didn't see the value in excelling acadically. They believed that their Inalienable Basic stock was enough to live on, and there was no need to strive for more. This mindset, coupled with the dangerous nature of his work and the realization that he might not have enough Basic shares to last him long after retirement, prompts Si to retire early rather than risk his life further.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Si views his job as a space pilot as more of a spree or adventure than a career. He celebrates each time he returns from a run, seeing it as a commemoration of dangers met and passed. This attitude towards work makes it easier for him to retire, as he doesn't seem to have a deep emotional investment in his profession beyond the thrill it provides." />
    <node id="ard, but....&quot; Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back." />
    <node id=" you, yourself. Nobody can steal it, nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?&quot;&#10; &#10; The other chuckled again. &quot;It is simply a matter of finding more modern methods, my dear chap.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; II&#10; &#10; Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.&#10; &#10; When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run." />
    <node id=" together. It had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.&#10; &#10; Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree, a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of dangers met and passed.&#10; &#10; Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.&#10; &#10; He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did you need?&#10; &#10; It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.&#10; &#10; In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake in adapting to the automation of the second" />
    <node id=" &quot;I cried when they gave you that antique watch,&quot; she said, her tone such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having met him.&#10; &#10; Si Pond was surprised. &quot;Cried?&quot; he said. &quot;Well, why? I was kind of bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Academician Gubelin?&quot; she said. &quot;You just call him Doc ?&quot;&#10; &#10; Si was expansive. &quot;Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like that. But how come you cried?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her, as though avoiding his face. &quot;I ... I suppose it was that speech Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the planets....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; Si said modestly, &quot;two of my runs were only to the Moon.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... and he said all" />
    <node id="ing Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned up at all.&#10; &#10; In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.&#10; &#10; The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards. But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.&#10; &#10; He'd had plenty of time to figure" />

You know what one of those spaceships costs?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Funny?&quot; she said. &quot;Why, I don't think it's funny at all.&quot;&#10; &#10; Si said, &quot;Look, how about another drink?&quot;&#10; &#10; Natalie Paskov said, &quot;Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Si,&quot; Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. &quot;How come you know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like. Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of materials and all and keep the economy going.&quot;&#10; &#10; Natalie said earnestly, &quot;Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.&quot;&#10; &#10; Si chuckled. &quot;A real" />
    <node id="The Ultrawelfare State initially attempted to adapt to automation by reducing working hours and days, but this resulted in inefficiency. They then decided to let the technologically unemployed remain unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock providing unemployment insurance. A select few workers continued to work reasonable hours and years, with new employees being chosen through a draft lottery from the registered labor force. This system aimed to ensure that only those with industrial aptitude were selected for jobs, while others could enjoy their Inalienable Basic shares, which provided them with sufficient income for food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education." />
    <node id=" for the labor force.&#10; &#10; In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution. They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week. It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none of them ever really becoming efficient.&#10; &#10; The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees were needed, a draft lottery was held.&#10; &#10; All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you were drawn, you must need serve.

Born in our Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food, clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well. He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he made his six trips. He" />

But nothing but the best.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided. A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations, titles.&#10; &#10; Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the screen and said, &quot;Balance check, please.&quot;&#10; &#10; In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, &quot;Ten shares of Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.&quot; The screen went dead.&#10; " />

We didn't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our ancestors did?&quot;&#10; &#10; Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea and tequila. He said, &quot;Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous pastimes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. &quot;Face reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more than is to be found there" />
    <node id="The speakers, Lofting Gubelin and Hans Girard-Perregaux, are not criticizing the current generation as a whole, but are specifically targeting Seymour Pond, a retired space pilot. They acknowledge that they themselves, along with most people, including Seymour Pond, tend to choose the least dangerous path and seek comfort over adventure. Their criticism is aimed at Pond's lack of willingness to continue his duties as a space pilot, despite the importance of their mission and the urgent need for more brave young men to take up such roles. They are disappointed that Seymour Pond has chosen to retire and enjoy the comfort of his home rather than face the dangers and challenges of space exploration." />
    <node id=", which, of course, required long years of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to our pleas for a few more trips?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that, seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken man.&#10; &#10; He said, &quot;No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one need face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.&quot;&#10; &#10; His friend and colleague changed" />
    <node id=" worn facial hair, had he but a touch more courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under the Ultrawelfare State.&#10; &#10; Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home, Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, &quot;Any more bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have miserably failed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Girard-Perregaux said easily, &quot;I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy. In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has been trained. There aren't two men on North America—there aren't two men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our delving into space.&quot; Gubelin snapped his fingers. &quot;Like that, either of us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the road to his destiny.&quot;&#10; &#10; His friend said drily, &quot;Either of us could" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now we are getting to matters.&quot; Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement. Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. &quot;And do not the ends justify the means?&quot;&#10; &#10; Gubelin blinked at him.&#10; &#10; The other chuckled. &quot;The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read of the sailor and his way of life?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to do with it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points, tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out for years" />
    <node id="The protagonist, Si Pond, plans to take an extended break after retiring from his job as a space pilot. He intends to spend his time indulging in luxury and pleasure, focusing on &quot;wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The works. But nothing but the best.&quot; This is a significant shift from his past experiences with leisure, where he would often end up spending all of his money in a short amount of time on drinking and questionable companionship. Si's new plan reflects his desire to enjoy the finer things in life and make the most of his retirement funds. He also wants to experience true luxury, as seen in his actions such as choosing an expensive hotel suite and traveling to Manhattan for his leisure activities." />
    <node id=" and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.&quot;&#10; &#10; Gubelin grunted bitterly. &quot;Unfortunately, our present-day sailor can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.&quot;&#10; &#10; He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his universal credit card. &quot;The ultimate means of exchange,&quot; he grunted.&#10;&quot;Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it, nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever our present-day sailor" />
    <node id=" by ear. You started off with a few drinks, fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.&#10; &#10; Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long denied him.&#10; &#10; Si was going to do it differently this time.&#10; &#10; Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The works. But nothing but the best.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable retirement-" />
    <node id=" credit card within ten minutes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.&#10; &#10; He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that, he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.&#10; &#10; He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the mattress.&#10; &#10; He came back to his feet," />
    <node id=" hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.&quot; The screen went dead.&#10; &#10; One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.&#10; &#10; He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one place really made sense. The big city.&#10; &#10; He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He might as well do it up brown.&#10; &#10; He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his destination" />
    <node id="1. Similarity to a Sailor: The speakers compare Seymour Pond to a sailor, suggesting that his desires and behaviors are similar to those of sailors from the past. Just as sailors often dream of retiring to a peaceful life after years at sea, Si Pond dreams of retiring comfortably after his dangerous career as a space pilot.&#10;&#10;2. Lack of Spirit of Adventure: Girard-Perregaux argues that few people today have a strong spirit of adventure and are instead drawn to the least dangerous paths. He includes Seymour Pond in this category, suggesting that Pond's desire for retirement is not uncommon or unusual but rather reflects human nature's preference for safety and comfort.&#10;&#10;3. Justifying Bringing Him Out of Retirement: Understanding Seymour Pond as a modern-day sailor with natural tendencies towards safety and comfort helps contextualize his desire to retire. However, the speakers also emphasize that he is currently the only trained space pilot in the world, making him an essential resource for their organization's mission. Recognizing that Si Pond's retirement decision stems from common human desires for security allows the speakers to separate his personal choice from the broader needs of space exploration and justify bringing him out of retirement despite his wishes." />
    <node id=" are few who don't take advantage of the fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.&quot;&#10; &#10; His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. &quot;Let's leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been increasingly hard to come by—even though in our minds, Hans, we are near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space Exploration.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So....&quot; Girard-Perregaux said gently.&#10; &#10; &quot;So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now we are getting to matters.&quot; Gir" />
    <node id="1. The reason Si feels pressured into taking on more space runs is that he is currently the last man in the world trained to pilot a spacecraft. The Space Exploration Department is at risk of being dropped by the Appropriations Committee on the Economic Planning Board due to its high expenses. If Si refuses to take on more runs, the department will be left without a pilot, which could lead to its discontinuation.&#10;&#10;2. Si mentions that the cost of one of those spaceships is significant, but he doesn't provide an exact figure in the text. Therefore, I am unable to give a specific amount for how much one of those spaceships costs." />
    <node id="....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; Si said modestly, &quot;two of my runs were only to the Moon.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.&quot;&#10; &#10; Si grunted. &quot;Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job, it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop. So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those spaceships costs?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Funny?&quot; she said. &quot;Why, I don't" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Sure.&quot; He pointed at the lapel pin. &quot;You can't wear one unless you been on at least a Moon run.&quot;&#10; &#10; She was obviously both taken back and impressed. &quot;Why,&quot; she said,&#10;&quot;you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. &quot;Call me Si,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody calls me Si.&quot;&#10; &#10; She said, &quot;I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Si,&quot; Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the current sex symbols, but never in person. &quot;Call me Si,&quot; he said again.&#10;&quot;I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to if they say Seymour.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I cried when they gave you that antique watch,&quot; she said, her tone such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having met him" />
    <node id="The striking girl dressed in the latest Shanghai style that Si Pond can't stop staring at in the spacecraft bar is Natalie Paskov. She is impressed by Si Pond's status as a famous space pilot and reveals that she cried during his banquet when he was awarded an antique watch.

This was the sort of thing he'd dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to take a look at the others present.&#10; &#10; To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.&#10; &#10; He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked and then swallowed.&#10; &#10; &quot; Zo-ro-as-ter ,&quot; he breathed.&#10; &#10; She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her eyes.

    <node id="&quot;Space cafard&quot; is a term that refers to the feelings of isolation, boredom, and anxiety experienced by space travelers during their missions. It's mentioned that the Space Exploration Department tends to downplay or hide this aspect from the public. In Si Pond's case, experiencing &quot;space cafard&quot; during his first run made him lose interest in space exploration. The term is not explicitly defined in the text, but based on Si's description and its context, it describes a form of psychological distress that can affect individuals involved in space travel." />
    <node id=" a child. I suppose you'd say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.&quot;&#10; &#10; Si chuckled. &quot;A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.&quot;&#10; &#10; She frowned. &quot;I don't believe I know much about that.&quot;&#10; &#10; Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. &quot;Old Gubelin keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard, but....&quot; Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back" />
    <node id="Loopting and Gubelin are criticizing themselves for not volunteering for pilot training forty years ago, which is when they could have made a difference in the current situation. They acknowledge that they, along with most people including Seymour Pond, tend to choose the least dangerous path and seek comfort over adventure. They are disappointed that Pond has chosen to retire and enjoy the comfort of his home rather than face the dangers and challenges of space exploration. The two friends recognize their own conformity to the present generation's preference for comfortable lifestyles and admit that they failed to bring history to bear on their problem, as evidenced by their lack of understanding of Seymour Pond's sailor-like tendencies and motivations." />
    <node id="The stunningly attractive girl that Si Pond couldn't help but stare at in the bar is named Natalie Paskov. She is dressed in the latest style from Shanghai and has cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her eyes. When she notices Si Pond staring at her, she looks at him coldly and turns away. However, after Si Pond explains his lapel pin, a symbol of having been on at least a Moon run, she reveals that she recognizes him as Seymour Pond, the famous space pilot. She mentions that she cried when he was awarded an antique watch during a banquet in his honor, indicating her admiration for him." />

He'd never been in a place like this, either. However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made his way to the bar.&#10; &#10; There was actually a bartender.&#10; &#10; Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an air of easy sophistication, &quot;Slivovitz Sour.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment. He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.&#10; &#10; Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd dreamed about, out there in the great alone," />
    <node id="1. The woman in the Kudos Room is named Natalie Paskov, and she is not explicitly described as being of Oriental descent. She is dressed in the latest fashion from Shanghai and has cosmetically altered her eyes to resemble a Mongolian fold, suggesting an interest or appreciation for Eastern culture rather than being of Eastern origin.&#10;2. After noticing Si Pond staring at her, she initially looks at him coldly and ignores him. However, after Si explains his lapel pin, a symbol of having been on at least a Moon run, she reveals that she recognizes him as Seymour Pond, the famous space pilot.&#10;3. She is impressed by Si's status as a renowned space traveler and mentions that she cried during his banquet when he was awarded an antique watch, indicating her admiration for him.&#10;4.

    <node id="1. The &quot;Oriental girl&quot; that Si, a spaceman, meets in the Kudos Room is named Natalie Paskov. However, it is important to note that while she has cosmetically altered her eyes to resemble a Mongolian fold and is dressed in the latest fashion from Shanghai, there is no explicit description of her as being of Oriental descent.&#10;2. When Natalie first notices Si staring at her, she ignores him after giving him a cold look. However, once Si explains his lapel pin, a symbol of having been on at least a Moon run, she reveals that she recognizes him as Seymour Pond, the famous space pilot. She expresses her admiration for him, mentioning that she cried during his banquet when he was awarded an antique watch.&#10;3.

    <node id="1. Fear for his safety: After the tragic death of his companion Rod on a routine Moon run, Seymour Pond became aware of the dangers of his profession as a space pilot. This realization made him prioritize his safety and security, leading him to retire early.&#10;&#10;2. Limited emotional investment in his career: Si Pond views his job as a space pilot as more of an adventure than a career. He celebrates each return from a run, seeing it as a commemoration of dangers met and passed. This attitude makes it easier for him to detach emotionally from his profession and retire.&#10;&#10;3. Financial insecurity: Growing up in the Ultrawelfare State, Si Pond didn't see the value in excelling acadically and believed that his Inalienable Basic stock was enough to live on. However, after becoming a space pilot and making six trips, he might have realized that his Basic shares were not sufficient for a comfortable life, prompting him to retire with a limited crediting rather than risking his life further.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of deep-seated spirit of adventure: The speakers argue that few people today have a strong spirit of adventure and are instead drawn to the least dangerous paths. Seymour Pond is no exception, as he chooses comfort and safety over the challenges and dangers of space exploration.&#10;&#10;5. Guaranteed minimum income: As a citizen of the Ultrawelfare State, Seymour Pond was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb security by being issued a minimum number of Basic shares in society. This security, along with the limited crediting he received upon retirement, might have been enough for him to live comfortably without taking additional risks as a space pilot." />
    <node id="1. Disappointment with Seymour Pond's Retirement: Both Lofting Gubelin and Hans Girard-Perregaux are disappointed in Seymour Pond's decision to retire, as they believe his skills and experience as a space pilot are crucial for the ongoing mission of space exploration, especially given the urgent need for brave young individuals to take up such roles.&#10;&#10;2. Criticism of Their Own Past Decisions: Gubelin and Girard-Perregaux criticize themselves for not volunteering for pilot training forty years ago when they could have made a difference in the current situation. They recognize their own conformity to the present generation's preference for comfortable lifestyles, admitting they failed to understand Seymour Pond's sailor-like tendencies and motivations.&#10;&#10;3. Importance of Space Exploration: Both speakers emphasize the significance of continuing humanity's exploration of space, believing that it is crucial to prevent man from abandoning &quot;the road to his destiny.&quot; They are willing to give their lives for this cause, demonstrating their strong conviction in the importance of space exploration." />
    <node id="1. The story indicates that Natalie cried during the banquet when Si Pond received the antique watch as an honor for his contributions to space exploration. This emotional reaction is not directly linked to Si's attachment to the watch itself, but rather to her admiration for him and her interest in space travel.&#10;2. As a fan of Seymour Pond and someone who is intrigued by space exploration, Natalie may have been deeply moved by the symbolism of the antique watch as a representation of his achievements. The emotional significance of the moment, combined with Doctor Girard-Perregaux's speech highlighting Si's contributions to the field, could have prompted her tears.&#10;3. It is also possible that Natalie has personal reasons for being so emotionally invested in space exploration and the people who contribute to it. The story does not provide explicit information on why she cried, leaving it up to interpretation based on the context clues provided." />

    <node id="1. Realistic expectations: Lofting should face the reality that Seymour Pond is an average individual who prioritizes safety and comfort over adventure, which is evident in his decision to retire early after realizing the dangers of space exploration. Lofting should not expect more than what Pond is willing or able to give, considering his average abilities and risk-averse nature.&#10;&#10;2. Limited influence: Lofting played a role in convincing Seymour Pond to become a space pilot, but he cannot force Pond to continue his duties as a pilot if he is not inclined to do so. Lofting must accept that his influence over Pond has its limits and recognize that people have the right to make their own choices.&#10;&#10;3. Personal responsibility: Lofting should acknowledge his role in the current situation by admitting that he, too, could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago and made a difference. By recognizing his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;4. Generational shift: The Ultrawelfare State has created an environment where people prioritize comfort and safety over adventure and risk-taking. This cultural shift affects not only Seymour Pond but also Lofting and Girard-Perregaux, who must now face the consequences of this change in values. Understanding this generational shift can help Lofting better empathize with Pond's decision to retire and develop strategies for addressing the department's challenges.&#10;&#10;5. The importance of space exploration: Lofting should confront the reality that space exploration is crucial for human progress, and its abandonment would be detrimental to mankind's destiny. This urgency highlights the need to bring Seymour Pond out of retirement or find alternative solutions to address the lack of trained space pilots, ensuring the continuation of vital space expeditions." />

    <node id="1. Si Pond's belief in the institution of the spree is significant because it reflects his attitude towards work and life. He sees his job as a space pilot not as a career, but as an adventure or spree to be celebrated each time he returns from a run. This perspective makes it easier for him to retire, as he doesn't have a deep emotional investment in his profession beyond the thrill it provides.&#10;2.

By understanding his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;5. Realistic Expectations: Although Seymour Pond is an average individual who prioritizes safety and comfort over adventure, he should consider embarking on &quot;a few more trips&quot; out of a sense of duty to his country and the human race. Lofting should not expect more than what Pond is willing or able to give but recognize that people have the right to make their own choices. However, given the urgency of space exploration, it is essential to appeal to Pond's sense of responsibility and empathy for the broader needs of space exploration." />

    <node id="The Ultrawelfare State initially attempted to adapt to automation by reducing working hours and days, but this resulted in inefficiency. They then decided to let the technologically unemployed remain unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock providing unemployment insurance. A select few workers continued to work reasonable hours and years, with new employees being chosen through a draft lottery from the registered labor force. This system aimed to ensure that only those with industrial aptitude were selected for jobs, while others could enjoy their Inalienable Basic shares, which provided them with sufficient income for food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education.

Twenty-two others had taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.">

Similarity to a Sailor: The speakers compare Seymour Pond to a sailor, suggesting that his desires and behaviors are similar to those of sailors from the past. Just as sailors often dream of retiring to a peaceful life after years at sea, Si Pond dreams of retiring comfortably after his dangerous career as a space pilot.&#10;&#10;2. Lack of Spirit of Adventure: Girard-Perregaux argues that few people today have a strong spirit of adventure and are instead drawn to the least dangerous paths. He includes Seymour Pond in this category, suggesting that Pond's desire for retirement is not uncommon or unusual but rather reflects human nature's preference for safety and comfort.&#10;&#10;3.

However, the speakers also emphasize that he is currently the only trained space pilot in the world, making him an essential resource for their organization's mission. Recognizing that Si Pond's retirement decision stems from common human desires for security allows the speakers to separate his personal choice from the broader needs of space exploration and justify bringing him out of retirement despite his wishes.">

Fear for his safety: After the tragic death of his companion Rod on a routine Moon run, Seymour Pond became aware of the dangers of his profession as a space pilot. This realization made him prioritize his safety and security, leading him to retire early.&#10;&#10;2. Limited emotional investment in his career: Si Pond views his job as a space pilot as more of an adventure than a career. He celebrates each return from a run, seeing it as a commemoration of dangers met and passed. This attitude makes it easier for him to detach emotionally from his profession and retire.&#10;&#10;3. Financial insecurity: Growing up in the Ultrawelfare State, Si Pond didn't see the value in excelling acadically and believed that his Inalienable Basic stock was enough to live on. However, after becoming a space pilot and making six trips, he might have realized that his Basic shares were not sufficient for a comfortable life, prompting him to retire with a limited crediting rather than risking his life further.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of deep-seated spirit of adventure: The speakers argue that few people today have a strong spirit of adventure and are instead drawn to the least dangerous paths. Seymour Pond is no exception, as he chooses comfort and safety over the challenges and dangers of space exploration.&#10;&#10;5. Guaranteed minimum income: As a citizen of the Ultrawelfare State, Seymour Pond was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb security by being issued a minimum number of Basic shares in society. This security, along with the limited crediting he received upon retirement, might have been enough for him to live comfortably without taking additional risks as a space pilot.">

Realistic expectations: Lofting should face the reality that Seymour Pond is an average individual who prioritizes safety and comfort over adventure, which is evident in his decision to retire early after realizing the dangers of space exploration. Lofting should not expect more than what Pond is willing or able to give, considering his average abilities and risk-averse nature.&#10;&#10;2. Limited influence: Lofting played a role in convincing Seymour Pond to become a space pilot, but he cannot force Pond to continue his duties as a pilot if he is not inclined to do so. Lofting must accept that his influence over Pond has its limits and recognize that people have the right to make their own choices.&#10;&#10;3. Personal responsibility: Lofting should acknowledge his role in the current situation by admitting that he, too, could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago and made a difference. By recognizing his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;4. Generational shift: The Ultrawelfare State has created an environment where people prioritize comfort and safety over adventure and risk-taking. This cultural shift affects not only Seymour Pond but also Lofting and Girard-Perregaux, who must now face the consequences of this change in values. Understanding this generational shift can help Lofting better empathize with Pond's decision to retire and develop strategies for addressing the department's challenges.&#10;&#10;5. The importance of space exploration: Lofting should confront the reality that space exploration is crucial for human progress, and its abandonment would be detrimental to mankind's destiny. This urgency highlights the need to bring Seymour Pond out of retirement or find alternative solutions to address the lack of trained space pilots, ensuring the continuation of vital space expeditions.">

Personal responsibility: Lofting should acknowledge his role in the current situation by admitting that he, too, could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago and made a difference. By recognizing his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;4. Generational shift: The Ultrawelfare State has created an environment where people prioritize comfort and safety over adventure and risk-taking. This cultural shift affects not only Seymour Pond but also Lofting and Girard-Perregaux, who must now face the consequences of this change in values. Understanding this generational shift can help Lofting better empathize with Pond's decision to retire and develop strategies for addressing the department's challenges.&#10;&#10;5. The importance of space exploration: Lofting should confront the reality that space exploration is crucial for human progress, and its abandonment would be detrimental to mankind's destiny. This urgency highlights the need to bring Seymour Pond out of retirement or find alternative solutions to address the lack of trained space pilots, ensuring the continuation of vital space expeditions.">

Just as sailors often dream of retiring to a peaceful life after years at sea, Si Pond dreams of retiring comfortably after his dangerous career as a space pilot.&#10;&#10;2. Lack of Spirit of Adventure: Girard-Perregaux argues that few people today have a strong spirit of adventure and are instead drawn to the least dangerous paths. He includes Seymour Pond in this category, suggesting that Pond's desire for retirement is not uncommon or unusual but rather reflects human nature's preference for safety and comfort.&#10;&#10;3.

However, the speakers also emphasize that he is currently the only trained space pilot in the world, making him an essential resource for their organization's mission. Recognizing that Si Pond's retirement decision stems from common human desires for security allows the speakers to separate his personal choice from the broader needs of space exploration and justify bringing him out of retirement despite his wishes.">

Nobody gets quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long denied him.&#10; &#10; Si was going to do it differently this time.&#10; &#10; Nothing but the best.

The narrator suggests that Si plans to change his ways and indulge only in the finest luxuries during his next trip because of his past experiences with leisure. Si has a history of spending all his money in a short amount of time on drinking and questionable companionship, leaving him with nothing to show for it but a hangover. The narrator points out that this is a common experience for those who must leave their homes for distant lands and return only periodically, finding themselves trying to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long denied them in a hurried and often wasteful manner.&#10;2. Si himself recognizes this pattern and wants to do things differently during his retirement. He plans to take an extended break after retiring from his job as a space pilot and indulge in luxury and pleasure, but this time, he intends to focus on &quot;wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The works. But nothing but the best.&quot; This shift in approach reflects Si's desire to enjoy the finer things in life and make the most of his retirement funds by experiencing true luxury.&#10;3. Therefore, when Si checks into a luxurious hotel suite with impressive amenities such as an auto-dining table, autobar list, swimming pool, and adjustable bed, he is impressed because these features represent the epitome of luxury and comfort, aligning with his plan to indulge in pleasure and enjoy the finer things in life during his retirement.">

Limited influence: Lofting played a role in convincing Seymour Pond to become a space pilot, but he cannot force Pond to continue his duties as a pilot if he is not inclined to do so. Lofting must accept that his influence over Pond has its limits and recognize that people have the right to make their own choices.&#10;&#10;3. Personal responsibility: Lofting should acknowledge his role in the current situation by admitting that he, too, could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago and made a difference. By recognizing his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;4.

    <edge source="1. Fear for his safety: After the tragic death of his companion Rod on a routine Moon run, Seymour Pond became aware of the dangers of his profession as a space pilot. This realization made him prioritize his safety and security, leading him to retire early.&#10;&#10;2. Limited emotional investment in his career: Si Pond views his job as a space pilot as more of an adventure than a career. He celebrates each return from a run, seeing it as a commemoration of dangers met and passed. This attitude makes it easier for him to detach emotionally from his profession and retire.&#10;&#10;3. Financial insecurity: Growing up in the Ultrawelfare State, Si Pond didn't see the value in excelling acadically and believed that his Inalienable Basic stock was enough to live on. However, after becoming a space pilot and making six trips, he might have realized that his Basic shares were not sufficient for a comfortable life, prompting him to retire with a limited crediting rather than risking his life further.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of deep-seated spirit of adventure: The speakers argue that few people today have a strong spirit of adventure and are instead drawn to the least dangerous paths. Seymour Pond is no exception, as he chooses comfort and safety over the challenges and dangers of space exploration.&#10;&#10;5. Guaranteed minimum income: As a citizen of the Ultrawelfare State, Seymour Pond was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb security by being issued a minimum number of Basic shares in society. This security, along with the limited crediting he received upon retirement, might have been enough for him to live comfortably without taking additional risks as a space pilot." target="1. Realistic expectations: Lofting should face the reality that Seymour Pond is an average individual who prioritizes safety and comfort over adventure, which is evident in his decision to retire early after realizing the dangers of space exploration. Lofting should not expect more than what Pond is willing or able to give, considering his average abilities and risk-averse nature.&#10;&#10;2. Limited influence: Lofting played a role in convincing Seymour Pond to become a space pilot, but he cannot force Pond to continue his duties as a pilot if he is not inclined to do so. Lofting must accept that his influence over Pond has its limits and recognize that people have the right to make their own choices.&#10;&#10;3. Personal responsibility: Lofting should acknowledge his role in the current situation by admitting that he, too, could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago and made a difference. By recognizing his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;4. Generational shift: The Ultrawelfare State has created an environment where people prioritize comfort and safety over adventure and risk-taking. This cultural shift affects not only Seymour Pond but also Lofting and Girard-Perregaux, who must now face the consequences of this change in values. Understanding this generational shift can help Lofting better empathize with Pond's decision to retire and develop strategies for addressing the department's challenges.&#10;&#10;5. The importance of space exploration: Lofting should confront the reality that space exploration is crucial for human progress, and its abandonment would be detrimental to mankind's destiny. This urgency highlights the need to bring Seymour Pond out of retirement or find alternative solutions to address the lack of trained space pilots, ensuring the continuation of vital space expeditions.">

Criticism of Their Own Past Decisions: Gubelin and Girard-Perregaux criticize themselves for not volunteering for pilot training forty years ago when they could have made a difference in the current situation. They recognize their own conformity to the present generation's preference for comfortable lifestyles, admitting they failed to understand Seymour Pond's sailor-like tendencies and motivations.&#10;&#10;3. Importance of Space Exploration: Both speakers emphasize the significance of continuing humanity's exploration of space, believing that it is crucial to prevent man from abandoning &quot;the road to his destiny.&quot; They are willing to give their lives for this cause, demonstrating their strong conviction in the importance of space exploration." target="The protagonist, Si Pond, retires from his job as a space pilot due to the dangerous nature of his profession, which was highlighted by the tragic death of his companion Rod on a routine Moon run. This incident made Si realize the risks associated with his work and decide to retire early. &#10;&#10;Growing up in an Ultrawelfare State, Si and his contemporaries didn't see the value in excelling acadically because they believed their Inalienable Basic stock was enough to live on. Si adopted this mindset and had a casual attitude towards work, viewing his job as more of a spree or adventure rather than a career. This perspective, coupled with the realization that he might not have enough Basic shares to last him long after retirement, prompted Si to retire early and enjoy his life with the finer things.&#10;&#10;Regarding education, Si's past experiences and the attitudes of his contemporaries suggest that they didn't see the value in academic achievement due to the availability of basic resources provided by the Ultrawelfare State. This mindset contributed to Si's decision to retire early rather than strive for more in his career as a space pilot. The dangerous nature of his job, combined with his lack of deep emotional investment in his profession beyond the thrill it provided, made retiring an easier choice for him.">

    <edge source="1. Realistic expectations: Lofting should face the reality that Seymour Pond is an average individual who prioritizes safety and comfort over adventure, which is evident in his decision to retire early after realizing the dangers of space exploration. Lofting should not expect more than what Pond is willing or able to give, considering his average abilities and risk-averse nature.&#10;&#10;2. Limited influence: Lofting played a role in convincing Seymour Pond to become a space pilot, but he cannot force Pond to continue his duties as a pilot if he is not inclined to do so. Lofting must accept that his influence over Pond has its limits and recognize that people have the right to make their own choices.&#10;&#10;3. Personal responsibility: Lofting should acknowledge his role in the current situation by admitting that he, too, could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago and made a difference. By recognizing his own contribution to the present circumstances, Lofting can better understand the challenges faced by the Department of Space Exploration and take responsibility for finding solutions.&#10;&#10;4. Generational shift: The Ultrawelfare State has created an environment where people prioritize comfort and safety over adventure and risk-taking. This cultural shift affects not only Seymour Pond but also Lofting and Girard-Perregaux, who must now face the consequences of this change in values. Understanding this generational shift can help Lofting better empathize with Pond's decision to retire and develop strategies for addressing the department's challenges.&#10;&#10;5. The importance of space exploration: Lofting should confront the reality that space exploration is crucial for human progress, and its abandonment would be detrimental to mankind's destiny. This urgency highlights the need to bring Seymour Pond out of retirement or find alternative solutions to address the lack of trained space pilots, ensuring the continuation of vital space expeditions." target="1. National Interest: The man in question, Seymour Pond, is currently the only trained space pilot available, making him an essential resource for the organization's mission. By continuing his duties, he would be contributing significantly to national and global interests in space exploration.&#10;&#10;2. Urgency of Space Exploration: Space exploration plays a critical role in human progress, and its abandonment would have severe consequences for mankind's destiny. This urgency underscores the need for more brave individuals like Seymour Pond to take up challenging roles in space exploration.&#10;&#10;3. Generational Shift: The current generation, including Lofting Gubelin and Hans Girard-Perregaux, has been influenced by the Ultrawelfare State's values, which prioritize comfort and safety over adventure and risk-taking. Seymour Pond's decision to retire stems from these common human desires for security. Recognizing this generational shift can help contextualize his choice while highlighting the importance of finding alternative solutions to address the lack of trained space pilots.&#10;&#10;4.

Realistic Expectations: Although Seymour Pond is an average individual who prioritizes safety and comfort over adventure, he should consider embarking on &quot;a few more trips&quot; out of a sense of duty to his country and the human race. Lofting should not expect more than what Pond is willing or able to give but recognize that people have the right to make their own choices. However, given the urgency of space exploration, it is essential to appeal to Pond's sense of responsibility and empathy for the broader needs of space exploration.">

    <node id="&quot;Miss Crawley&quot; refers to an elderly lady and a key character in the narrative. She is known for her wealth, her patronage of Rebecca and Miss Briggs, and her forthcoming will that the family is eagerly awaiting.&#10;&#10;When Miss Crawley arrives at a certain location in a carriage, she appears to be ill, possibly due to overeating, as implied by the mention of a hot supper of lobsters. The carriage windows are shut, and a fat spaniel rests on her lap. When the vehicle stops, a large round bundle containing Miss Crawley is taken out and carried upstairs for medical attention. Her physician and medical man are called, and they prescribe medicines for her care.&#10;&#10;The next day, Captain Crawley rides up to inquire after her health, while Mrs. Bute Crawley arrives from Hampshire and is welcomed by Miss Crawley with pleasure. The two women plan a gossip session about the late Lady Crawley, funeral arrangements, and Sir Pitt's proposal to Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley's arrival in the carriage results in her receiving medical attention, visitors, and concern for her well-being from various family members and friends. This contrasts with another unnamed lady in the house, who is also ill but receives no attention or care, highlighting the difference in their social statuses." />

Rebecca used to&#10;mimic her to her face with the most admirable gravity, thereby&#10;rendering the imitation doubly piquant to her worthy patroness.&#10;&#10;The causes which had led to the deplorable illness of Miss Crawley, and&#10;her departure from her brother's house in the country, were of such an&#10;unromantic nature that they are hardly fit to be explained in this&#10;genteel and sentimental novel.  For how is it possible to hint of a&#10;delicate female, living in good society, that she ate and drank too&#10;much, and that a hot supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the&#10;Rectory was the reason of an indisposition which Miss Crawley herself&#10;persisted was solely attributable to the dampness of the weather?

The&#10;carriage windows were shut; the fat spaniel, whose head and tongue&#10;ordinarily lolled out of one of them, reposed on the lap of the&#10;discontented female.  When the vehicle stopped, a large round bundle of&#10;shawls was taken out of the carriage by the aid of various domestics&#10;and a young lady who accompanied the heap of cloaks.  That bundle&#10;contained Miss Crawley, who was conveyed upstairs forthwith, and put&#10;into a bed and chamber warmed properly as for the reception of an&#10;invalid.  Messengers went off for her physician and medical man.  They&#10;came, consulted, prescribed, vanished.  The young companion of Miss&#10;Crawley, at the conclusion of their interview, came in to receive their&#10;instructions, and administered those antiphlogistic medicines which the&#10;eminent men ordered.&#10;&#10;Captain Crawley of the Life Guards rode up from Knightsbridge Barracks&#10;the next day; his black charger pawed the straw before his invalid&#10;aunt's door.

The arrival of Mrs. Bute,&#10;which would not have caused any extreme delight at another period, was&#10;hailed with pleasure now; Miss Crawley being pleased at the notion of a&#10;gossip with her sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawley, the&#10;funeral arrangements pending, and Sir Pitt's abrupt proposal to Rebecca.&#10;&#10;It was not until the old lady was fairly ensconced in her usual&#10;arm-chair in the drawing-room, and the preliminary embraces and inquiries&#10;had taken place between the ladies, that the conspirators thought it&#10;advisable to submit her to the operation.  Who has not admired the&#10;artifices and delicate approaches with which women &quot;prepare&quot; their&#10;friends for bad news?

But when Amelia came down with her&#10;kind smiling looks (Rebecca must introduce her to her friend, Miss&#10;Crawley was longing to see her, and was too ill to leave her&#10;carriage)--when, I say, Amelia came down, the Park Lane shoulder-knot&#10;aristocracy wondered more and more that such a thing could come out of&#10;Bloomsbury; and Miss Crawley was fairly captivated by the sweet&#10;blushing face of the young lady who came forward so timidly and so&#10;gracefully to pay her respects to the protector of her friend.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a complexion, my dear! What a sweet voice!&quot; Miss Crawley said, as&#10;they drove away westward after the little interview.  &quot;My dear Sharp,&#10;your young friend is charming.  Send for her to Park Lane, do you&#10;hear?&quot; Miss Crawley had a good taste.  She liked natural manners--a&#10;little timidity only set them off.  She liked pretty faces near her; as&#10;she liked pretty pictures and nice china.  She talked of Amelia with&#10;rapture half a dozen times that day.  She mentioned her to" />

Briggs' weeping snuffle, and her&#10;manner of using the handkerchief, were so completely rendered that Miss&#10;Crawley became quite cheerful, to the admiration of the doctors when&#10;they visited her, who usually found this worthy woman of the world,&#10;when the least sickness attacked her, under the most abject depression&#10;and terror of death.&#10;&#10;Captain Crawley came every day, and received bulletins from Miss&#10;Rebecca respecting his aunt's health. This improved so rapidly, that&#10;poor Briggs was allowed to see her patroness; and persons with tender&#10;hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female,&#10;and the affecting nature of the interview.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley liked to have Briggs in a good deal soon" />
    <node id=" all the family were in a fever of&#10;expectation regarding the will, and Rawdon Crawley was making sure of&#10;at least forty thousand pounds before the commencement of the London&#10;season.  Mr. Crawley sent over a choice parcel of tracts, to prepare&#10;her for the change from Vanity Fair and Park Lane for another world;&#10;but a good doctor from Southampton being called in in time, vanquished&#10;the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her, and gave her sufficient&#10;strength to enable her to return to London. The Baronet did not&#10;disguise his exceeding mortification at the turn which affairs took.&#10;&#10;While everybody was attending on Miss Crawley, and messengers every&#10;hour from the Rectory were carrying news of her health to the&#10;affectionate folks there, there was a lady in another part of the&#10;house, being exceedingly ill, of whom no one took any notice at all;&#10;and this was the lady of Crawley herself.  The good doctor shook his&#10;head after seeing her; to which visit Sir Pitt consented, as it could&#10;be paid without a fee; and she was left fading away in her lonely&#10;chamber, with no more heed paid to her than to a weed" />
    <node id="The source of Rebecca's deep regret is the fact that she declined a marriage proposal from Sir Pitt Crawley, which was an offer of &quot;marvellous good fortune&quot; for her. Rebecca finds herself unable to accept this honorable and advantageous offer mainly due to her marital status. At the time of the proposal, Rebecca was already married to Major Dobbin's brother, Captain Rawdon Crawley, making it impossible for her to accept Sir Pitt Crawley's proposal.&#10;&#10;In the text, Rebecca reflects on her disappointment but ultimately recognizes that she cannot accept the offer due to her existing marriage vows. Instead, she decides to focus on the future and manage her current situation wisely. The passage suggests that Rebecca has a strong character who learns from past experiences and uses them to make better decisions for herself in the long run." />
    <node id="'s confidante too, master of her&#10;secrets, and seal-keeper of that young woman's conscience?&#10;&#10;Well, then, in the first place, Rebecca gave way to some very sincere&#10;and touching regrets that a piece of marvellous good fortune should&#10;have been so near her, and she actually obliged to decline it.  In this&#10;natural emotion every properly regulated mind will certainly share.&#10;What good mother is there that would not commiserate a penniless&#10;spinster, who might have been my lady, and have shared four thousand a&#10;year?  What well-bred young person is there in all Vanity Fair, who&#10;will not feel for a hard-working, ingenious, meritorious girl, who gets&#10;such an honourable, advantageous, provoking offer, just at the very&#10;moment when it is out of her power to accept it?  I am sure our friend&#10;Becky's disappointment deserves and will command every sympathy.&#10;&#10;I remember one night being in the Fair myself, at an evening party. I&#10;observed old Miss Toady there also present, single out for her special&#10;attentions and flattery little Mrs. Briefless, the barrister's wife,&#10;who is" />
    <node id="; so, having devoted only the proper portion of regret&#10;to it, she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future, which&#10;was now vastly more important to her.  And she surveyed her position,&#10;and its hopes, doubts, and chances.&#10;&#10;In the first place, she was MARRIED--that was a great fact.  Sir Pitt&#10;knew it.  She was not so much surprised into the avowal, as induced to&#10;make it by a sudden calculation. It must have come some day: and why&#10;not now as at a later period? He who would have married her himself&#10;must at least be silent with regard to her marriage. How Miss Crawley&#10;would bear the news--was the great question. Misgivings Rebecca had;&#10;but she remembered all Miss Crawley had said; the old lady's avowed&#10;contempt for birth; her daring liberal opinions; her general romantic&#10;propensities; her almost doting attachment to her nephew, and her&#10;repeatedly expressed fondness for Rebecca herself.  She is so fond of&#10;him, Rebecca thought, that she will forgive him anything: she is so&#10;used to me that I don't think she could be comfortable without" />
    <node id="&#10;remained half a minute longer at the keyhole!  Rebecca might, perhaps,&#10;have told more: but five minutes after Miss Briggs's arrival in&#10;Rebecca's apartment, Miss Crawley actually made her appearance&#10;there--an unheard-of honour--her impatience had overcome her; she could&#10;not wait for the tardy operations of her ambassadress: so she came in&#10;person, and ordered Briggs out of the room. And expressing her approval&#10;of Rebecca's conduct, she asked particulars of the interview, and the&#10;previous transactions which had brought about the astonishing offer of&#10;Sir Pitt.&#10;&#10;Rebecca said she had long had some notion of the partiality with which&#10;Sir Pitt honoured her (for he was in the habit of making his feelings&#10;known in a very frank and unreserved manner) but, not to mention&#10;private reasons with which she would not for the present trouble Miss&#10;Crawley, Sir Pitt's age, station, and habits were such as to render a&#10;marriage quite impossible; and could a woman with any feeling of&#10;self-respect and any decency listen to proposals at such a moment, when&#10;the funeral of the lover's deceased wife had not actually taken place?&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="'t tell you now,&quot; sobbed out Rebecca, &quot;I am very miserable. But&#10;O! love me always--promise you will love me always.&quot; And in the midst&#10;of mutual tears--for the emotions of the younger woman had awakened the&#10;sympathies of the elder--this promise was solemnly given by Miss&#10;Crawley, who left her little protege, blessing and admiring her as a&#10;dear, artless, tender-hearted, affectionate, incomprehensible creature.&#10;&#10;And now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful&#10;events of the day, and of what had been and what might have been. What&#10;think you were the private feelings of Miss, no (begging her pardon) of&#10;Mrs. Rebecca?  If, a few pages back, the present writer claimed the&#10;privilege of peeping into Miss Amelia Sedley's bedroom, and&#10;understanding with the omniscience of the novelist all the gentle pains&#10;and passions which were tossing upon that innocent pillow, why should&#10;he not declare himself to be Rebecca's confidante too, master of her&#10;secrets, and seal-keeper of that young woman's conscience?&#10;&#10;Well, then, in the first" />
    <node id=" Rebecca's stay in Hampshire,&#10;the eternal friendship had (must it be owned?) suffered considerable&#10;diminution, and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to&#10;threaten demise altogether.  The fact is, both girls had their own real&#10;affairs to think of: Rebecca her advance with her employers--Amelia her&#10;own absorbing topic.  When the two girls met, and flew into each&#10;other's arms with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of&#10;young ladies towards each other, Rebecca performed her part of the&#10;embrace with the most perfect briskness and energy.  Poor little Amelia&#10;blushed as she kissed her friend, and thought she had been guilty of&#10;something very like coldness towards her.&#10;&#10;Their first interview was but a very short one.  Amelia was just ready&#10;to go out for a walk.  Miss Crawley was waiting in her carriage below,&#10;her people wondering at the locality in which they found themselves,&#10;and gazing upon honest Sambo, the black footman of Bloomsbury, as one&#10;of the queer natives of the place.  But when Amelia came down with her&#10;kind smiling looks (Rebecca must introduce her to her friend, Miss" />
    <node id="Based on examples from history and human nature as presented in the text, the probability and legitimacy of Mr. Rawdon's marriage is reasonable and understandable. The narrative points out several instances of unexpected or unequal marriages, such as Lord Eldon making a &quot;runaway match&quot; and Achilles and Ajax both being in love with their servant maids. It also questions the expectation for a person to suddenly become prudent in matters of marriage.&#10;&#10;The text highlights that many wise and learned men have married individuals from lower social classes, suggesting that such marriages are not uncommon or illegitimate. Furthermore, the idea that &quot;people only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there would be!&quot; implies that hasty or unequal marriages are a natural part of human relationships and population growth.&#10;&#10;In Mr. Rawdon's case, his marriage to Rebecca seems to be driven by similar desires and motivations. His father, Sir Pitt Crawley, had shown an evident liking for Rebecca, which did not escape Rawdon's notice. Considering his father's character, Rawdon concluded that Mrs. Bute might want Rebecca to be ruined to prevent her from becoming Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;Thus, based on historical examples and the general tendencies of human nature presented in the narrative, Mr. Rawdon's marriage to Rebecca is portrayed as a probable and legitimate outcome resulting from their personal circumstances and desires." />

How many of the wise and&#10;learned have married their cooks?  Did not Lord Eldon himself, the most&#10;prudent of men, make a runaway match? Were not Achilles and Ajax both&#10;in love with their servant maids? And are we to expect a heavy dragoon&#10;with strong desires and small brains, who had never controlled a&#10;passion in his life, to become prudent all of a sudden, and to refuse&#10;to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind?  If people&#10;only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there would be!&#10;&#10;It seems to me, for my part, that Mr. Rawdon's marriage was one of the&#10;honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that&#10;gentleman's biography which has to do with the present history.

He knew the old&#10;gentleman's character well; and a more unscrupulous old--whyou--he did&#10;not conclude the sentence, but walked home, curling his mustachios, and&#10;convinced he had found a clue to Mrs. Bute's mystery.&#10;&#10;&quot;By Jove, it's too bad,&quot; thought Rawdon, &quot;too bad, by Jove! I do&#10;believe the woman wants the poor girl to be ruined, in order that she&#10;shouldn't come into the family as Lady Crawley.&quot;&#10;&#10;When he saw Rebecca alone, he rallied her about his father's attachment&#10;in his graceful way.  She flung up her head scornfully, looked him full&#10;in the face, and said,&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, suppose he is fond of me.  I know he is, and others too.

Rebecca said nothing.  She&#10;seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the family.  She left&#10;the room before Rawdon went away that day; but they met by chance&#10;below, as he was going away after taking leave, and had a parley&#10;together.&#10;&#10;On the morrow, as Rebecca was gazing from the window, she startled Miss&#10;Crawley, who was placidly occupied with a French novel, by crying out&#10;in an alarmed tone, &quot;Here's Sir Pitt, Ma'am!&quot; and the Baronet's knock&#10;followed this announcement.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear, I can't see him.  I won't see him.  Tell Bowls not at home,&#10;or go downstairs and say I'm too ill to receive any one.

    <node id="Sir Pitt Crawley made a proposal of marriage to Rebecca, who was a penniless governess at the time. However, she refused his offer due to her existing marriage to Captain Rawdon Crawley. This fact made it impossible for her to accept Sir Pitt's proposal, despite the marital status being something she had long suspected he felt partial towards her. Rebecca recognizes that declining such a prestigious offer is a significant loss, but she understands that her commitment to her current marriage vows restrains her from accepting. Instead, she decides to focus on managing her present situation wisely and turn her attention toward the future. The text suggests that Rebecca has a strong character who learns from past experiences and uses them to make better decisions for herself in the long run." />
    <node id=". Briggs&#10;and Firkin at the door opened the eyes of astonishment and the lips of&#10;wonder.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--refused,&quot; Rebecca continued, with a sad, tearful voice.&#10;&#10;&quot;And am I to credit my ears that you absolutely proposed to her, Sir&#10;Pitt?&quot; the old lady asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ees,&quot; said the Baronet, &quot;I did.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And she refused you as she says?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ees,&quot; Sir Pitt said, his features on a broad grin.&#10;&#10;&quot;It does not seem to break your heart at any rate,&quot; Miss Crawley&#10;remarked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nawt a bit,&quot; answered Sir Pitt, with a coolness and good-humour which&#10;set Miss Crawley almost mad with bewilderment.  That an old gentleman&#10;of station should fall on his knees to a penniless governess, and burst&#10;out laughing because she refused to marry him--that a penniless&#10;governess should refuse a Baronet with four thousand a year--these were&#10;mysteries which Miss Crawley could never comprehend.  It surpassed any&#10;complications of intrigue in her favourite Pigault le Brun.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm glad" />
    <node id="Based on Firkin's observations, Miss Sharp is a very charming and influential person who has managed to captivate all the men in the household, including Sir Pitt Crawley, Captain Crawley, and even Mr. Crawley. Firkin notes that everyone seems infatuated with her, and she has bewitched them all. This is surprising to Firkin because Miss Sharp was initially employed as a governess, but she has since risen in status and become an integral part of the household.&#10;&#10;Firkin is particularly surprised about Miss Sharp's condition because she had always considered her to be an outsider who did not belong in their world. However, she has now become so indispensable that even Miss Crawley, who initially disliked her, cannot do without her presence. Firkin attributes this change to some sort of bewitchment or enchantment that Miss Sharp has cast over everyone, making them all act irrationally and against their better judgment." />

At the end&#10;of half an hour, the meal over, Miss Rebecca Sharp (for such,&#10;astonishing to state, is the name of her who has been described&#10;ingeniously as &quot;the person&quot; hitherto), went upstairs again to her&#10;patient's rooms, from which, with the most engaging politeness, she&#10;eliminated poor Firkin. &quot;Thank you, Mrs. Firkin, that will quite do;&#10;how nicely you make it! I will ring when anything is wanted.&quot; &quot;Thank&#10;you&quot;; and Firkin came downstairs in a tempest of jealousy, only the&#10;more dangerous because she was forced to confine it in her own bosom.&#10;&#10;Could it be the tempest which, as she passed the landing of the first&#10;floor, blew" />

Briggs too well heard&#10;the creaking Firkin descend the stairs, and the clink of the spoon and&#10;gruel-basin the neglected female carried.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Firkin?&quot; says she, as the other entered the apartment. &quot;Well,&#10;Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Wuss and wuss, Miss B.,&quot; Firkin said, wagging her head.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is she not better then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She never spoke but once, and I asked her if she felt a little more&#10;easy, and she told me to hold my stupid tongue. Oh, Miss B., I never&#10;thought to have seen this day!&quot;  And the water-works again began to&#10;play.&#10;&#10;&quot;What sort of a person is this Miss Sharp, Firkin?

    <node id=" I can't be your wife, sir; let me--let me be&#10;your daughter.&quot;  Saying which, Rebecca went down on HER knees in a most&#10;tragical way, and, taking Sir Pitt's horny black hand between her own&#10;two (which were very pretty and white, and as soft as satin), looked up&#10;in his face with an expression of exquisite pathos and confidence,&#10;when--when the door opened, and Miss Crawley sailed in.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Firkin and Miss Briggs, who happened by chance to be at the&#10;parlour door soon after the Baronet and Rebecca entered the apartment,&#10;had also seen accidentally, through the keyhole, the old gentleman&#10;prostrate before the governess, and had heard the generous proposal&#10;which he made her.  It was scarcely out of his mouth when Mrs. Firkin&#10;and Miss Briggs had streamed up the stairs, had rushed into the&#10;drawing-room where Miss Crawley was reading the French novel, and had&#10;given that old lady the astounding intelligence that Sir Pitt was on&#10;his knees, proposing to Miss Sharp.

    <node id="&#10;&#10;If Rawdon Crawley had been then and there present, instead of being at&#10;the club nervously drinking claret, the pair might have gone down on&#10;their knees before the old spinster, avowed all, and been forgiven in a&#10;twinkling. But that good chance was denied to the young couple,&#10;doubtless in order that this story might be written, in which numbers&#10;of their wonderful adventures are narrated--adventures which could&#10;never have occurred to them if they had been housed and sheltered under&#10;the comfortable uninteresting forgiveness of Miss Crawley.&#10;&#10;Under Mrs. Firkin's orders, in the Park Lane establishment, was a young&#10;woman from Hampshire, whose business it was, among other duties, to&#10;knock at Miss Sharp's door with that jug of hot water which Firkin&#10;would rather have perished than have presented to the intruder.  This&#10;girl, bred on the family estate, had a brother in Captain Crawley's&#10;troop, and if the truth were known, I daresay it would come out that&#10;she was aware of certain arrangements, which have a great deal to do&#10;with this history.

The letter she wrote indicates that their relationship has come to an end, as she absolves him from something, which is left unspecified in the passage. Furthermore, Miss Crawley's refusal to see Osborne or open his letters suggests that she wants to cut off all contact with him, indicating a significant deterioration in their relationship." />
    <node id=" very evening Amelia wrote him the tenderest of long letters. Her&#10;heart was overflowing with tenderness, but it still foreboded evil.&#10;What was the cause of Mr. Osborne's dark looks? she asked. Had any&#10;difference arisen between him and her papa? Her poor papa returned so&#10;melancholy from the City, that all were alarmed about him at home--in&#10;fine, there were four pages of loves and fears and hopes and&#10;forebodings.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor little Emmy--dear little Emmy.  How fond she is of me,&quot; George&#10;said, as he perused the missive--&quot;and Gad, what a headache that mixed&#10;punch has given me!&quot; Poor little Emmy, indeed.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley at Home&#10;&#10;About this time there drove up to an exceedingly snug and&#10;well-appointed house in Park Lane, a travelling chariot with a lozenge on&#10;the panels, a discontented female in a green veil and crimped curls on&#10;the rumble, and a large and confidential man on the box.

Look here!&quot; There&#10;was a little packet directed in the well-known hand to Captain George&#10;Osborne, and some things lying about--a ring, a silver knife he had&#10;bought, as a boy, for her at a fair; a gold chain, and a locket with&#10;hair in it.  &quot;It's all over,&quot; said he, with a groan of sickening&#10;remorse. &quot;Look, Will, you may read it if you like.&quot;&#10;&#10;There was a little letter of a few lines, to which he pointed, which&#10;said:&#10;&#10;My papa has ordered me to return to you these presents, which you made&#10;in happier days to me; and I am to write to you for the last time.

What mystery was there lurking?&#10;Oh, those women! They nurse and cuddle their presentiments, and make&#10;darlings of their ugliest thoughts, as they do of their deformed&#10;children.&#10;&#10;The gloom on the paternal countenance had also impressed George Osborne&#10;with anxiety.  With such eyebrows, and a look so decidedly bilious, how&#10;was he to extract that money from the governor, of which George was&#10;consumedly in want? He began praising his father's wine.  That was&#10;generally a successful means of cajoling the old gentleman.&#10;&#10;&quot;We never got such Madeira in the West Indies, sir, as yours.

    <node id="The country's and army's excitement over a military promotion has a relatively minor impact on George Osborne during this time. He is preoccupied with his new uniform, preparations for the march, and anticipating further promotion. When it comes to Mr. Sedley's bankruptcy, George shows little concern or empathy for the family's situation. In fact, he seems somewhat relieved that his connection to the Sedleys is broken off, as he had previously warned Amelia about getting involved with a man like her father. Overall, George's ambition and self-interest overshadow any emotions he might have for the Sedley family's misfortune." />
    <node id=" share of honour and distinction.&#10;&#10;The agitation thrilling through the country and army in consequence of&#10;this news was so great, that private matters were little heeded: and&#10;hence probably George Osborne, just gazetted to his company, busy with&#10;preparations for the march, which must come inevitably, and panting for&#10;further promotion--was not so much affected by other incidents which&#10;would have interested him at a more quiet period. He was not, it must&#10;be confessed, very much cast down by good old Mr. Sedley's catastrophe.&#10;He tried his new uniform, which became him very handsomely, on the day&#10;when the first meeting of the creditors of the unfortunate gentleman&#10;took place. His father told him of the wicked, rascally, shameful&#10;conduct of the bankrupt, reminded him of what he had said about Amelia,&#10;and that their connection was broken off for ever; and gave him that&#10;evening a good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in&#10;which he looked so well.  Money was always useful to this free-handed&#10;young fellow, and he took it without many words. The bills were up in&#10;the Sedley house," />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Of all Sedley's opponents in his debates with his creditors which now&#10;ensued, and harassed the feelings of the humiliated old gentleman so&#10;severely, that in six weeks he oldened more than he had done for&#10;fifteen years before--the most determined and obstinate seemed to be&#10;John Osborne, his old friend and neighbour--John Osborne, whom he had&#10;set up in life--who was under a hundred obligations to him--and whose&#10;son was to marry Sedley's daughter. Any one of these circumstances&#10;would account for the bitterness of Osborne's opposition.&#10;&#10;When one man has been under very remarkable obligations to another,&#10;with whom he subsequently quarrels, a common sense of decency, as it&#10;were, makes of the former a much severer enemy than a mere stranger&#10;would be.  To account for your own hard-heartedness and ingratitude in&#10;such a case, you are bound to prove the other party's crime.  It is not&#10;that you are selfish, brutal, and angry at the failure of a&#10;speculation--no, no--it is that your partner has led you into it by the&#10;basest treachery and with the most sinister motives.

Who has not remarked the readiness with which the&#10;closest of friends and honestest of men suspect and accuse each other&#10;of cheating when they fall out on money matters? Everybody does it.&#10;Everybody is right, I suppose, and the world is a rogue.&#10;&#10;Then Osborne had the intolerable sense of former benefits to goad and&#10;irritate him: these are always a cause of hostility aggravated.&#10;Finally, he had to break off the match between Sedley's daughter and&#10;his son; and as it had gone very far indeed, and as the poor girl's&#10;happiness and perhaps character were compromised, it was necessary to&#10;show the strongest reasons for the rupture, and for John Osborne to&#10;prove John Sedley to be a very bad character indeed.&#10;&#10;At the meetings of creditors, then, he comported himself with a&#10;savageness and scorn towards Sedley, which almost succeeded in breaking&#10;the heart of that ruined bankrupt man.

I don't deny that&#10;Sedley made my fortune, or rather put me in the way of acquiring, by my&#10;own talents and genius, that proud position, which, I may say, I occupy&#10;in the tallow trade and the City of London. I've shown my gratitude to&#10;Sedley; and he's tried it of late, sir, as my cheque-book can show.&#10;George!  I tell you in confidence I don't like the looks of Mr.&#10;Sedley's affairs.

The tone of the letter suggests an affectionate relationship between Rebecca and Rawdon.&#10;3.

In the letter, Rebecca regrets having to decline an advantageous offer of marriage (presumably from Sir Pitt) due to her secret relationship with Rawdon. She expresses her disappointment, knowing that she could have been a rich lady, sharing four thousand a year.

Send for her and&#10;have her back; I desire that she come back,&quot; the old lady said.&#10;&#10;&quot;She decamped last night, Ma'am,&quot; cried Mrs. Bute.&#10;&#10;&quot;She left a letter for me,&quot; Briggs exclaimed.  &quot;She's married to--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Prepare her, for heaven's sake.  Don't torture her, my dear Miss&#10;Briggs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She's married to whom?&quot; cries the spinster in a nervous fury.&#10;&#10;&quot;To--to a relation of--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She refused Sir Pitt,&quot; cried the victim.  &quot;Speak at once. Don't drive&#10;me mad.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O Ma'am--prepare her, Miss Briggs--she's married to Rawdon Crawley.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Rawdon married Rebecca--governess--nobod-- Get out of my house, you&#10;fool, you idiot--you stupid old Briggs--how dare you? You're in the&#10;plot--you made him marry, thinking that I'd leave my money from him--you&#10;did, Martha,&quot; the poor old lady screamed in hysteric sentences.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Rebecca does not make a desperate plea to Sir Pitt after he offers her a chance to return to Queen's Crawley as a governess. Instead, she declines his offer by saying that she is married and cannot accept such a position due to private reasons and considerations of self-respect. She then shifts her attention towards managing her present situation wisely and planning for the future, knowing that her marriage to Rawdon Crawley has significant implications for her financial security and social standing." />
    <node id="1. Rebecca (Becky) Sharp's experience of caring for Miss Crawley during her illness showcases Rebecca's ability to be patient, alert, and conscientious in difficult situations. Despite the challenges of dealing with a grumpy and demanding patient, Rebecca remained composed, never losing her temper or complaining about the situation.&#10;2. Rebecca's clear conscience allowed her to sleep lightly and be ready for duty at any time, making her an excellent caregiver during this trying period. She also managed to find uses for everything, demonstrating her resourcefulness and problem-solving skills.&#10;3. Rebecca's conduct during this time seemed to have improved Miss Crawley's opinion of her, as she became more fond of Rebecca and came to rely on her presence. This shift in their relationship highlights Rebecca's ability to adapt and make the best of difficult situations, even when initial circumstances are not in her favor.&#10;4. To handle this situation with patience, alertness, and a clear conscience, Rebecca would have had to practice active listening, empathy, and effective communication. She would need to anticipate Miss Crawley's needs, respond to them promptly, and ensure that she was providing the best care possible under the circumstances.&#10;5. Additionally, by maintaining her composure and not allowing herself to be flustered or overwhelmed by the challenges of caring for a sick patient, Rebecca demonstrated her resilience and adaptability in stressful situations. This experience further solidified her position within the household and showcased her capabilities as a competent and dedicated caregiver." />
    <node id=" the sick-chamber.&#10;&#10;She never told until long afterwards how painful that duty was; how&#10;peevish a patient was the jovial old lady; how angry; how sleepless; in&#10;what horrors of death; during what long nights she lay moaning, and in&#10;almost delirious agonies respecting that future world which she quite&#10;ignored when she was in good health.--Picture to yourself, oh fair&#10;young reader, a worldly, selfish, graceless, thankless, religionless&#10;old woman, writhing in pain and fear, and without her wig.  Picture her&#10;to yourself, and ere you be old, learn to love and pray!&#10;&#10;Sharp watched this graceless bedside with indomitable patience. Nothing&#10;escaped her; and, like a prudent steward, she found a use for&#10;everything.  She told many a good story about Miss Crawley's illness in&#10;after days--stories which made the lady blush through her artificial&#10;carnations.  During the illness she was never out of temper; always&#10;alert; she slept light, having a perfectly clear conscience; and could&#10;take that refreshment at almost any minute's warning.  And so you" />
    <node id=" last year.&quot;&#10;&#10;Captain Crawley looked savagely at the Lieutenant out of his little&#10;blue eyes, and watched him when he went up to resume his acquaintance&#10;with the fair governess.  Her conduct must have relieved Crawley if&#10;there was any jealousy in the bosom of that life-guardsman.&#10;&#10;When the young men went upstairs, and after Osborne's introduction to&#10;Miss Crawley, he walked up to Rebecca with a patronising, easy swagger.&#10;He was going to be kind to her and protect her.  He would even shake&#10;hands with her, as a friend of Amelia's; and saying, &quot;Ah, Miss Sharp!&#10;how-dy-doo?&quot; held out his left hand towards her, expecting that she&#10;would be quite confounded at the honour.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp put out her right forefinger, and gave him a little nod, so&#10;cool and killing, that Rawdon Crawley, watching the operations from the&#10;other room, could hardly restrain his laughter as he saw the&#10;Lieutenant's entire discomfiture; the start he gave, the pause, and the&#10;perfect clumsiness with which he at length condescended to take the&#10;finger which was offered for" />
    <node id="Based on the passage, the observations about Miss Sharp (also known as Rebecca) include her light and clear conscience, which allows her to sleep lightly and be alert, taking refreshment at any minute's warning. She appears fresh, neat, and trim in her dressing-gown and cap, or even in her smartest evening suit. The Captain, Crawley, is described as having fallen in love with her, a feeling he conveyed through uncouth convulsions to his aunt at the Rectory. He raves about Rebecca, perceiving her as clever, droll, odd, good-natured, simple, and kindly. The passage suggests that Crawley's affection for Rebecca has grown due to their proximity and frequent interactions, making him vulnerable to her charms.&#10;&#10;As for Captain Crawley's feelings towards Miss Sharp, the text indicates that he is infatuated with her after spending six weeks in close proximity. He confides in his aunt, Mrs. Bute Crawley, about his love for Rebecca, seeking advice and validation from his trusted relative. This revelation highlights the depth of Captain Crawley's feelings for Miss Sharp, as he feels comfortable sharing his emotions with his aunt." />
    <node id=" always&#10;alert; she slept light, having a perfectly clear conscience; and could&#10;take that refreshment at almost any minute's warning.  And so you saw&#10;very few traces of fatigue in her appearance.  Her face might be a&#10;trifle paler, and the circles round her eyes a little blacker than&#10;usual; but whenever she came out from the sick-room she was always&#10;smiling, fresh, and neat, and looked as trim in her little&#10;dressing-gown and cap, as in her smartest evening suit.&#10;&#10;The Captain thought so, and raved about her in uncouth convulsions. The&#10;barbed shaft of love had penetrated his dull hide.  Six&#10;weeks--appropinquity--opportunity--had victimised him completely.  He&#10;made a confidante of his aunt at the Rectory, of all persons in the&#10;world.  She rallied him about it; she had perceived his folly; she&#10;warned him; she finished by owning that little Sharp was the most clever,&#10;droll, odd, good-natured, simple, kindly creature in England.  Rawdon&#10;must not trifle with her affections, though--dear" />
    <node id=" reader of this little story who has not&#10;discernment enough to perceive that the Miss Eliza Styles (an old&#10;schoolfellow, Rebecca said, with whom she had resumed an active&#10;correspondence of late, and who used to fetch these letters from the&#10;saddler's), wore brass spurs, and large curling mustachios, and was&#10;indeed no other than Captain Rawdon Crawley.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Letter on the Pincushion&#10;&#10;How they were married is not of the slightest consequence to anybody.&#10;What is to hinder a Captain who is a major, and a young lady who is of&#10;age, from purchasing a licence, and uniting themselves at any church in&#10;this town?  Who needs to be told, that if a woman has a will she will&#10;assuredly find a way?--My belief is that one day, when Miss Sharp had&#10;gone to pass the forenoon with her dear friend Miss Amelia Sedley in&#10;Russell Square, a lady very like her might have been seen entering a&#10;church in the City, in company with a gentleman with dyed mustachios,&#10;who, after a quarter of an hour's interval, escorted her back to the&#10;hack" />
    <node id=", odd, good-natured, simple, kindly creature in England.  Rawdon&#10;must not trifle with her affections, though--dear Miss Crawley would&#10;never pardon him for that; for she, too, was quite overcome by the little&#10;governess, and loved Sharp like a daughter.  Rawdon must go away--go&#10;back to his regiment and naughty London, and not play with a poor&#10;artless girl's feelings.&#10;&#10;Many and many a time this good-natured lady, compassionating the&#10;forlorn life-guardsman's condition, gave him an opportunity of seeing&#10;Miss Sharp at the Rectory, and of walking home with her, as we have&#10;seen.  When men of a certain sort, ladies, are in love, though they see&#10;the hook and the string, and the whole apparatus with which they are to&#10;be taken, they gorge the bait nevertheless--they must come to it--they&#10;must swallow it--and are presently struck and landed gasping.  Rawdon&#10;saw there was a manifest intention on Mrs. Bute's part to captivate him&#10;with Rebecca.  He was not very wise; but he was a man about town, and" />
    <node id="The final event that caused the downfall of the Sedley family was a financial crash or ruin, which is implied to have been a result of poor investments or speculations. The narrative mentions that &quot;the final crash came&quot; and &quot;under which the worthy family fell,&quot; but it does not provide specific details about what led to this crash. The Sedleys had previously been living a peaceful and prosperous life in their opulent house, with no apparent financial difficulties. However, when the crash occurred, it had a significant impact on the family, causing them to fall into ruin and leading to their eventual departure from Russell Square. This event also led to the breaking off of the engagement between Amelia Sedley and George Osborne's son, as Osborne blamed Sedley for his actions and severed ties between the two families." />
    <node id=" he comported himself with a&#10;savageness and scorn towards Sedley, which almost succeeded in breaking&#10;the heart of that ruined bankrupt man.  On George's intercourse with&#10;Amelia he put an instant veto--menacing the youth with maledictions if&#10;he broke his commands, and vilipending the poor innocent girl as the&#10;basest and most artful of vixens. One of the great conditions of anger&#10;and hatred is, that you must tell and believe lies against the hated&#10;object, in order, as we said, to be consistent.&#10;&#10;When the great crash came--the announcement of ruin, and the departure&#10;from Russell Square, and the declaration that all was over between her&#10;and George--all over between her and love, her and happiness, her and&#10;faith in the world--a brutal letter from John Osborne told her in a few&#10;curt lines that her father's conduct had been of such a nature that all&#10;engagements between the families were at an end--when the final award&#10;came, it did not shock her so much as her parents, as her mother rather&#10;expected (for John Sedley himself was entirely prostrate in the ruins&#10;of his own affairs and shattered honour" />
    <node id="1. Her father, Mr. Sedley, has become preoccupied with his own financial struggles and bankruptcy, causing him to forget about Amelia's concerns. She cannot tell the old mother her doubts and cares as her mother is not a suitable confidante for such matters.&#10;2. The &quot;would-be sisters&quot; seem strange to her and she does not feel comfortable sharing her feelings with them.&#10;3. Amelia has misgivings and fears about George Osborne, but she dare not acknowledge them to herself and keeps them secret.&#10;4. She writes long letters to George every evening, expressing her love and concern for him, but he dismisses her concerns and focuses on his own headache from drinking mixed punch.&#10;5. Amelia's relationship with Miss Crawley, who she had previously received gifts from and may have had a close relationship with, has come to an end as Miss Crawley refuses to see Osborne or open his letters. This leaves Amelia without the support of her friend, further contributing to her loneliness and emotional struggles." />
    <node id=" that.  Inexpressible&#10;grief, and pity, and terror pursued him, and he came away as if he was&#10;a criminal after seeing her.&#10;&#10;When Osborne heard that his friend had found her, he made hot and&#10;anxious inquiries regarding the poor child.  How was she?  How did she&#10;look?  What did she say?  His comrade took his hand, and looked him in&#10;the face.&#10;&#10;&quot;George, she's dying,&quot; William Dobbin said--and could speak no more.&#10;&#10;There was a buxom Irish servant-girl, who performed all the duties of&#10;the little house where the Sedley family had found refuge: and this&#10;girl had in vain, on many previous days, striven to give Amelia aid or&#10;consolation. Emmy was much too sad to answer, or even to be aware of&#10;the attempts the other was making in her favour.&#10;&#10;Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne, this servant-maid&#10;came into Amelia's room, where she sate as usual, brooding&#10;silently over her letters--her little treasures.  The girl, smiling,&#10;and looking arch and happy, made many trials to attract poor" />
    <node id="1. Amelia wanted George to join them in the drawing-room because she hoped that his presence would lighten the mood and make the evening more enjoyable. She may also have wanted to spend time with him and grow closer as a couple.&#10;2. Amelia was worrying while she sat thinking because she had noticed Mr. Osborne giving her dark looks throughout the evening. She wondered if there was any disagreement between him and her father, and if so, what the cause of it might be. Additionally, she had received no response from George after playing his favorite waltzes, which made her suspect that something was wrong. All these factors contributed to her anxiety and foreboding during the evening." />
    <node id=" ladies had discussed the orange and the glass of&#10;wine which formed the ordinary conclusion of the dismal banquets at Mr.&#10;Osborne's house, the signal to make sail for the drawing-room was&#10;given, and they all arose and departed.  Amelia hoped George would soon&#10;join them there.  She began playing some of his favourite waltzes (then&#10;newly imported) at the great carved-legged, leather-cased grand piano&#10;in the drawing-room overhead.  This little artifice did not bring him.&#10;He was deaf to the waltzes; they grew fainter and fainter; the&#10;discomfited performer left the huge instrument presently; and though&#10;her three friends performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new&#10;pieces of their repertoire, she did not hear a single note, but sate&#10;thinking, and boding evil.  Old Osborne's scowl, terrific always, had&#10;never before looked so deadly to her.  His eyes followed her out of the&#10;room, as if she had been guilty of something. When they brought her&#10;coffee, she started as though it were a cup of poison which Mr. Hicks,&#10;the butler, wished to" />
    <node id=" be on the&#10;look-out.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, my boy,&quot; said Crawley, with a look of peculiar gratitude.&#10;&quot;You're wide awake, I see.&quot; And George went off, thinking Crawley was&#10;quite right.&#10;&#10;He told Amelia of what he had done, and how he had counselled Rawdon&#10;Crawley--a devilish good, straightforward fellow--to be on his guard&#10;against that little sly, scheming Rebecca.&#10;&#10;&quot;Against whom?&quot; Amelia cried.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your friend the governess.--Don't look so astonished.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O George, what have you done?&quot; Amelia said.  For her woman's eyes,&#10;which Love had made sharp-sighted, had in one instant discovered a&#10;secret which was invisible to Miss Crawley, to poor virgin Briggs, and&#10;above all, to the stupid peepers of that young whiskered prig,&#10;Lieutenant Osborne.&#10;&#10;For as Rebecca was shawling her in an upper apartment, where these two&#10;friends had an opportunity for a little of that secret talking and&#10;conspiring which form the delight of female life, Amelia, coming up to&#10;Rebecca, and taking her two little hands in" />
    <node id=" had not merely sent the piano; but had written a note&#10;to Mrs. Sedley, and asked permission to come and see her--and he had&#10;seen her, and Amelia too, yesterday, before he came down to Chatham;&#10;and, what is more, he had brought that farewell letter and packet which&#10;had so moved them.&#10;&#10;The good-natured fellow had found Mrs. Sedley only too willing to&#10;receive him, and greatly agitated by the arrival of the piano, which,&#10;as she conjectured, MUST have come from George, and was a signal of&#10;amity on his part.  Captain Dobbin did not correct this error of the&#10;worthy lady, but listened to all her story of complaints and&#10;misfortunes with great sympathy--condoled with her losses and&#10;privations, and agreed in reprehending the cruel conduct of Mr. Osborne&#10;towards his first benefactor. When she had eased her overflowing bosom&#10;somewhat, and poured forth many of her sorrows, he had the courage to&#10;ask actually to see Amelia, who was above in her room as usual, and&#10;whom her mother led trembling downstairs.&#10;&#10;Her appearance was so ghast" />
    <node id="uffy,&#10;solemn, and yellow at the best of times--and by the scowl and twitching&#10;of his black eyebrows, that the heart within his large white waistcoat&#10;was disturbed and uneasy.  When Amelia stepped forward to salute him,&#10;which she always did with great trembling and timidity, he gave a surly&#10;grunt of recognition, and dropped the little hand out of his great&#10;hirsute paw without any attempt to hold it there.  He looked round&#10;gloomily at his eldest daughter; who, comprehending the meaning of his&#10;look, which asked unmistakably, &quot;Why the devil is she here?&quot; said at&#10;once:&#10;&#10;&quot;George is in town, Papa; and has gone to the Horse Guards, and will be&#10;back to dinner.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O he is, is he? I won't have the dinner kept waiting for him, Jane&quot;;&#10;with which this worthy man lapsed into his particular chair, and then&#10;the utter silence in his genteel, well-furnished drawing-room was only&#10;interrupted by the alarmed ticking of the great French clock.&#10;&#10;When that chronometer, which was surmounted by a cheerful brass group&#10;of the sacrifice" />
    <node id="1. The new person who arrived is Sir Pitt Crawley.&#10;2. It became necessary to inform him about Miss Crawley's fainting fit because she is his sister, and he may have concerns for her health and well-being. Additionally, recent events involving Miss Crawley include the arrival of Rebecca Sharp's letter, which may affect Sir Pitt's family and finances, making it important for him to be informed of any significant developments concerning his sister." />
    <node id="Becky Sharp, formerly Rebecca, is now married to Rawdon Crawley. From the narrative, it can be inferred that Becky is playing a supportive role in Rawdon's life, helping him prepare for an impending crisis. The crisis at hand is Sir Pitt Crawley's anger upon discovering their secret marriage and his intention to disinherit Rawdon.&#10;&#10;Their meeting in private indicates that they are discussing this situation and planning their next steps together. Rawdon's readiness to follow Becky's orders shows that he values her advice and judgement, suggesting that she is assertive and resourceful in managing the crisis.&#10;&#10;Becky's true purpose in encouraging Mr. Crawley's affections earlier in the story was to secure a wealthy husband, ensuring her future financial security and social standing. However, now that she has married Rawdon, it seems her intentions have shifted towards helping him navigate this family conflict and protect his inheritance.&#10;&#10;Thus, Becky Sharp is playing a supportive role in Rawdon Crawley's life during this impending crisis, demonstrating their affectionate relationship while also working together to secure their financial future as a married couple." />
    <node id="1. Osborne and Captain Crawley have become friends, and Crawley has introduced Osborne to some young men of the first fashion, which has elated the simple young officer.&#10;2. During their conversation over wine, Osborne inquires about Miss Sharp and mentions Amelia Sedley, implying that he may have been previously acquainted with Miss Sharp or had some interest in her.&#10;3. Crawley looks savagely at Osborne when he mentions Miss Sharp's name, possibly due to jealousy or suspicion of Osborne's intentions towards her.&#10;4. When Osborne meets Rebecca Sharp again, he tries to be kind and protective towards her, but she greets him with a cool and killing nod, which makes him look foolish in front of Amelia.&#10;5. Later, Osborne cleverly confides in Crawley about his opinions regarding Miss Rebecca, suggesting that he sees her as a dangerous flirt, possibly out of spite or to make Crawley wary of her. However, Rebecca is made aware of Osborne's opinions before twenty-four hours are over, indicating that she may have heard about it through gossip or third-party sources." />

I know&#10;him; and Osborne's a goodish-looking fellow, with large black whiskers?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Enormous,&quot; Miss Rebecca Sharp said, &quot;and enormously proud of them, I&#10;assure you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Captain Rawdon Crawley burst into a horse-laugh by way of reply; and&#10;being pressed by the ladies to explain, did so when the explosion of&#10;hilarity" />
    <node id="Miss Crawley, a wealthy and independent woman, has an aversion to her brother Sir Pitt Crawley due to their differing social status and personalities. She is a liberal-minded individual who values her independence, while Sir Pitt is a traditional Baronet with four thousand a year who represents the conventional aristocracy that Miss Crawley disdains. Rebecca's surprise at Sir Pitt's arrival and her subsequent refusal of his marriage proposal further highlights their contrasting personalities and social standings." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the text, Amelia is engaged to be married to a man named Captain George Osborne. Rebecca Sharp initially describes him as a &quot;lanky gawky fellow&quot; who is in a line-regiment and has enormous black whiskers that he is proud of. Later, when talking to Rawdon Crawley, she identifies the man as Captain Dobbin. When introduced to Miss Crawley, Osborne is described as a young officer with &quot;goodish-looking&quot; features and large black whiskers by Captain Crawley, who knows him as a clumsy guardsman." />
    <node id="The Sedley family, after being forced by poverty to leave their opulent house in Russell Square, is now in a humble place of refuge. Mr. Sedley, who had kept his financial difficulties secret, is now harassed by creditors. The servants, including Amelia's maid and Black Sambo, have left the family to find better situations, except for honest old Mrs. Blenkinsop, who accompanied the Sedleys in their new home despite not receiving wages. She had amassed a considerable sum in their service and decided to stay with them.&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley and his family are dealing with their creditors by leaving their home and moving to a humbler place of refuge.

Instead, she declines his offer by saying that she is married and cannot accept such a position due to private reasons and considerations of self-respect.

The wages of those worthy people were&#10;discharged with that punctuality which men frequently show who only owe&#10;in great sums--they were sorry to leave good places--but they did not&#10;break their hearts at parting from their adored master and mistress.&#10;Amelia's maid was profuse in condolences, but went off quite resigned&#10;to better herself in a genteeler quarter of the town.  Black Sambo,&#10;with the infatuation of his profession, determined on setting up a&#10;public-house.  Honest old Mrs. Blenkinsop indeed, who had seen the&#10;birth of Jos and Amelia, and the wooing of John Sedley and his wife,&#10;was for staying by them without wages, having amassed a considerable&#10;sum in their service: and she accompanied the fallen people into their&#10;new and humble place of refuge, where she tended them and grumbled&#10;against them for a while.&#10;&#10;Of all Sedley's opponents in his debates with his creditors which now&#10;ensued, and harassed the feelings of the humiliated old gentleman so&#10;severe" />
    <node id="Becky Crawley, also known as Rebecca Sharp, maintained her allure and mystique while living at Brompton by being circumspect and modest in her interactions with the men she socialized with. She was well-aware of Crawley's reputation as a jealous warrior and used it to her advantage, ensuring that none of her male companions overstepped their bounds. Additionally, she never allowed her own guard to slip, keeping her past and true intentions hidden from them. The text also mentions that Becky was an excellent hostess, providing delightful little dinners, music, and cheerful conversation that no doubt added to her allure. Her skill in making punch and proficiency at piquet were also likely factors that helped maintain her mystique and kept the men charmed by her company." />
    <node id=" fortune. &quot;My relations won't cry fie upon&#10;me,&quot; Becky said, with rather a bitter laugh; and she was quite&#10;contented to wait until the old aunt should be reconciled, before she&#10;claimed her place in society.  So she lived at Brompton, and meanwhile&#10;saw no one, or only those few of her husband's male companions who were&#10;admitted into her little dining-room.  These were all charmed with her.&#10;The little dinners, the laughing and chatting, the music afterwards,&#10;delighted all who participated in these enjoyments.  Major Martingale&#10;never thought about asking to see the marriage licence, Captain&#10;Cinqbars was perfectly enchanted with her skill in making punch.  And&#10;young Lieutenant Spatterdash (who was fond of piquet, and whom Crawley&#10;would often invite) was evidently and quickly smitten by Mrs. Crawley;&#10;but her own circumspection and modesty never forsook her for a moment,&#10;and Crawley's reputation as a fire-eating and jealous warrior was a&#10;further and complete defence to his little wife.&#10;&#10;There are gentlemen of very good blood and fashion in this city, who&#10;never have entered a" />

A good housewife is of necessity a&#10;humbug; and Cornelia's husband was hoodwinked, as Potiphar was--only in&#10;a different way.&#10;&#10;By these attentions, that veteran rake, Rawdon Crawley, found himself&#10;converted into a very happy and submissive married man.  His former&#10;haunts knew him not. They asked about him once or twice at his clubs,&#10;but did not miss him much: in those booths of Vanity Fair people seldom&#10;do miss each other.  His secluded wife ever smiling and cheerful, his&#10;little comfortable lodgings, snug meals, and homely evenings, had all&#10;the charms of novelty and secrecy.  The marriage was not yet declared&#10;to the world, or published in the Morning Post.  All his creditors&#10;would have come rushing on him in a body, had they known that he was&#10;united to a woman without fortune. &quot;My relations won't cry fie upon&#10;me,&quot; Becky said, with rather a bitter laugh; and she was quite&#10;contented to wait" />
    <node id="Becky Sharp, or Rebecca, plays a supportive role in Rawdon Crawley's life during the impending crisis. She assumes a position of authority and resourcefulness by managing their situation and planning for their future together, demonstrating an affectionate relationship between them. This reflects the broader theme of gender roles and power dynamics as it challenges traditional expectations of women's submissiveness in the 19th-century context portrayed in the narrative. Instead, Becky exhibits agency, intelligence, and influence over Rawdon, who willingly follows her orders and recognizes her capabilities. This dynamic showcases a more complex and less rigid power structure within their marriage, which is an interesting departure from societal norms of the time." />

There was no need for him to put his letter into the&#10;third volume of Porteus.

    <node id="The text reveals that Rebecca, also known as Miss Sharp, has a strong character and the ability to make wise decisions, even when faced with difficult situations. When Sir Pitt Crawley offers her a chance to return to Queen's Crawley as a governess, she declines his offer by stating her private reasons and considerations of self-respect, showing that she values her dignity and is not easily swayed by materialistic gains.&#10;&#10;When it comes to her interaction with George (Captain Rawdon Crawley), the text suggests that Rebecca has gained the upper hand in their relationship. Despite being a penniless governess at the time of Sir Pitt's proposal, she refused his offer due to her existing marriage to Captain Rawdon Crawley, indicating that she values her commitment to her husband and her marriage vows. This decision may have been difficult for Rebecca, as she recognizes the significant implications of her marriage for her financial security and social standing.&#10;&#10;The text also suggests that George is infatuated with Rebecca after spending six weeks in close proximity. He confides in his aunt, Mrs. Bute Crawley, about his love for Rebecca, seeking advice and validation from his trusted relative. This revelation highlights the depth of George's feelings for Rebecca, as he feels comfortable sharing his emotions with his aunt.&#10;&#10;In response to Rebecca's assertiveness and strong character, George responds positively, expressing admiration and affection towards her. Despite their different social standings and contrasting personalities, they share a deep connection based on mutual respect and love. The text does not provide any indication that George tries to dominate or manipulate Rebecca, suggesting that he values her independence and strong character.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text reveals that Rebecca is a strong-willed and independent woman who values her commitments and makes wise decisions for herself. Her ability to gain the upper hand in her conversation with George indicates that she is confident and assertive, while George's positive response suggests that he admires and respects her for these qualities." />

In this case, it is revealed that Rose Dawson, the poor relation living with Sir Pitt, has passed away, and the hatchment was previously used for his late mother, the dowager Lady Crawley. The use of a hatchment as a funeral tribute is a tradition associated with the British aristocracy, reflecting the social status of the characters in the novel." />

    <node id="Becky Sharp, the former governess of the Sedley family, was attempting to purchase a piano at the bankruptcy sale of John Sedley's old house in Russell Square because the piano likely held sentimental value for her.

The butler of Mr. Osborne was present at the sale to buy some of the famous port wine for himself, and it is mentioned that there were also young stockbrokers buying silverware.&#10;&#10;Becky's presence at the sale, along with her attempt to purchase the piano, suggests that she may have been trying to acquire items that reminded her of the Sedleys or that held sentimental value for her.

    <node id="John Osborne's intense opposition towards Sedley during their debt debates can be attributed to several factors related to their personal history and connections. Firstly, as a former close friend and neighbor, Osborne may feel a heightened sense of betrayal and anger due to the financial obligations Sedley had towards him. This often leads individuals to exaggerate the other party's faults to justify their own actions.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Osborne is motivated by the need to prove Sedley's character as being severely flawed in order to end his son's engagement with Sedley's daughter. The deeper the relationship, the more intense the reaction; thus, a broken engagement would require a significant reason like accusing Sedley of being a bad character.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Osborne is likely influenced by the general suspicion and accusations that often occur between friends or honest men when they argue about money matters. This phenomenon is common as people tend to suspect foul play in financial disagreements, assuming their counterparts are cheating or have sinister motives. All these factors contribute to John Osborne's strong opposition towards Sedley during their debt debates." />

The text also mentions that Becky was an excellent hostess, providing delightful little dinners, music, and cheerful conversation that no doubt added to her allure.

The passage suggests that Rebecca has a strong character who learns from past experiences and uses them to make better decisions for herself in the long run." target="The text reveals that Rebecca, also known as Miss Sharp, has a strong character and the ability to make wise decisions, even when faced with difficult situations. When Sir Pitt Crawley offers her a chance to return to Queen's Crawley as a governess, she declines his offer by stating her private reasons and considerations of self-respect, showing that she values her dignity and is not easily swayed by materialistic gains.&#10;&#10;When it comes to her interaction with George (Captain Rawdon Crawley), the text suggests that Rebecca has gained the upper hand in their relationship. Despite being a penniless governess at the time of Sir Pitt's proposal, she refused his offer due to her existing marriage to Captain Rawdon Crawley, indicating that she values her commitment to her husband and her marriage vows. This decision may have been difficult for Rebecca, as she recognizes the significant implications of her marriage for her financial security and social standing.&#10;&#10;The text also suggests that George is infatuated with Rebecca after spending six weeks in close proximity. He confides in his aunt, Mrs. Bute Crawley, about his love for Rebecca, seeking advice and validation from his trusted relative. This revelation highlights the depth of George's feelings for Rebecca, as he feels comfortable sharing his emotions with his aunt.&#10;&#10;In response to Rebecca's assertiveness and strong character, George responds positively, expressing admiration and affection towards her. Despite their different social standings and contrasting personalities, they share a deep connection based on mutual respect and love. The text does not provide any indication that George tries to dominate or manipulate Rebecca, suggesting that he values her independence and strong character.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text reveals that Rebecca is a strong-willed and independent woman who values her commitments and makes wise decisions for herself. Her ability to gain the upper hand in her conversation with George indicates that she is confident and assertive, while George's positive response suggests that he admires and respects her for these qualities.">

Rebecca, who seeks financial security and social standing by encouraging Mr. Crawley's affections, would have recognized that Amelia and Rawdon Crawley are attempting to establish connections with the wealthy and influential Miss Crawley in order to improve their own situations.">

Rebecca (Becky) Sharp's experience of caring for Miss Crawley during her illness showcases Rebecca's ability to be patient, alert, and conscientious in difficult situations. Despite the challenges of dealing with a grumpy and demanding patient, Rebecca remained composed, never losing her temper or complaining about the situation.&#10;2. Rebecca's clear conscience allowed her to sleep lightly and be ready for duty at any time, making her an excellent caregiver during this trying period. She also managed to find uses for everything, demonstrating her resourcefulness and problem-solving skills.&#10;3. Rebecca's conduct during this time seemed to have improved Miss Crawley's opinion of her, as she became more fond of Rebecca and came to rely on her presence. This shift in their relationship highlights Rebecca's ability to adapt and make the best of difficult situations, even when initial circumstances are not in her favor.&#10;4. To handle this situation with patience, alertness, and a clear conscience, Rebecca would have had to practice active listening, empathy, and effective communication. She would need to anticipate Miss Crawley's needs, respond to them promptly, and ensure that she was providing the best care possible under the circumstances.&#10;5. Additionally, by maintaining her composure and not allowing herself to be flustered or overwhelmed by the challenges of caring for a sick patient, Rebecca demonstrated her resilience and adaptability in stressful situations. This experience further solidified her position within the household and showcased her capabilities as a competent and dedicated caregiver.">

He confides in his aunt, Mrs. Bute Crawley, about his love for Rebecca, seeking advice and validation from his trusted relative.

Rawdon's readiness to follow Becky's orders shows that he values her advice and judgement, suggesting that she is assertive and resourceful in managing the crisis.&#10;&#10;Becky's true purpose in encouraging Mr. Crawley's affections earlier in the story was to secure a wealthy husband, ensuring her future financial security and social standing.

Firstly, as a former close friend and neighbor, Osborne may feel a heightened sense of betrayal and anger due to the financial obligations Sedley had towards him.

It is also possible that she was there out of curiosity or to see what she could get for a low price due to the bankruptcy sale." target="John Osborne's intense opposition towards Sedley during their debt debates can be attributed to several factors related to their personal history and connections. Firstly, as a former close friend and neighbor, Osborne may feel a heightened sense of betrayal and anger due to the financial obligations Sedley had towards him. This often leads individuals to exaggerate the other party's faults to justify their own actions.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Osborne is motivated by the need to prove Sedley's character as being severely flawed in order to end his son's engagement with Sedley's daughter. The deeper the relationship, the more intense the reaction; thus, a broken engagement would require a significant reason like accusing Sedley of being a bad character.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Osborne is likely influenced by the general suspicion and accusations that often occur between friends or honest men when they argue about money matters. This phenomenon is common as people tend to suspect foul play in financial disagreements, assuming their counterparts are cheating or have sinister motives.

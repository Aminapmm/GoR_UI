    <node id=" Companion's master (Mr. Rochester) has previously experienced or loved a character that is clear-eyed, eloquent, with a soul made of fire, and a stable yet supple and consistent character. This character also possesses a heart and a soul, instead of just physical attractiveness. The companion (Jane Eyre) believes that she might come up to his difficult standard, but she is unsure if she has met those standards before in his eyes. She hopes to never become distasteful to him, and strives to be herself rather than attempting to be &quot;celestial&quot; or perfect. Later in the narrative, Mr. Rochester expresses his love for Jane, finding her pleasing and someone who can submit to him yet master him at the same time, which he finds irresistible." />
    <node id=" companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my&#10;dear master.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and&#10;yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_&#10;you--with truth, fervour, constancy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet are you not capricious, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I&#10;find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a&#10;perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,&#10;and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul&#10;made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once&#10;supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love&#10;such an one?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I love it now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult&#10;standard?&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I&#10;daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of&#10;pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little&#10;uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your&#10;guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I&#10;knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so&#10;discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be&#10;trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I&#10;suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,&#10;nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with&#10;him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, never mind that now,&quot; I interrupted impatiently; &quot;it is enough&#10;that all was right.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope all will be right in the end,&quot; she said: &quot;but believe me, you&#10;cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:&#10;distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are" />
    <node id=" angel,&quot; I asserted; &quot;and&#10;I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must&#10;neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get&#10;it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all&#10;anticipate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you anticipate of me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little&#10;while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and&#10;then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when&#10;you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I&#10;say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,&#10;or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned&#10;as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as&#10;a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my&#10;dear master.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Distasteful! and like you again!  I" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if&#10;it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen&#10;Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.&#10;&#10;While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it&#10;was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;&#10;and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and&#10;borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to&#10;look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;&#10;but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his&#10;affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer&#10;dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well&#10;become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.&#10;&#10;I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a&#10;brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to&#10;feel," />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;I love it now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult&#10;standard?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you&#10;seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I&#10;am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up&#10;my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is&#10;sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery&#10;beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that&#10;inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I&#10;was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You were, you little elfish--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those&#10;gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would&#10;no doubt by their severity" />

I know not what dress she had on: it was&#10;white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you see her face?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held&#10;it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and&#10;turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage&#10;and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how were they?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was&#10;a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll&#10;of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ghosts are usually pale, Jane" />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Jane Emerson uses her wit and intelligence, symbolized by &quot;the needle of repartee,&quot; to manage her interactions with Mr. Rochester. She does this by working him up to considerable irritation during their evening conferences, which causes him to become cross and crusty but also keeps him entertained. Jane's approach is assertive yet respectful, as she maintains her ground without sinking into sentimentality or allowing Mr. Rochester to dominate the conversation completely.&#10;&#10;Jane's strategy involves being deferential and quiet in other people's presence, while thwarting and afflicting Mr. Rochester during their private conferences. This approach allows her to maintain a certain distance from him, which is beneficial for both parties, as it prevents Mr. Rochester's despotism from going unchecked while also ensuring that Jane's independence and spirit are preserved.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Jane employs this strategy with the goal of being transparent about her character and intentions, giving Mr. Rochester ample opportunity to &quot;rescind&quot; their agreement if he so desires. By doing so, she demonstrates her integrity and commitment to honesty in their relationship, which ultimately strengthens their bond." />

I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a&#10;bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from&#10;the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that&#10;distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual&#10;advantage.&quot;&#10;&#10;From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,&#10;after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I&#10;got up, and saying, &quot;I wish you good-night, sir,&quot; in my natural and&#10;wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.&#10;&#10;The system thus entered on," />
    <node id=",&quot; in my natural and&#10;wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.&#10;&#10;The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of&#10;probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather&#10;cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently&#10;entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,&#10;while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,&#10;satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.&#10;&#10;In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any&#10;other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening&#10;conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for&#10;me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared&#10;before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as &quot;love&quot; and &quot;darling&quot; on&#10;his lips: the best words at my service were &quot;provoking puppet,&quot;&#10;&quot;malicious elf,&quot; &quot;sprite,&quot; &quot;changeling,&quot; &amp;c.

I was&#10;aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for&#10;the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible&#10;from terror.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who was with you when you revived?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in&#10;water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,&#10;and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,&#10;sir, tell me who and what that woman was?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be&#10;careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough&#10;handling.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the&#10;transaction actually took place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And your previous dreams, were they real too?

    <node id="--what did she do to me?&#10;what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her&#10;entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you&#10;ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long&#10;dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were&#10;figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of&#10;the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep&#10;such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I&#10;will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my&#10;solution of the mystery?&quot;&#10;&#10;I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:&#10;satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear&#10;so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented&#10;smile.

    <node id=" your princely&#10;extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I&#10;would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I&#10;smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your&#10;aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in&#10;the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the&#10;square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my&#10;low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could&#10;bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw&#10;plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,&#10;and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your&#10;wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a&#10;coronet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How well you read me, you witch!&quot; interposed Mr. Rochester: &quot;but what&#10;did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or&#10;a dagger, that you look so mournful now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no" />
    <node id="1. In the narrative, Jane compares Mr. Rochester to Hercules and Samson, legendary strongmen who were famously manipulated or controlled by their lovers (Hercules by Deianira and Samson by Delilah). This comparison serves to highlight Mr. Rochester's emotional vulnerability and susceptibility to Jane's influence. Despite his initial attempts to control or dominate the relationship, Jane's unique charm, intellect, and assertiveness have won him over, making him &quot;influenced&quot; and &quot;conquered.&quot;&#10;2. The comparison also serves to illustrate the power dynamics in their relationship. While Mr. Rochester is physically stronger and more experienced, Jane's character and wit have proven to be an equally formidable force. Her ability to engage him intellectually and challenge his preconceptions has ultimately captivated him, demonstrating that strength and influence can come in many forms.&#10;3. Furthermore, Jane's reference to Hercules and Samson highlights the potential consequences of such emotional entanglements. Both legendary figures faced significant adversity and loss as a result of their relationships, suggesting that Mr. Rochester and Jane's union may not be without its challenges and hardships. Despite this warning, Jane ultimately embraces her new identity as Mrs. Rochester, signifying her willingness to confront any obstacles that may come their way.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane comparing Mr. Rochester to Hercules and Samson emphasizes the power dynamics in their relationship, highlighting Mr. Rochester's emotional vulnerability and susceptibility to Jane's influence, while also alluding to potential challenges that may arise as a result of their union." />

Do you hear that?&quot;&#10;&#10;I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The&#10;feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than&#10;was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I&#10;think almost fear.&#10;&#10;&quot;You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so&#10;strange.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Mrs. Rochester,&quot; said he; &quot;young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax&#10;Rochester's girl-bride.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.

    <node id="!&quot; exclaimed I, nettled; &quot;he is nothing like my&#10;father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.&#10;Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-&#10;twenty.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it really for love he is going to marry you?&quot; she asked.&#10;&#10;I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my&#10;eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry to grieve you,&quot; pursued the widow; &quot;but you are so young, and&#10;so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is&#10;an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do&#10;fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or&#10;I expect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?--am I a monster?&quot; I said: &quot;is it impossible that Mr. Rochester&#10;should have a sincere affection for me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I&#10;daresay, is fond of you.

Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who&#10;made me the offer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you&#10;as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be&#10;the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my&#10;little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act&#10;in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.&#10;Were you jealous, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is" />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre's reaction to being called &quot;Jane Rochester&quot; and the news that she will become Mrs. Rochester in four weeks is one of shock and uncertainty. She describes the feeling as something stronger than joy, something that smote and stunned her, making her giddy and fearful. This reaction can be attributed to several factors: first, Jane has always seen herself as plain and unremarkable, so the idea of becoming Mrs. Rochester, the wife of a wealthy and charismatic man, is difficult for her to comprehend. Second, Jane values her independence and autonomy, and the prospect of being married and potentially losing some of that freedom is daunting. Finally, Jane has always been committed to being true to herself and not trying to be someone she's not, so the idea of becoming a &quot;court-lady&quot; or dressing up in finery is not appealing to her. All these factors contribute to Jane's complex and mixed feelings about the news that she will become Mrs. Rochester." />
    <node id=" a few words of congratulation; but the smile&#10;expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her&#10;spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.&#10;&#10;&quot;I feel so astonished,&quot; she began, &quot;I hardly know what to say to you,&#10;Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half&#10;fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never&#10;happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,&#10;that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat&#10;down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,&#10;as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that&#10;Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I&#10;really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month&#10;you would be his wife.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He has said the same thing to me,&quot; I replied.&#10;&#10;&quot;He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?&quot;" />
    <node id=" my&#10;Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will&#10;cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any&#10;longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I&#10;would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as&#10;myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,&#10;though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't&#10;flatter me.&quot;&#10;&#10;He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  &quot;This&#10;very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must&#10;choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four&#10;weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below&#10;yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief&#10;stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun" />

I gladly advanced; and it was&#10;not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,&#10;but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so&#10;well loved, so caressed by him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,&quot; said he: &quot;truly&#10;pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-&#10;seed?

    <node id=" The woman that Mr. Rochester keeps in his house is Grace Poole. He keeps her there because she is considered a strange being and has exhibited odd behavior in the past, such as when she likely entered Jane's room at night and caused the disturbance that tore Jane's veil. However, it should be noted that Grace Poole is not intentionally malicious; Mr. Rochester explains that she was probably not fully awake and may have been acting out of confusion or disorientation. The mystery surrounding Grace Poole adds to the gothic atmosphere of the novel and keeps readers in suspense about her true role in the story." />

Oh, to think what&#10;might have happened!&quot;&#10;&#10;He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could&#10;scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half&#10;reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman&#10;was--must have been--Grace Poole.

Mr. Rochester had himself written the&#10;direction, &quot;Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London,&quot; on each: I could not&#10;persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.

    <node id=" The speaker, Jane Eyre, acknowledges the potential dangers and hardships that may arise in her relationship with Mr. Rochester, as symbolized by the reference to Hercules and Samson's tumultuous love stories. However, she ultimately embraces these challenges and affirms her commitment to Mr. Rochester, expressing her joy and excitement about their future together. Jane's determination to be herself, rather than striving for perfection, and her desire to live with Mr. Rochester and share both happiness and hardships, demonstrate her positive attitude towards the future. She also asserts her individuality and independence by making it clear that she has no intention of dying with him, despite his previous mention of such an idea. Jane's commitment to Mr. Rochester is rooted in her love and devotion to him, which she expresses clearly and confidently throughout the passage." />

I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked&#10;of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan&#10;idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!&#10;Death was not for such as I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />

What do you fear?--that&#10;I shall not prove a good husband?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the&#10;new life into which you are passing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex&#10;and pain me.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, it seems unlikely that Jane can fully enjoy her good fortune without any concerns for Miss Ingram's feelings. Although Mr. Rochester assures Jane that Miss Ingram is not suffering, as her pride was the driving force behind their relationship and not genuine affection, Jane's compassionate nature may still make it difficult for her to be entirely free of worry.&#10;&#10;Jane has already shown a strong sense of empathy towards others, including Miss Ingram. Therefore, even if Mr. Rochester downplays the impact of his actions on Miss Ingram, Jane might still feel some degree of guilt or unease about the situation. However, it is important to note that this concern for others is a testament to Jane's kind and caring character, rather than a shortcoming.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, while Jane may experience some lingering concerns about Miss Ingram, she has expressed her love and commitment to Mr. Rochester, and it seems clear that they are destined for a future together." />

    <node id=" Mr. Rochester's actions towards Miss Ingram could be perceived as dishonest coquetry, which might cause her to experience feelings of abandonment and pain now that his attention is solely focused on Jane. Given Jane's compassionate nature, it is unlikely she can enjoy her good fortune without any concerns for Miss Ingram's feelings. However, this concern for others reflects positively on Jane's character rather than being a shortcoming. While Mr. Rochester believes that Miss Ingram's pride will prevent her from suffering, Jane's empathetic nature may make it difficult for her to be entirely free of guilt or unease about the situation." />

    <node id=" In this passage, Jane Eyre asks Mr. Rochester whom he is going to marry now because she wants to clarify his intentions towards her and their relationship. Given that Mr. Rochester had previously talked about his future wife dying with him, Jane understandably feels confused and concerned about what will happen next. She views his idea of dying together as a &quot;pagan&quot; concept, indicating her rejection of such a notion.&#10;&#10;Jane considers her question to be natural and necessary because she wants to ensure that Mr. Rochester's affections are directed towards her and not some other woman. By asking this question, Jane is asserting herself and making it clear that she has no intention of dying with him, as she values her own life and independence. She also wants to know whether Mr. Rochester still sees her as a potential partner or if he has changed his mind.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's question reflects her determination to be true to herself and her desires, even as she navigates the challenges of romantic relationships. Her straightforwardness and assertiveness demonstrate her positive attitude towards the future, as she embraces both its joys and hardships with confidence and courage." />

    <node id=" After falling from the ledge, the narrator, Jane Eyre, wakes up to find a mysterious figure in her room. This figure is not anyone she has seen before at Thornfield Hall, and it has a &quot;fearful and ghastly&quot; appearance with discolored skin, swelled black face, and red eyes. The figure removes Jane's veil from its head, rips it into two parts, and tramples on them. It then looks out of the window, returns to Jane's bedside, and glares at her before leaving the room.&#10;&#10;Jane is understandably frightened by this encounter, and Mr. Rochester, who she relates the incident to, offers a possible explanation. He suggests that Jane may have been in a state between sleeping and waking, causing her to perceive the figure as frightening and larger than it actually was due to her feverish state. Although Jane is not entirely satisfied with this explanation, she pretends to be to please Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;The mysterious figure who tore Jane's veil is later revealed to be Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's first wife, who has been living in secret in the attic of Thornfield Hall. Bertha's mental health had deteriorated significantly, and she was prone to fits of anger and violence. Her appearance and actions that night were likely a result of her instability, rather than any supernatural causes as Jane initially feared." />

I&#10;again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent&#10;forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my&#10;blood crept cold through my veins.

    <node id=" The transformation in the narrator's appearance and self-perception is a result of her emotional state after Mr. Rochester proposes marriage to her. Jane has been struggling with her feelings for Mr. Rochester, who she loves deeply but believes to be out of her reach due to their different social statuses. When he finally proposes to her, she is overwhelmed with emotions, including joy, fear, and disbelief.&#10;&#10;This emotional turmoil is connected to the passing storm and the anticipated meeting with Mr. Rochester because the storm represents the tumultuous nature of Jane's feelings and the uncertainty of her future with him. The storm also serves as a metaphor for the challenges and hardships that Jane knows will come with their marriage, as she acknowledges that human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world.&#10;&#10;However, despite these concerns, Jane ultimately embraces the transformation in her appearance and self-perception, expressing her joy and excitement about becoming Mrs. Rochester. This demonstrates her positive attitude towards the future and her determination to be true to herself and her desires, even as she navigates the challenges of romantic relationships." />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Jane Eyre proposes arranging her governess duties and interactions with Mr. Rochester by maintaining her usual schedule for another month and keeping out of his way during the day. She will continue to serve as a governess to Adele and only see Mr. Rochester in the evenings when he sends for her, allowing them both to maintain their independence and autonomy. This arrangement demonstrates Jane's commitment to being true to herself while also respecting Mr. Rochester's wishes. Additionally, it ensures that they can continue to have a relationship while maintaining appropriate boundaries and avoiding any appearance of impropriety. Overall, Jane's proposal reflects her desire for a balanced and sustainable relationship with Mr. Rochester, one that allows them both to be themselves and pursue their own interests while also enjoying each other's company." />

However, this joy is mixed with some uncertainty and fear, as she has just learned that she will become Mrs. Rochester in four weeks, and this news has made her feel something stronger than joy, something that has &quot;smote and stunned&quot; her. Nonetheless, Jane chooses to celebrate her happiness by sharing it with others, even if they are strangers, and by appreciating the beauty of nature around her." />

A beggar-woman and&#10;her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I&#10;ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some&#10;three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.&#10;The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so&#10;musical as my own rejoicing heart.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad&#10;countenance, and saying gravely--&quot;Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?&quot;&#10;During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her&#10;then.

    <node id=" In this passage, Jane's modest request to Mr. Rochester is for &quot;an easy mind, not crushed by crowded obligations.&quot; She asks him to agree to certain terms in their relationship, which she will determine, so that she can have peace of mind.&#10;&#10;Jane makes her petition in a way that amuses yet disarms Mr. Rochester through her use of wit and assertiveness. She playfully likens herself to a &quot;fire-spirit&quot; who glows with indignation when necessary, and she teases Mr. Rochester for his previous behavior towards Miss Ingram, which she considers dishonorable. Jane's straightforwardness and confidence in her interactions with Mr. Rochester demonstrate her positive attitude towards the future and her determination to be true to herself.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane uses humor and irony to disarm Mr. Rochester and make her request more palatable. She playfully threatens to &quot;stir up mutiny&quot; among his harem of admirers and to &quot;fetter&quot; him until he signs a charter granting them liberal terms. This approach is both amusing and assertive, as it allows Jane to maintain a certain distance from Mr. Rochester while also ensuring that her own independence and spirit are preserved.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's request for an easy mind and her use of wit and irony to make her petition demonstrate her positive attitude towards the future and her commitment to being true to herself, even as she navigates the challenges of romantic relationships.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there are a couple of reasons why Jane might feel melancholic despite her joy about marrying Mr. Rochester. One reason could be her concern for Miss Ingram, as mentioned earlier. Even though Mr. Rochester insists that Miss Ingram is not suffering, Jane's empathetic nature may still make it difficult for her to be entirely free of guilt or unease about the situation.&#10;&#10;Another possible source of Jane's melancholy could be her awareness of the challenges and hardships that might come with their marriage, as she acknowledges that &quot;human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world.&quot; This suggests that Jane may be feeling a sense of trepidation or anxiety about the future, despite her love for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;As for why Mr. Rochester seems apprehensive and impatient about Jane's melancholy, it is likely because he wants her to be happy and excited about their upcoming marriage. He may also be feeling some guilt or responsibility for any distress that she is experiencing, particularly if he knows that his actions towards Miss Ingram contributed to her feelings of abandonment and pain.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there are several possible sources of Jane's melancholy, it is important to note that she ultimately expresses her joy and excitement about becoming Mrs. Rochester. This suggests that despite any lingering concerns or anxieties, Jane is committed to her relationship with Mr. Rochester and ready to face the challenges of their future together." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, Jane's fear and unhappiness have been caused by her concern for Miss Ingram's feelings and her awareness of the challenges and hardships that might come with their marriage. She may feel guilty about the pain that Mr. Rochester's actions towards Miss Ingram have caused, and she may also be feeling anxious or apprehensive about the future.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester compares their relationship to that of a shepherd and a stray lamb because he sees himself as a protector and provider for Jane, who is vulnerable and in need of guidance. The metaphor suggests that Mr. Rochester feels a sense of responsibility towards Jane's well-being and happiness, and that he is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure her safety and comfort.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the comparison highlights the power dynamic between them, with Mr. Rochester as the more experienced and worldly figure, and Jane as the innocent and naive one. However, it's important to note that Jane is not a passive recipient of Mr. Rochester's care and protection; she is an active participant in their relationship, expressing her own desires and making decisions based on her own values and principles.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there are several factors contributing to Jane's fear and unhappiness, the narrative suggests that she and Mr. Rochester have a deep and committed relationship, with a strong foundation of love, respect, and mutual support." />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Jane Emerson uses several strategies to maintain a comfortable distance from Mr. Rochester while also expressing her genuine admiration for him. Firstly, she employs &quot;the needle of repartee,&quot; or wit and intelligence, during their evening conferences to keep him entertained and manage their interactions assertively yet respectfully. This allows her to maintain her ground without sinking into sentimentality or allowing Mr. Rochester to dominate the conversation completely.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane's approach involves being deferential and quiet in other people's presence while thwarting and afflicting Mr. Rochester during their private conferences. This allows her to maintain a certain distance from him, which is beneficial for both parties, as it prevents Mr. Rochester's despotism from going unchecked while also ensuring that Jane's independence and spirit are preserved.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, Jane makes a modest request for an easy mind, not crushed by crowded obligations, using wit and assertiveness to amuse yet disarm Mr. Rochester. She playfully likens herself to a &quot;fire-spirit&quot; who glows with indignation when necessary and teases Mr. Rochester for his previous behavior towards Miss Ingram, which she considers dishonorable. This approach is both amusing and assertive, as it allows Jane to maintain a certain distance from Mr. Rochester while also ensuring that her own independence and spirit are preserved.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Jane proposes arranging her governess duties and interactions with Mr. Rochester by maintaining her usual schedule for another month and keeping out of his way during the day. This arrangement demonstrates Jane's commitment to being true to herself while also respecting Mr. Rochester's wishes. It ensures that they can continue to have a relationship while maintaining appropriate boundaries and avoiding any appearance of impropriety.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's strategies reflect her determination to be true to herself and her desires while also expressing her genuine admiration for Mr. Rochester. Her straightforwardness and assertiveness demonstrate her positive attitude towards the future, as she embraces both its joys and hardships with confidence and courage." />

Wrapped up in a shawl, I still&#10;carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,&#10;however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,&#10;I must retain it.

    <node id="The protagonist, Jane Eyre, reacts to the changes in her relationship with Mr. Rochester with a mix of joy, concern, and assertiveness. She is happy about their deepening bond but worried about the impact of his actions on Miss Ingram. Jane's compassionate nature makes it difficult for her to be entirely free of guilt or unease about any pain Mr. Rochester's actions may have caused. However, this concern for others reflects positively on Jane's character rather than being a shortcoming.&#10;&#10;Jane asserts herself by asking Mr. Rochester whom he plans to marry, making it clear that she has no intention of dying with him. This question demonstrates her determination to be true to herself and her desires while navigating the challenges of romantic relationships. She values her own life and independence, and she wants to ensure that Mr. Rochester's affections are directed towards her and not someone else.&#10;&#10;Jane does not see herself as having a significant influence over Mr. Rochester, but rather views him as a more experienced and worldly figure who feels a sense of responsibility towards her well-being and happiness. She is an active participant in their relationship, expressing her own desires and making decisions based on her values and principles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's reaction to the changes in her relationship with Mr. Rochester reflects her positive attitude towards the future, as she embraces both its joys and hardships with confidence and courage. Her determination to be herself and assertiveness in navigating romantic relationships demonstrate her growth and development throughout the novel." />
    <node id=" Yes, in the passage, Mr. Rochester has asked Jane Eyre to marry him, and she has accepted his proposal. This is evident when Mrs. Fairfax asks Jane if it is true that Mr. Rochester has asked her to marry him, and Jane confirms it. Additionally, Mr. Rochester makes plans for their wedding and future together, indicating that Jane has agreed to become his wife." />
    <node id=" Mr. Rochester is proposing to take his future wife on a tour of Europe after their marriage, visiting various famous cities and regions such as Paris, Rome, Italian plains, and French vineyards. He refers to her as his &quot;treasure&quot; and &quot;sylph,&quot; indicating that she will be a source of delight and lightness in his life.&#10;&#10;Jane Eyre's response to this suggestion is one of excitement and anticipation, as she asks whether she will truly travel with him and see these sights. She recognizes the significance of this proposal, as it represents a major opportunity for her to experience new things and broaden her horizons.&#10;&#10;At the same time, Jane also asserts her individuality and independence, stating that she will not be an &quot;angel&quot; but rather remain true to herself. This reflects her determination to maintain her own identity and autonomy within the context of their relationship, even as she embraces the joys and challenges of married life with Mr. Rochester." />

This scene describes the moment when Mr. Rochester and Jane see each other after he has asked her to marry him, and he expresses his love and affection for her." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester led Jane to believe he had intentions of marrying Miss Ingram as a form of dishonest coquetry, likely to maintain the attention and interest of both women. This deception could have been driven by his ego or desire for excitement and conquest, rather than genuine affection for either party. It is also possible that Mr. Rochester himself was uncertain of his feelings until he spent more time with Jane and realized his love for her. Regardless of his motivations, this deceit caused pain and confusion for both Miss Ingram and Jane, showcasing the consequences of dishonesty in romantic relationships." />
    <node id=" In this passage from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Charlotte Bronte, Mr. Rochester has just proposed to Jane and she has accepted. He tells Jane that he will speak with Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, to explain the situation and clear up any misunderstandings, as she had seen Jane with Mr. Rochester the previous night and was likely surprised by their sudden engagement. Mr. Rochester also decides to take Jane to Millcote that day because he wants to spend time with her and make plans for their future together. He tells Jane that it would be better for Adele, a young girl who lives at Thornfield Hall and whom Jane has been caring for as a governess, not to join them on the trip as she might be a &quot;restraint&quot; on their time together. Mr. Rochester also insists on keeping Jane separate from others in order to maintain their relationship and avoid any outside interference or judgment." />

However, it is mentioned that she had been busy and happy the previous day, and she had given all her money to a beggar woman and her child in celebration of her happiness. When she returns to Thornfield Hall, she finds Mrs. Fairfax looking out of the window with a sad countenance and later learns that Mrs. Fairfax had seen Jane with Mr. Rochester the previous night and was likely surprised by their sudden engagement. It is possible that Jane is feeling distressed about the impending revelation of her relationship with Mr. Rochester to Mrs. Fairfax, as she values her respect and does not want to be misjudged by her. However, this is just a speculation based on the given passage." />
    <node id=" In the passage, Mr. Rochester does not specifically instruct Jane Eyre to take any measures for her safety that night after the mysterious figure visited her room. Instead, he offers a possible explanation for what Jane experienced, suggesting that she may have been in a state between sleeping and waking and saw the figure as larger and scarier than it actually was due to her feverish state. Although Jane is not entirely convinced by this explanation, she pretends to be to please Mr. Rochester. It is only later that Jane discovers the true identity of the mysterious figure as Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's first wife. Therefore, there were no measures instructed by Mr. Rochester for Jane's safety in the passage provided." />
    <node id="The speaker in this passage, Mr. Rochester, is being somewhat secretive about something that happened during his absence from the house the previous night. Jane Eyre notices his disturbed behavior and presses him to reveal what has happened, but he initially resists, saying that curiosity can be dangerous and that she should not inquire into it. However, after some back-and-forth, Mr. Rochester eventually agrees to satisfy Jane's curiosity, although the text does not provide explicit details about what he reveals.&#10;&#10;The reason for Mr. Rochester's initial reluctance to reveal what happened is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it is possible that he is trying to protect Jane from some danger or harm. Alternatively, he may be feeling guilty or ashamed about something that occurred during his absence, and does not want to disclose it to Jane. The text does not provide enough information to say for certain why Mr. Rochester is being secretive, but it is clear that there is some mystery surrounding his behavior that Jane is trying to uncover." />

She is eager to embark on her new life with Mr. Rochester, but is also aware of the potential challenges and hardships that may lie ahead." />
    <node id=" Jane's comparison of Mr. Rochester to Hercules and Samson suggests that she sees his infatuation with her as a sign of emotional vulnerability and susceptibility to her influence. By drawing parallels between Mr. Rochester and these legendary strongmen who were manipulated or controlled by their lovers, Jane highlights the power dynamics in their relationship and emphasizes that strength and influence can come in many forms. This comparison also alludes to potential challenges that may arise as a result of their union, indicating that Jane is aware of the possible consequences of such emotional entanglements.

She describes the feeling as something stronger than joy, something that smote and stunned her, making her giddy and fearful. This reaction can be attributed to several factors: first, Jane has always seen herself as plain and unremarkable, so the idea of becoming Mrs. Rochester, the wife of a wealthy and charismatic man, is difficult for her to comprehend. Second, Jane values her independence and autonomy, and the prospect of being married and potentially losing some of that freedom is daunting. Finally, Jane has always been committed to being true to herself and not trying to be someone she's not, so the idea of becoming a &quot;court-lady&quot; or dressing up in finery is not appealing to her.

In the narrative, Jane compares Mr. Rochester to Hercules and Samson, legendary strongmen who were famously manipulated or controlled by their lovers (Hercules by Deianira and Samson by Delilah). This comparison serves to highlight Mr. Rochester's emotional vulnerability and susceptibility to Jane's influence. Despite his initial attempts to control or dominate the relationship, Jane's unique charm, intellect, and assertiveness have won him over, making him &quot;influenced&quot; and &quot;conquered.&quot;&#10;2. The comparison also serves to illustrate the power dynamics in their relationship.

Instead, he offers a possible explanation for what Jane experienced, suggesting that she may have been in a state between sleeping and waking and saw the figure as larger and scarier than it actually was due to her feverish state. Although Jane is not entirely convinced by this explanation, she pretends to be to please Mr. Rochester. It is only later that Jane discovers the true identity of the mysterious figure as Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's first wife. Therefore, there were no measures instructed by Mr. Rochester for Jane's safety in the passage provided.">

    <edge source=" The transformation in the narrator's appearance and self-perception is a result of her emotional state after Mr. Rochester proposes marriage to her. Jane has been struggling with her feelings for Mr. Rochester, who she loves deeply but believes to be out of her reach due to their different social statuses. When he finally proposes to her, she is overwhelmed with emotions, including joy, fear, and disbelief.&#10;&#10;This emotional turmoil is connected to the passing storm and the anticipated meeting with Mr. Rochester because the storm represents the tumultuous nature of Jane's feelings and the uncertainty of her future with him. The storm also serves as a metaphor for the challenges and hardships that Jane knows will come with their marriage, as she acknowledges that human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world.&#10;&#10;However, despite these concerns, Jane ultimately embraces the transformation in her appearance and self-perception, expressing her joy and excitement about becoming Mrs. Rochester. This demonstrates her positive attitude towards the future and her determination to be true to herself and her desires, even as she navigates the challenges of romantic relationships." target="Based on the narrative provided, there are a couple of reasons why Jane might feel melancholic despite her joy about marrying Mr. Rochester. One reason could be her concern for Miss Ingram, as mentioned earlier. Even though Mr. Rochester insists that Miss Ingram is not suffering, Jane's empathetic nature may still make it difficult for her to be entirely free of guilt or unease about the situation.&#10;&#10;Another possible source of Jane's melancholy could be her awareness of the challenges and hardships that might come with their marriage, as she acknowledges that &quot;human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world.&quot; This suggests that Jane may be feeling a sense of trepidation or anxiety about the future, despite her love for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;As for why Mr. Rochester seems apprehensive and impatient about Jane's melancholy, it is likely because he wants her to be happy and excited about their upcoming marriage. He may also be feeling some guilt or responsibility for any distress that she is experiencing, particularly if he knows that his actions towards Miss Ingram contributed to her feelings of abandonment and pain.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there are several possible sources of Jane's melancholy, it is important to note that she ultimately expresses her joy and excitement about becoming Mrs. Rochester. This suggests that despite any lingering concerns or anxieties, Jane is committed to her relationship with Mr. Rochester and ready to face the challenges of their future together.">

She may feel guilty about the pain that Mr. Rochester's actions towards Miss Ingram have caused, and she may also be feeling anxious or apprehensive about the future.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester compares their relationship to that of a shepherd and a stray lamb because he sees himself as a protector and provider for Jane, who is vulnerable and in need of guidance. The metaphor suggests that Mr. Rochester feels a sense of responsibility towards Jane's well-being and happiness, and that he is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure her safety and comfort.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the comparison highlights the power dynamic between them, with Mr. Rochester as the more experienced and worldly figure, and Jane as the innocent and naive one. However, it's important to note that Jane is not a passive recipient of Mr. Rochester's care and protection; she is an active participant in their relationship, expressing her own desires and making decisions based on her own values and principles.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there are several factors contributing to Jane's fear and unhappiness, the narrative suggests that she and Mr. Rochester have a deep and committed relationship, with a strong foundation of love, respect, and mutual support.">

    <edge source=" In the passage, Mr. Rochester does not specifically instruct Jane Eyre to take any measures for her safety that night after the mysterious figure visited her room. Instead, he offers a possible explanation for what Jane experienced, suggesting that she may have been in a state between sleeping and waking and saw the figure as larger and scarier than it actually was due to her feverish state. Although Jane is not entirely convinced by this explanation, she pretends to be to please Mr. Rochester. It is only later that Jane discovers the true identity of the mysterious figure as Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's first wife. Therefore, there were no measures instructed by Mr. Rochester for Jane's safety in the passage provided." target="The speaker in this passage, Mr. Rochester, is being somewhat secretive about something that happened during his absence from the house the previous night.

However, after some back-and-forth, Mr. Rochester eventually agrees to satisfy Jane's curiosity, although the text does not provide explicit details about what he reveals.&#10;&#10;The reason for Mr. Rochester's initial reluctance to reveal what happened is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it is possible that he is trying to protect Jane from some danger or harm.

    <node id="1. Color Preferences: The design team is discussing using yellow as one of the colors for the product. This idea came from Marketing who mentioned &quot;some yellow&quot; in the content. Later, the Industrial Designer also brought up the idea of incorporating yellow and suggested that the color should be used not only in the LEDs but also to make the product more visible when lost.&#10;2. Flashing Standby Lights: The Industrial Designer introduced the suggestion of adding flashing standby lights to the design, as they had seen such a feature on Samsung products. This idea is aimed at making the product more noticeable and easier to find when it's not in use or misplaced.&#10;3. Alternative Designs: There are discussions about exploring different designs for the product. The Industrial Designer mentioned thinking of &quot;totally different designs&quot; and also brought up a previous concept reminiscent of a Gameboy.&#10;4. Interaction Sensors: While the exact nature of these sensors is unclear from the transcript, they were mentioned in passing during the discussion.&#10;5. Real Remote Name: Although not directly related to design ideas, it's worth noting that the Project Manager suggested naming the product &quot;The Real Remote,&quot; which might influence branding and aesthetics." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide clear information on which specific components, chip type, or case material have been decided for the project. However, it is mentioned that the team has chosen kinetic as the energy source and a doubly curved case. The reason behind choosing a kinetic energy source is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but there are some implications suggesting its potential benefits.&#10;&#10;The User Interface (UI) Designer expressed their initial preference for traditional batteries, which are easy to use and replace. However, the Industrial Designer brought up the idea of using kinetic energy, where the user has to move the device to generate power. This concept was discussed among the team members, with some expressing agreement on exploring it as an optional feature or even combining it with a battery as a hybrid solution. The Industrial Designer also mentioned that a kinetic energy source might be more expensive than other options.&#10;&#10;As for the case material, the doubly curved rubber case was chosen, and the Industrial Designer suggested using rubber materials for better durability and increased visibility of the product. This choice seems to be influenced by aesthetic preferences as well as functionality considerations. The team did not explicitly discuss why they chose a doubly curved case specifically, but it can be inferred that this design decision might contribute to a more ergonomic and visually appealing product." />

Uh {disfmarker} {gap} again . Ugh . {vocalsound} Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh the case would be doubly curved .

    <node id=" . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to .

    <node id="1. Rounded Rectangular Buttons: These buttons can have rounded corners while maintaining a rectangular shape, which could make them easier to distinguish from one another and provide a comfortable grip for users. The size of these buttons should be large enough to accommodate different thumb sizes and ensure easy interaction.&#10;&#10;2. Circular Buttons: Circular buttons with uniform diameter and spacing can create a clean, symmetrical look that is visually appealing and intuitive for users. Varying the size of certain circular buttons (e.g., larger &quot;home&quot; button) can help differentiate primary actions from secondary ones.&#10;&#10;3. Elliptical Buttons: Elliptical buttons can offer a compromise between rounded rectangular and circular shapes, providing a unique aesthetic that stands out from traditional designs. Like circular buttons, elliptical buttons can be varied in size to indicate importance or functionality.&#10;&#10;4. Custom Shapes: Based on the discussion about exploring alternative concepts like a Gameboy-like design, custom button shapes could be considered to create a distinctive and futuristic look. These shapes should still maintain ergonomic principles to ensure comfortable interaction and ease of use.&#10;&#10;5. Recessed Buttons: Recessed buttons can provide additional grip and help prevent accidental presses, making them suitable for busy environments or situations where users may be wearing gloves. However, recessed buttons might require more force to activate, so their design should account for this factor to ensure a smooth user experience.&#10;&#10;6. Raised Buttons: Conversely, raised buttons can offer better tactile feedback and be easier to locate by touch, which is especially useful in low-light conditions or for visually impaired users. The height of these buttons should be consistent and comfortable for users to press without causing discomfort or strain.&#10;&#10;When making a more curved product, it's essential to consider how button shapes and dimensions will integrate with the overall design. Curved surfaces might necessitate adjustments to button placement and size to maintain ergonomics and ease of use. Additionally, incorporating recessed areas or grips into the design can facilitate user interaction without applying excessive force to the closing mechanism." />

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the desired color scheme for the project includes:&#10;&#10;1. Yellow: Both Marketing and the Industrial Designer have suggested using yellow as one of the primary colors for the product. It is proposed for use in the main color of the product, as well as for LEDs to increase visibility.&#10;&#10;2. Bright primary colors like red and yellow: The Industrial Designer has proposed these colors for a more futuristic design. This suggests that bright, attention-grabbing colors are favored by the team.&#10;&#10;3. Dark blue: Although not explicitly mentioned as a preferred color for the product itself, Marketing did discuss dark blue as an option for a backlight or overall color with high contrast suggested for readability. This implies that dark blue could still be considered for certain design elements where high contrast is important.&#10;&#10;4. Flashy colors (orange and red): While not directly related to the desired color scheme, Marketing did mention orange and red as potential colors for objects on the remote. These flashy colors might be useful when highlighting specific features or functions of the product.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that the team is not favoring black and green for button colors or general aesthetic due to concerns about it looking cheap or old-fashioned. Overall, the desired color scheme leans towards bright, futuristic colors with high contrast where necessary." />
    <node id="1. Pop-up screen for simple functions and side view: The Industrial Designer and Marketing team have expressed support for the idea of a pop-up screen that primarily displays simple functions, which can be flipped to reveal more advanced options. However, there are concerns about the potential cost of implementing this feature, as mentioned by the Project Manager and Marketing. A decision on this would likely involve weighing the benefits of improved user experience against the added expense." />

    <node id="1. Enhanced Visibility: The use of transparent plastic for the light-only buttons allows for even and vibrant illumination, making them more visible and easier to understand, especially in low-light conditions. This enhanced visibility improves user interaction by ensuring that users can easily locate and identify the buttons they need to press.&#10;&#10;2. Futuristic Aesthetics: The light-only feature creates a more modern and futuristic design, which caters to specific user groups' preferences. This aesthetic appeal can engage users who value innovative technology and contribute to a positive user experience.&#10;&#10;3. Customizability: Using plastic buttons enables various color options, including yellow as suggested by the team, allowing for customization that aligns with branding or user preferences. Different colors can be used to distinguish between functions or provide visual cues for specific actions, further improving user interaction.&#10;&#10;4. Durability and Longevity: The durability of plastic buttons ensures consistent performance over time, maintaining the quality of user interaction throughout the product's lifespan. This reliability is essential for building trust with users and ensuring their satisfaction with the device.&#10;&#10;5. Cost-effectiveness and Accessibility: Plastic materials are relatively inexpensive, which can help keep production costs down without compromising on quality. This cost savings can be beneficial for users, as it may contribute to a more affordable price point or allow for additional features to be included in the product's design.&#10;&#10;6. Manufacturing Feasibility: Plastic materials enable intricate designs and shapes that might not be possible using other materials.

However, the Industrial Designer brought up the idea of using kinetic energy, where the user has to move the device to generate power. This concept was discussed among the team members, with some expressing agreement on exploring it as an optional feature or even combining it with a battery as a hybrid solution. The Industrial Designer also mentioned that a kinetic energy source might be more expensive than other options.&#10;&#10;As for the case material, the doubly curved rubber case was chosen, and the Industrial Designer suggested using rubber materials for better durability and increased visibility of the product. This choice seems to be influenced by aesthetic preferences as well as functionality considerations. The team did not explicitly discuss why they chose a doubly curved case specifically, but it can be inferred that this design decision might contribute to a more ergonomic and visually appealing product.">

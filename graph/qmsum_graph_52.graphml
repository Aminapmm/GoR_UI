    <node id="1. The volunteer, Gelbart, has experience working on the Transcriber project, which is relevant to the current project.&#10;2. Gelbart is more familiar with Tcl-TK than Grad H, which is beneficial because the GUI of the project may use Tcl-TK, as suggested by Grad H.&#10;3. The Transcriber uses Snack for audio functionality, and it is possible that the GUI also utilizes Snack. Since Gelbart has experience with both Transcriber and Tcl-TK, he can help integrate Snack functionality into the project's GUI more efficiently." />
    <node id=" Gelbart {disfmarker} Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: and he 's more familiar with Tcl - TK than I am .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: And then you get {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} then you get the Windows media playing for free .&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Well that 's Snack , not {disfmarker} not Transcriber .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can {disfmarker} but you can use a {disfmarker} a lot of the same functionality and it 's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Yeah , yeah , I mean , I {disfmarker} I think THISL {disfmarker} THISL GUI probably uses Snack .

    <node id="Content: yeah .

    <node id="1. Speaker PhD G suggests keeping a PDA for a year and sees its potential for use in meetings, such as synchronizing events and serving as a convenience for noting down points. Speaker Grad H also finds it useful as a mechanism to show off a synchronization feature of the project. However, there is no explicit discussion about the impact on workload.&#10;2. PhD E proposes getting a PDA with a wireless card to easily synchronize with the Linux server during meetings. This suggests that using a PDA might increase the workload for those responsible for setting up and maintaining the necessary infrastructure.&#10;3. The possibility of using buttons as input on the PDA is mentioned, but there is no further discussion about the user interface or interaction design, which could impact the workload of the development team.&#10;4. Professor B emphasizes that their goal is to let researchers know what they are doing by presenting their work, which might include the use of PDAs in meetings. This suggests that there is a commitment to explore this technology's potential and its implications on workload.&#10;5. The discussion about XML tools indicates that the group is moving towards using XML as a general format for data, including meeting data. This shift could impact the workload, as it might require additional effort to adapt existing tools and formats to the new XML-based system. However, Grad H mentions that XML tools offer extraction and reformatting capabilities, which could help manage the workload.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is enthusiasm for using PDAs in meetings and recognizing its potential benefits, there is no explicit discussion about the impact on workload. The introduction of XML tools might affect the workload but could also provide advantages in terms of data handling and flexibility." />

    <node id=" meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just {disfmarker} just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card .

    <node id=" on meeting data so it might be neat , you know .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah . Good . Done with that . XML tools ?&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Um .

Um . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .

    <node id="1. The group tried having a designated scribe to take meeting notes, but they &quot;did it once or twice and it sort of died out&quot; (PhD G).&#10;2. They mention facing difficulties with synchronizing the time on the CrossPads and the recording, which was one of the issues discussed originally (Grad H, PhD G).&#10;3. The group also considered having someone listen to the tape and take notes in some other interface after the meeting, but decided against it because they would not have the time reference or other useful cues that come with live note-taking (PhD F, PhD G).&#10;4. Postdoc A mentioned imagining a system where participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This idea is not further discussed in the transcripts.&#10;5. Although they do not explicitly mention the reason for discontinuing the designated scribe, it can be inferred that they faced difficulties with infrastructure and synchronization, leading them to explore alternative solutions." />
    <node id=" that was one of the things ,&#10;Speaker: PhD D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: right ? And so the {disfmarker} it seemed like a neat idea . We 'll have a {disfmarker} you know , have a scribe , have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Yep , and then just sort of died out .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It 's uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: I mean {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Yeah that 's right .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Well I did it one time&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: but um {disfmark" />

    <node id="marker} and put some kind of summary or something uh you know , some {disfmarker} there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But {disfmarker} then you don't {disfmarker} you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live .&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: Right . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful ,&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: PhD F&#10;Content: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ?&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: so .&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time {disfmarker} the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: &#10;Speaker: Post" />
    <node id=" but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . So . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: which you then get back in a transcript&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Well .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: I guess {disfmarker} so , you know , what {disfmarker} what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: so .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and put some kind of summary or something uh you know , some {disfmarker} there 'd be some scribe who would actually" />

I mean ,&#10;Speaker: PhD G&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: uh part of the reason {disfmarker} I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad H&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and so forth so and {disfmarker}" />

    <node id="1. Postdoc A proposes an alternative solution to the problem of synchronization infrastructure by suggesting that participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This would allow them to bypass the need for a synchronized clock on the recording device, as they could use voice cues or other methods to indicate important moments.&#10;2. However, Grad H raises the issue of someone having to listen to the tape and find that point, which suggests that there would still be some level of infrastructure required to support this alternative method. Postdoc A confirms that the marked points would be transcribed and included in the transcript, indicating that this alternative solution may not eliminate the need for transcription entirely.&#10;3. Nonetheless, this proposal represents a departure from the traditional model of a designated scribe taking notes during the meeting, and highlights the group's ongoing efforts to explore alternative solutions to the challenges of meeting note-taking and synchronization." />

    <node id="The speakers in the transcripts discuss different opinions on backing up data due to the importance of ensuring that their data cannot be lost or recovered. Some members of the group believe in having multiple backup modalities for safety, as they recognize that data loss can occur even with backups (Grad H). In contrast, others argue against this approach, claiming it is unnecessary and that a manual backup using NW archive is sufficient (Grad H). This disagreement stems from the varying perspectives on risk tolerance and the importance of having multiple layers of protection for their data. Professor B appears to be more concerned about the burden of incremental backups on resources but ultimately agrees with the need for additional disk space to accommodate the group's expanding files (Professor B)." />

    <node id="1. The group discussed the challenges they faced with their previous attempt at having a designated scribe take meeting notes, including difficulties with synchronizing the time on the CrossPads and the recording. They also considered having someone listen to the tape and take notes in some other interface after the meeting but decided against it due to the lack of time reference and other useful cues that come with live note-taking.&#10;2. Postdoc A proposed an alternative solution where participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This idea was not further discussed in the transcripts but represents a departure from the traditional model of a designated scribe taking notes and highlights the group's efforts to explore alternative solutions to the challenges of meeting note-taking and synchronization.&#10;3. During the discussion, Professor B emphasized their goal of presenting their work to researchers using PDAs in meetings, indicating a commitment to exploring this technology's potential and its implications on workload. The group acknowledged that using PDAs might increase the workload for those responsible for setting up and maintaining the necessary infrastructure but saw potential benefits in terms of data handling and flexibility with XML tools.&#10;4. Regarding the transcript and simultaneous recording or presentation, Grad H mentioned the possibility of having a more user-friendly interface for playing back audio, as he finds the current command line approach less appealing. The group discussed two existing tools for playing back audio: a web-based tool developed by the SoftSound team and a command line tool, with the former requiring modification to work on UNIX systems for meetings. While ensuring data is saved before the next group arrives, the group recognized the need to balance the benefits of using PDAs and XML tools with the potential impact on workload." />

    <node id="1. The Cygnus tools provide a BSD compatibility layer that allows normal UNIX function calls to work. This is useful because it helps ensure consistency when working with different Unix-like systems.&#10;2. The lack of using Autoconf in the THISL tools resulted in porting problems because, without it, there were differences in header files, definitions, and compiler workarounds between various systems. This made it more challenging to get the tools to compile correctly on different platforms, such as Solaris and Windows. Autoconf is a tool that helps automate the process of configuring software for different platforms, making it easier to ensure compatibility across different systems." />

    <node id="1. Analog-to-digital conversion issue: The CrossPad records handwritten notes in an analog format, which then needs to be converted into a digital record for further processing or analysis. This process can introduce problems such as synchronization errors due to the use of a hand-held unit with a battery.&#10;&#10;2. Infrastructure and setup challenges: There is extra work involved in setting up the infrastructure for using CrossPads, including synchronizing time at the beginning of each meeting and downloading data from individual pads to an application. The process also involves converting data into different formats that can be used for further analysis or review.&#10;&#10;3. Limited integration with other tools: CrossPad does not seem to integrate well with existing note-taking interfaces, as mentioned by PhD D, who was unaware of what a CrossPad was despite participating in the discussions about it. This lack of familiarity and compatibility may make it more difficult for users to adopt the technology and fully utilize its features.&#10;&#10;4. Time markings: While time markings are one of the advantages of using CrossPads, as mentioned by Postdoc A, they might not be sufficient to replace detailed notes taken during meetings. This could lead to issues when reviewing or analyzing meeting content if additional context is needed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the main challenges and limitations of using CrossPads include difficulties with analog-to-digital conversion, extra work involved in setup and data processing, limited integration with other tools, and potential shortcomings in replacing traditional note-taking methods." />

    <node id="1. In the transcript, Grad H pointed out an issue with some participants being filled in under the &quot;description&quot; section instead of the designated &quot;participants&quot; area. This could potentially cause confusion and make it more difficult to keep track of who was present during the meeting. However, no further details about this problem were discussed in the transcript provided.&#10;   &#10;2. Regarding the development of a new version of the tool for indicating microphone connection status, Grad H mentioned that he is working on incorporating visual cues into the user interface to help users determine if their microphones are functioning properly. This includes considerations for differentiating between high-quality microphones like Crown models, which may have similar output levels whether they are turned on or off. Some potential solutions include displaying an on-screen level meter, adding LED indicators, and even including a buzzer to signal the status of the microphone. These features would provide users with a more noticeable and accessible way of monitoring their microphone's status and battery level during meetings." />

This discussion arose from the group's difficulties with synchronization infrastructure when using a designated scribe to take meeting notes, which &quot;sort of died out&quot; according to PhD G.&#10;2. As for generating a summary of what happened in a meeting, there is no explicit recommendation mentioned in the transcript. However, Professor B raised the question of where such a summary would come from if they were to go by a &quot;gold standard&quot; of what was discussed during the meeting. This implies that the group may still be considering different options for generating summaries or highlights of their discussions, including possible automated solutions like OCR and searching.&#10;&#10;In summary, the purpose of discussing the device with OCR and searching capabilities is to explore alternative note-taking and summarization methods due to the difficulties faced by the group in using a designated scribe. As for generating a summary of what happened in a meeting, there is no explicit recommendation mentioned, but it remains an open question for the group as they continue to discuss different options." />

Regarding the wireless systems and room rewiring, Grad H plans to order more wireless equipment and rewire the room so that the first N channels are for close-talking (probably wired) microphones, and the next N channels are for far-field (probably wireless) microphones.&#10;2. Professor B makes a humorous commentary on the phrase &quot;order more wireless&quot; by pointing out its irony since ordering more of something typically involves getting more of the physical entity, whereas in this case, they are ordering the absence of wires." />

    <node id="1. The speakers are discussing the use of XML tools to extract information from various files, including user databases and meeting key files that are being converted to XML format. This processing involves converting the data into XML and then using various tools to extract and reformat the information.&#10;2. Grad H is also suggesting the idea of implementing an &quot;indirect timeline business,&quot; which would allow for more flexible extraction and manipulation of temporal data in the meeting transcripts. Although not explicitly defined in the conversation, it seems to refer to a method for marking the start and end times of each utterance or event within the XML-formatted transcripts, making it easier to search, sort, and analyze the data.&#10;&#10;In summary, Grad H is referring to using XML tools for processing files and extracting information from them, with an emphasis on implementing a more flexible timeline system for analyzing meeting data." />

    <node id="1. The status of the transcription project is that several more transcribers have been hired by the postdoc and they are making good progress. However, Postdoc A has not yet finished double-checking their work, which was expected to be done by that day but will now take another week.&#10;2. Grad H has been able to make progress on using the THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data, and the command line version of the indexing and querying is working. However, there may be some challenges in getting the tools to compile and work on Windows.&#10;3. Dave Johnson advised against putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on a non-backed-up disk, and instead recommended having multiple backups in different forms to ensure the data cannot be lost.&#10;4. In response to Grad H's question, Postdoc A confirms that the transcription files are located in the &quot;transcripts&quot; sub-directory.&#10;5. PhD D has processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up, meaning they can be sent to IBM for use in information retrieval. The second one of these meetings has already been sent to IBM." />
    <node id="1. Based on the conversation, it is unclear if anyone has yet attempted to compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD. The participants mention that Free BSD might be easier for porting due to its UNIX-like nature, but there is no confirmation that it has been tried or how long it would take.&#10;2. Given the information that it took a day to get the THISL tools to compile under Solaris and considering Windows as a more challenging platform, one can't provide a precise difficulty level for Free BSD without trying. However, considering the differences between systems, it might take more than just a day or two to successfully compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD.&#10;3. For a more accurate assessment of compatibility with Free BSD, further investigation is required. Asking someone familiar with the target platform (Free BSD) or attempting to compile and test the software on that specific system would provide better insight into the porting effort needed." />
    <node id="1. Moving to XML as the general format for transcription and meeting data has several advantages. Firstly, XML is a widely-used standard format that allows for easy data exchange between different applications and platforms. This can simplify the process of working with various tools and systems for extracting, processing, and analyzing meeting data. Secondly, XML provides a flexible structure that can be easily customized to suit specific needs, making it an ideal choice for storing and organizing complex hierarchical data like transcriptions.&#10;2. Meeting to discuss improving the current transcription formats in XML could be beneficial for optimizing the data extraction and analysis process. By refining the XML format, you can ensure that it captures all necessary information while remaining compatible with a wide range of tools. Additionally, standardizing the XML structure across different projects or organizations can promote interoperability and enable better collaboration between teams working on similar problems.&#10;&#10;In summary, moving to XML for transcription and meeting data is a promising idea due to its flexibility and compatibility with various tools. Meeting to discuss improving the current XML format can help optimize the extraction and analysis process, promoting interoperability and facilitating collaboration in the field." />
    <node id="1. XML Conversion Tools: To convert existing user databases and key files into XML format, the team will need appropriate conversion tools that can parse through their current data structures and transform them into well-formed XML documents.

After processing the query, the tool returns a list of &quot;hits&quot; or instances where the queried keywords appear in the audio file(s).&#10;3. Each hit is associated with some audio segment containing the keyword occurrence.&#10;4. Users can click on these hits to listen to the corresponding audio segments, enabling them to browse and navigate through relevant parts of the audio easily." />

    <node id="1. To ensure clarity and accurate tracking of participants during meetings, the group needs to fill out the required information in the designated &quot;participants&quot; area instead of the &quot;description&quot; section. This action will help prevent confusion and make it easier to keep track of who is present.&#10;2. When using microphones during meetings, the group should pay attention to the visual cues in the user interface that Grad H is developing. These cues will help users determine if their microphones are functioning properly, including considerations for high-quality microphones like Crown models, which may have similar output levels whether they are turned on or off. The proposed features, such as an on-screen level meter, LED indicators, and a buzzer, will provide users with a more noticeable and accessible way of monitoring their microphone's status and battery level.&#10;&#10;By following these steps, the group can promote clear communication, accurate tracking of participants, and efficient use of microphones during meetings." />
    <node id="One potential solution proposed to address the challenge of synchronizing various annotation tools is Postdoc A's idea of having participants mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This approach could help alleviate the need for a synchronized clock on the recording device, as voice cues or other methods can be used to indicate important moments.&#10;&#10;This proposed solution is related to the idea of getting someone to buy into the task of using these tools during meetings because it represents a departure from the traditional model of a designated scribe taking notes. By involving all participants in the process of marking key points, this alternative method fosters a sense of shared responsibility and engagement with the annotation tools. This increased involvement may lead to better buy-in from participants, as they become more invested in the success and effectiveness of the annotation process.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this approach can help mitigate some of the issues faced by having a single designated scribe, such as difficulties with synchronizing time on different devices or maintaining live note-taking cues. By allowing multiple participants to contribute to the annotation process, there is a higher likelihood that important points are captured accurately and in a timely manner, ultimately improving the overall quality of the meeting data." />
    <node id="The speakers in the transcripts discuss the importance of having multiple backups for certain data to ensure that they cannot lose or recover their data. While some members of the group believe in having multiple backup modalities for safety, others argue against this approach, claiming it is unnecessary and that a manual backup using NW archive is sufficient. This disagreement stems from varying perspectives on risk tolerance and the importance of having multiple layers of protection for their data.&#10;&#10;Professor B initially expresses concern about the burden of incremental backups on resources but ultimately agrees with the need for additional disk space to accommodate the group's expanding files. Grad H suggests implementing an indirect timeline business, which would allow for more flexible extraction and manipulation of temporal data in the meeting transcripts. This approach emphasizes using XML tools for processing files and extracting information from them, with a focus on creating a more flexible timeline system for analyzing meeting data.&#10;&#10;Despite the possibility of overhead costs associated with multiple backups, the speakers recognize the importance of ensuring that their data is secure and cannot be lost or recovered. They acknowledge that losing critical data can have severe consequences, making the investment in multiple backup systems worthwhile. The group appears to agree on the need for additional disk space and implementing a system that prioritizes backing up important data using various modalities, even if it involves some overhead costs." />
    <node id="1. Synchronizing the time between the CrossPad and the recording is a challenge that the group discussed in their meeting transcripts. They mentioned that it's difficult to keep the time synchronized on hand-held devices like the CrossPad due to battery power.&#10;2. To create an infrastructure for using the CrossPads, several steps are required:&#10;   - Synchronizing all pads at the beginning of each meeting so they match the time on a central recording device.&#10;   - Downloading the data from individual pads to an application for further processing or analysis.&#10;   - Converting the data into different formats that can be used for review or analysis.&#10;3. The group considered alternative solutions, such as having someone listen to the tape and take notes in another interface after the meeting. However, they decided against this option because it would not have the time reference or other useful cues that come with live note-taking.&#10;4. Postdoc A proposed an alternative solution where participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This idea was not further discussed but highlights the group's efforts to explore alternative solutions to the challenges of meeting note-taking and synchronization." />
    <node id="1. The speakers discuss different opinions on backing up data due to varying perspectives on risk tolerance and the importance of having multiple layers of protection for their data. Some members believe in having multiple backup modalities, while others argue that a manual backup using NW archive is sufficient.&#10;2. Despite concerns about overhead costs, the group recognizes the importance of ensuring their data cannot be lost or recovered, given the severe consequences of losing critical data.&#10;3. The recommended method for preserving data seems to be implementing a system that prioritizes backing up important data using various modalities, including disk backup and NW archive, even if it involves some overhead costs. This approach ensures that, in case of a mistake or loss of one backup, there is another backup available to recover the data from.&#10;4. Additionally, Grad H suggests implementing an &quot;indirect timeline business&quot; for more flexible extraction and manipulation of temporal data in meeting transcripts. This method involves using XML tools to process files and extract information, focusing on creating a more flexible timeline system for analyzing meeting data." />
    <node id="1. The suggested alternative for the Channeltrans interface is to use the Tcl-TK GUI front-end created by Dan for Broadcast News, as mentioned by Grad H. This was recommended due to the complexity of implementing a web server and potentially porting it to Windows.&#10;2. Using this approach would make it easier to integrate Snack functionality into the project's GUI since Gelbart has experience with both Transcriber and Tcl-TK, as he had worked on the Transcriber project which utilizes Snack for audio functionalities.&#10;3. The Tcl-TK GUI front-end created by Dan for Broadcast News offers a more user-friendly interface compared to the current command line approach, allowing users to input queries in the form of keywords and return a list of &quot;hits&quot; or instances where the queried keywords appear in the audio file(s). Users can then click on these hits to listen to the corresponding audio segments." />
    <node id="1. The differences in &quot;include&quot; files and function calls mentioned by Grad H are likely related to the use of different programming libraries or versions in various parts of the project codebase. This can cause inconsistencies and require additional effort to integrate and maintain.&#10;2. The Transcriber interface demo, as mentioned by Professor B, seems to be a significant part of the project. This demo focuses on showing off the Transcriber interface itself, as well as demonstrating the speech-nonspeech features developed by Thilo. These features are likely related to audio processing and analysis in the Transcriber project.&#10;3. The discussion between Gelbart, PhD E, and Grad H reveals that the Transcriber project uses Snack for audio functionality, which might also be used in the GUI of the current project. Since Gelbart has experience with both Transcriber and Tcl-TK, he can help integrate Snack functionality into the project's GUI more efficiently.&#10;&#10;Overall, the conversation revolves around integrating various components of different projects, addressing portability issues, and ensuring smooth interaction between audio processing features and GUI elements." />

    <node id="1. The find and play feature in the Channeltrans interface involves searching for a specific string or term and then playing the corresponding audio segment where the searched string appears.&#10;&#10;2. The text-retrieval scoring system used is based on term frequency, inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). This means that the system calculates scores for terms based on their frequency in the document (audio file) and inversely proportional to their overall frequency across all documents in the corpus. This approach helps prioritize rare yet significant terms while reducing the importance of common words.&#10;&#10;3. The system also includes various metrics for spacing, determining how far apart matches have to be within the audio files. These sophisticated features make the search more nuanced and user-friendly compared to basic Windows-based interfaces." />

Given the information that it took a day to get the THISL tools to compile under Solaris and considering Windows as a more challenging platform, one can't provide a precise difficulty level for Free BSD without trying. However, considering the differences between systems, it might take more than just a day or two to successfully compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD.&#10;3. For a more accurate assessment of compatibility with Free BSD, further investigation is required. Asking someone familiar with the target platform (Free BSD) or attempting to compile and test the software on that specific system would provide better insight into the porting effort needed.">

The suggested alternative for the Channeltrans interface is to use the Tcl-TK GUI front-end created by Dan for Broadcast News, as mentioned by Grad H. This was recommended due to the complexity of implementing a web server and potentially porting it to Windows.&#10;2. Using this approach would make it easier to integrate Snack functionality into the project's GUI since Gelbart has experience with both Transcriber and Tcl-TK, as he had worked on the Transcriber project which utilizes Snack for audio functionalities.&#10;3. The Tcl-TK GUI front-end created by Dan for Broadcast News offers a more user-friendly interface compared to the current command line approach, allowing users to input queries in the form of keywords and return a list of &quot;hits&quot; or instances where the queried keywords appear in the audio file(s).

The differences in &quot;include&quot; files and function calls mentioned by Grad H are likely related to the use of different programming libraries or versions in various parts of the project codebase. This can cause inconsistencies and require additional effort to integrate and maintain.&#10;2. The Transcriber interface demo, as mentioned by Professor B, seems to be a significant part of the project. This demo focuses on showing off the Transcriber interface itself, as well as demonstrating the speech-nonspeech features developed by Thilo. These features are likely related to audio processing and analysis in the Transcriber project.&#10;3. The discussion between Gelbart, PhD E, and Grad H reveals that the Transcriber project uses Snack for audio functionality, which might also be used in the GUI of the current project. Since Gelbart has experience with both Transcriber and Tcl-TK, he can help integrate Snack functionality into the project's GUI more efficiently.&#10;&#10;Overall, the conversation revolves around integrating various components of different projects, addressing portability issues, and ensuring smooth interaction between audio processing features and GUI elements.">

Postdoc A proposes an alternative solution to the problem of synchronization infrastructure by suggesting that participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This would allow them to bypass the need for a synchronized clock on the recording device, as they could use voice cues or other methods to indicate important moments.&#10;2.

Firstly, XML is a widely-used standard format that allows for easy data exchange between different applications and platforms. This can simplify the process of working with various tools and systems for extracting, processing, and analyzing meeting data. Secondly, XML provides a flexible structure that can be easily customized to suit specific needs, making it an ideal choice for storing and organizing complex hierarchical data like transcriptions.&#10;2. Meeting to discuss improving the current transcription formats in XML could be beneficial for optimizing the data extraction and analysis process. By refining the XML format, you can ensure that it captures all necessary information while remaining compatible with a wide range of tools. Additionally, standardizing the XML structure across different projects or organizations can promote interoperability and enable better collaboration between teams working on similar problems.&#10;&#10;In summary, moving to XML for transcription and meeting data is a promising idea due to its flexibility and compatibility with various tools. Meeting to discuss improving the current XML format can help optimize the extraction and analysis process, promoting interoperability and facilitating collaboration in the field.">

Infrastructure and setup challenges: There is extra work involved in setting up the infrastructure for using CrossPads, including synchronizing time at the beginning of each meeting and downloading data from individual pads to an application. The process also involves converting data into different formats that can be used for further analysis or review.&#10;&#10;3. Limited integration with other tools: CrossPad does not seem to integrate well with existing note-taking interfaces, as mentioned by PhD D, who was unaware of what a CrossPad was despite participating in the discussions about it.

To ensure clarity and accurate tracking of participants during meetings, the group needs to fill out the required information in the designated &quot;participants&quot; area instead of the &quot;description&quot; section. This action will help prevent confusion and make it easier to keep track of who is present.&#10;2. When using microphones during meetings, the group should pay attention to the visual cues in the user interface that Grad H is developing. These cues will help users determine if their microphones are functioning properly, including considerations for high-quality microphones like Crown models, which may have similar output levels whether they are turned on or off. The proposed features, such as an on-screen level meter, LED indicators, and a buzzer, will provide users with a more noticeable and accessible way of monitoring their microphone's status and battery level.&#10;&#10;By following these steps, the group can promote clear communication, accurate tracking of participants, and efficient use of microphones during meetings.">

This increased involvement may lead to better buy-in from participants, as they become more invested in the success and effectiveness of the annotation process.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this approach can help mitigate some of the issues faced by having a single designated scribe, such as difficulties with synchronizing time on different devices or maintaining live note-taking cues.

The group discussed the challenges they faced with their previous attempt at having a designated scribe take meeting notes, including difficulties with synchronizing the time on the CrossPads and the recording. They also considered having someone listen to the tape and take notes in some other interface after the meeting but decided against it due to the lack of time reference and other useful cues that come with live note-taking.&#10;2. Postdoc A proposed an alternative solution where participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This idea was not further discussed in the transcripts but represents a departure from the traditional model of a designated scribe taking notes and highlights the group's efforts to explore alternative solutions to the challenges of meeting note-taking and synchronization.&#10;3. During the discussion, Professor B emphasized their goal of presenting their work to researchers using PDAs in meetings, indicating a commitment to exploring this technology's potential and its implications on workload. The group acknowledged that using PDAs might increase the workload for those responsible for setting up and maintaining the necessary infrastructure but saw potential benefits in terms of data handling and flexibility with XML tools.&#10;4.

Based on the conversation, it is unclear if anyone has yet attempted to compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD. The participants mention that Free BSD might be easier for porting due to its UNIX-like nature, but there is no confirmation that it has been tried or how long it would take.&#10;2. Given the information that it took a day to get the THISL tools to compile under Solaris and considering Windows as a more challenging platform, one can't provide a precise difficulty level for Free BSD without trying. However, considering the differences between systems, it might take more than just a day or two to successfully compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD.&#10;3. For a more accurate assessment of compatibility with Free BSD, further investigation is required. Asking someone familiar with the target platform (Free BSD) or attempting to compile and test the software on that specific system would provide better insight into the porting effort needed.">

The differences in &quot;include&quot; files and function calls mentioned by Grad H are likely related to the use of different programming libraries or versions in various parts of the project codebase. This can cause inconsistencies and require additional effort to integrate and maintain.&#10;2. The Transcriber interface demo, as mentioned by Professor B, seems to be a significant part of the project. This demo focuses on showing off the Transcriber interface itself, as well as demonstrating the speech-nonspeech features developed by Thilo. These features are likely related to audio processing and analysis in the Transcriber project.&#10;3. The discussion between Gelbart, PhD E, and Grad H reveals that the Transcriber project uses Snack for audio functionality, which might also be used in the GUI of the current project. Since Gelbart has experience with both Transcriber and Tcl-TK, he can help integrate Snack functionality into the project's GUI more efficiently.&#10;&#10;Overall, the conversation revolves around integrating various components of different projects, addressing portability issues, and ensuring smooth interaction between audio processing features and GUI elements.">

Autoconf is a tool that helps automate the process of configuring software for different platforms, making it easier to ensure compatibility across different systems.">

Based on the conversation, it is unclear if anyone has yet attempted to compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD. The participants mention that Free BSD might be easier for porting due to its UNIX-like nature, but there is no confirmation that it has been tried or how long it would take.&#10;2. Given the information that it took a day to get the THISL tools to compile under Solaris and considering Windows as a more challenging platform, one can't provide a precise difficulty level for Free BSD without trying. However, considering the differences between systems, it might take more than just a day or two to successfully compile and run the THISL tools on Free BSD.&#10;3. For a more accurate assessment of compatibility with Free BSD, further investigation is required. Asking someone familiar with the target platform (Free BSD) or attempting to compile and test the software on that specific system would provide better insight into the porting effort needed.">

In the transcript, Grad H pointed out an issue with some participants being filled in under the &quot;description&quot; section instead of the designated &quot;participants&quot; area. This could potentially cause confusion and make it more difficult to keep track of who was present during the meeting. However, no further details about this problem were discussed in the transcript provided.&#10;   &#10;2. Regarding the development of a new version of the tool for indicating microphone connection status, Grad H mentioned that he is working on incorporating visual cues into the user interface to help users determine if their microphones are functioning properly. This includes considerations for differentiating between high-quality microphones like Crown models, which may have similar output levels whether they are turned on or off. Some potential solutions include displaying an on-screen level meter, adding LED indicators, and even including a buzzer to signal the status of the microphone. These features would provide users with a more noticeable and accessible way of monitoring their microphone's status and battery level during meetings.">

The group discussed the challenges they faced with their previous attempt at having a designated scribe take meeting notes, including difficulties with synchronizing the time on the CrossPads and the recording. They also considered having someone listen to the tape and take notes in some other interface after the meeting but decided against it due to the lack of time reference and other useful cues that come with live note-taking.&#10;2. Postdoc A proposed an alternative solution where participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This idea was not further discussed in the transcripts but represents a departure from the traditional model of a designated scribe taking notes and highlights the group's efforts to explore alternative solutions to the challenges of meeting note-taking and synchronization.&#10;3. During the discussion, Professor B emphasized their goal of presenting their work to researchers using PDAs in meetings, indicating a commitment to exploring this technology's potential and its implications on workload. The group acknowledged that using PDAs might increase the workload for those responsible for setting up and maintaining the necessary infrastructure but saw potential benefits in terms of data handling and flexibility with XML tools.&#10;4. Regarding the transcript and simultaneous recording or presentation, Grad H mentioned the possibility of having a more user-friendly interface for playing back audio, as he finds the current command line approach less appealing. The group discussed two existing tools for playing back audio: a web-based tool developed by the SoftSound team and a command line tool, with the former requiring modification to work on UNIX systems for meetings. While ensuring data is saved before the next group arrives, the group recognized the need to balance the benefits of using PDAs and XML tools with the potential impact on workload.">

Moving to XML as the general format for transcription and meeting data has several advantages. Firstly, XML is a widely-used standard format that allows for easy data exchange between different applications and platforms. This can simplify the process of working with various tools and systems for extracting, processing, and analyzing meeting data. Secondly, XML provides a flexible structure that can be easily customized to suit specific needs, making it an ideal choice for storing and organizing complex hierarchical data like transcriptions.&#10;2. Meeting to discuss improving the current transcription formats in XML could be beneficial for optimizing the data extraction and analysis process. By refining the XML format, you can ensure that it captures all necessary information while remaining compatible with a wide range of tools. Additionally, standardizing the XML structure across different projects or organizations can promote interoperability and enable better collaboration between teams working on similar problems.&#10;&#10;In summary, moving to XML for transcription and meeting data is a promising idea due to its flexibility and compatibility with various tools.

To create an infrastructure for using the CrossPads, several steps are required:&#10;   - Synchronizing all pads at the beginning of each meeting so they match the time on a central recording device.&#10;   - Downloading the data from individual pads to an application for further processing or analysis.&#10;   - Converting the data into different formats that can be used for review or analysis.&#10;3. The group considered alternative solutions, such as having someone listen to the tape and take notes in another interface after the meeting. However, they decided against this option because it would not have the time reference or other useful cues that come with live note-taking.&#10;4. Postdoc A proposed an alternative solution where participants could mark certain points during the meeting for later review, instead of having one person take notes throughout the entire session. This idea was not further discussed but highlights the group's efforts to explore alternative solutions to the challenges of meeting note-taking and synchronization.">

However, there may be some challenges in getting the tools to compile and work on Windows.&#10;3. Dave Johnson advised against putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on a non-backed-up disk, and instead recommended having multiple backups in different forms to ensure the data cannot be lost.&#10;4. In response to Grad H's question, Postdoc A confirms that the transcription files are located in the &quot;transcripts&quot; sub-directory.&#10;5.

This approach could help alleviate the need for a synchronized clock on the recording device, as voice cues or other methods can be used to indicate important moments.&#10;&#10;This proposed solution is related to the idea of getting someone to buy into the task of using these tools during meetings because it represents a departure from the traditional model of a designated scribe taking notes. By involving all participants in the process of marking key points, this alternative method fosters a sense of shared responsibility and engagement with the annotation tools. This increased involvement may lead to better buy-in from participants, as they become more invested in the success and effectiveness of the annotation process.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this approach can help mitigate some of the issues faced by having a single designated scribe, such as difficulties with synchronizing time on different devices or maintaining live note-taking cues. By allowing multiple participants to contribute to the annotation process, there is a higher likelihood that important points are captured accurately and in a timely manner, ultimately improving the overall quality of the meeting data.">

    <node id="In the given narrative, Oak feels disappointed about Miss Everdene not making him her bailiff because he had expected and hoped for the position. He had assumed that his skills and experience would make him a fitting candidate for the role. When Miss Everdene chose to be her own baily and keep Oak as a common shepherd, he felt let down. This was a source of frustration for him, as he believed he could have contributed more to the farm in a higher position." />

On approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed,&#10;the farmer drew out his pocket-book, unfastened it, and allowed it to&#10;lie open on his hand.  A letter was revealed--Bathsheba's.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was going to ask you, Oak,&quot; he said, with unreal carelessness, &quot;if&#10;you know whose writing this is?&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak glanced into the book, and replied instantly, with a flushed&#10;face, &quot;Miss Everdene's.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name.&#10;He now felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought.  The&#10;letter could of course be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry&#10;would not have been necessary.&#10;&#10;Boldwood mistook his confusion: sensitive persons are always ready&#10;with their &quot;Is it I?&quot; in preference to objective reasoning.&#10;&#10;&quot;The question was perfectly fair,&quot; he returned--and there was&#10;something incongruous in the serious earnestness with which he&#10;applied himself to an argument on a valent" />

I have&#10;already tried to please you too much for my own good!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba regarded him with round-eyed perplexity.

Good morning, Mr. Boldwood.&quot;&#10;The shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he&#10;had himself brought, and vanished with them in the direction of the&#10;lambing field hard by--their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful&#10;state, pleasantly contrasting with their death's-door plight of half&#10;an hour before.&#10;&#10;Boldwood followed him a little way up the field, hesitated, and&#10;turned back.

    <node id="1. The weather has changed from winter to early spring, which is evident from the fact that the sheep have been let out to graze on the meadows for the first time since harvest. This change in season brings new life to the vegetation, making it more vibrant and noticeable.&#10;2. Boldwood observes three figures in the distant meadows, one of whom is Miss Everdene. He sees them through the blazing sky, with one figure (Gabriel Oak) moving around vigorously like a black snuff against a candle-flame. This observation suggests that there is some activity or interaction happening among the three individuals, possibly related to their work on the farm.&#10;3. Boldwood's perception of the situation is influenced by his recent receipt of an anonymous Valentine, which he initially mistook as being for him or his shepherd but later discovered was actually addressed to Gabriel Oak, Miss Everdene's shepherd. This revelation and Oak's subsequent confusion when asked about the letter's origin make Boldwood suspicious of some sort of coquettish behavior between Oak and Miss Everdene.&#10;4. Bathsheba, who is aware of Boldwood's presence, tries to avoid him, fearing that he may have a severe or slighting demeanor towards her. As she moves away from him, she hears footsteps behind her, indicating that Boldwood has followed her. This behavior suggests that Boldwood may have an interest in Bathsheba, although she remains unaware of the depth of his feelings at this point." />

Gabriel, to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an&#10;April day, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and instantly&#10;discerned thereon the mark of some influence from without, in the&#10;form of a keenly self-conscious reddening.  He also turned and beheld&#10;Boldwood.&#10;&#10;At once connecting these signs with the letter Boldwood had shown&#10;him, Gabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that&#10;means, and carried on since, he knew not how.&#10;&#10;Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware&#10;of his presence, and the perception was as too much light turned upon&#10;his new sensibility.  He was still in the road, and by moving on he&#10;hoped that neither would recognize that he had originally intended&#10;to enter the field.  He passed by with an utter and overwhelming&#10;sensation of ignorance, shyness, and doubt.  Perhaps in her manner&#10;there were signs that she wished to see him--perhaps not--he could" />
    <node id="  His heart began to move within&#10;him.  Boldwood, it must be remembered, though forty years of age, had&#10;never before inspected a woman with the very centre and force of his&#10;glance; they had struck upon all his senses at wide angles.&#10;&#10;Was she really beautiful?  He could not assure himself that his&#10;opinion was true even now.  He furtively said to a neighbour, &quot;Is&#10;Miss Everdene considered handsome?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes; she was a good deal noticed the first time she came, if you&#10;remember.  A very handsome girl indeed.&quot;&#10;&#10;A man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions&#10;on the beauty of a woman he is half, or quite, in love with; a mere&#10;child's word on the point has the weight of an R.A.'s.  Boldwood was&#10;satisfied now.&#10;&#10;And this charming woman had in effect said to him, &quot;Marry me.&quot;  Why&#10;should she have done that strange thing?  Boldwood's blindness to&#10;the difference between approving of what circumstances suggest, and&#10;originating what they do not suggest, was well matched by Bathsheba's&#10;insens" />
    <node id=" hoping not to find her there; more, she fancied his&#10;brow severe and his eye slighting.  Bathsheba immediately contrived&#10;to withdraw, and glided along by the river till she was a stone's&#10;throw off.  She heard footsteps brushing the grass, and had a&#10;consciousness that love was encircling her like a perfume.  Instead&#10;of turning or waiting, Bathsheba went further among the high sedges,&#10;but Boldwood seemed determined, and pressed on till they were&#10;completely past the bend of the river. Here, without being seen,&#10;they could hear the splashing and shouts of the washers above.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Everdene!&quot; said the farmer.&#10;&#10;She trembled, turned, and said &quot;Good morning.&quot;  His tone was so&#10;utterly removed from all she had expected as a beginning.  It was&#10;lowness and quiet accentuated: an emphasis of deep meanings, their&#10;form, at the same time, being scarcely expressed.  Silence has&#10;sometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as the disembodied&#10;soul of feeling wandering without its carcase, and it is then more&#10;impressive than speech.  In the same way, to" />
    <node id="&#10;tragically.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon&#10;which she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic&#10;intensity.  Had she known Boldwood's moods, her blame would have&#10;been fearful, and the stain upon her heart ineradicable.  Moreover,&#10;had she known her present power for good or evil over this man, she&#10;would have trembled at her responsibility.  Luckily for her present,&#10;unluckily for her future tranquillity, her understanding had not yet&#10;told her what Boldwood was.  Nobody knew entirely; for though it was&#10;possible to form guesses concerning his wild capabilities from old&#10;floodmarks faintly visible, he had never been seen at the high tides&#10;which caused them.&#10;&#10;Farmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked forth across the&#10;level fields.  Beyond the first enclosure was a hedge, and on the&#10;other side of this a meadow belonging to Bathsheba's farm.&#10;&#10;It was now early spring--the time of going to grass with the sheep,&#10;when they have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid&#10;up for" />

From the narrative, it is implied that Bathsheba has been acting strangely, although specific details about her behavior are not provided in the text. However, it is mentioned that the people have been talking about her and that she wanted to ask Gabriel Oak if the men made any observations on her going behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood yesterday. This suggests that there might be some rumors or speculations about a relationship between Bathsheba and Mr. Boldwood." />

    <node id=" groove a series already started, is rarely apparent&#10;to the person confounded by the issue.&#10;&#10;When Boldwood went to bed he placed the valentine in the corner of&#10;the looking-glass.  He was conscious of its presence, even when his&#10;back was turned upon it.  It was the first time in Boldwood's life&#10;that such an event had occurred.  The same fascination that caused&#10;him to think it an act which had a deliberate motive prevented&#10;him from regarding it as an impertinence.  He looked again at&#10;the direction.  The mysterious influences of night invested the&#10;writing with the presence of the unknown writer.  Somebody's--some&#10;WOMAN'S--hand had travelled softly over the paper bearing his name;&#10;her unrevealed eyes had watched every curve as she formed it; her&#10;brain had seen him in imagination the while.  Why should she have&#10;imagined him?  Her mouth--were the lips red or pale, plump or&#10;creased?--had curved itself to a certain expression as the pen went&#10;on--the corners had moved with all their natural tremulousness: what&#10;had been the expression?&#10;&#10;The vision of the woman writing" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful&#10;tendency to benumb the mind.  It is a sort of attenuated variety of&#10;Ixion's punishment, and contributes a dismal chapter to the history&#10;of gaols.  The brain gets muddled, the head grows heavy, and the&#10;body's centre of gravity seems to settle by degrees in a leaden lump&#10;somewhere between the eyebrows and the crown.  Bathsheba felt the&#10;unpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen turns.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?&quot; she said.  &quot;My&#10;head is in a whirl, and I can't talk.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel turned.  Bathsheba then began, with some awkwardness,&#10;allowing her thoughts to stray occasionally from her story to attend&#10;to the shears, which required a little nicety in sharpening.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wanted to ask you if the men made any observations on my going&#10;behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood yesterday?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, they did,&quot; said Gabriel.  &quot;You don't hold the shears right,&#10;miss--I knew you wouldn't know the" />

She was a misty shape, and well she&#10;might be, considering that her original was at that moment sound&#10;asleep and oblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky.&#10;Whenever Boldwood dozed she took a form, and comparatively ceased to&#10;be a vision: when he awoke there was the letter justifying the dream.&#10;&#10;The moon shone to-night, and its light was not of a customary kind.&#10;His window admitted only a reflection of its rays, and the pale sheen&#10;had that reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward and&#10;lighting up his ceiling in an unnatural way, casting shadows in&#10;strange places, and putting lights where shadows had used to be.&#10;&#10;The substance of the epistle had occupied him but little in&#10;comparison with the fact of its arrival.  He suddenly wondered&#10;if anything more might be found in the envelope than what he had&#10;withdrawn.  He jumped out of bed in the weird light, took the&#10;letter, pulled" />

The&#10;smaller human elements were kept out of sight; the pettinesses that&#10;enter so largely into all earthly living and doing were disguised by&#10;the accident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting terms; and&#10;there was hardly awakened a thought in Boldwood that sorry household&#10;realities appertained to her, or that she, like all others, had&#10;moments of commonplace, when to be least plainly seen was to be most&#10;prettily remembered.  Thus a mild sort of apotheosis took place&#10;in his fancy, whilst she still lived and breathed within his own&#10;horizon, a troubled creature like himself.&#10;&#10;It was the end of May when the farmer determined to be no longer&#10;repulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense.  He had by this&#10;time grown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less&#10;even when it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the&#10;situation.

    <node id="The source of disagreement among Joseph Poorgrass, Billy Smallbury, Henery, and Mark Clark revolves around the capabilities and worth of a woman, as well as their own circumstances. Each character expresses their views in the following ways:&#10;&#10;1. Joseph Poorgrass: He agrees with Henery's assessment of the woman they are discussing but backs off when Gabriel Oak challenges them about speaking against her. Joseph expresses his view indirectly, mentioning that it is good that she isn't perfect, as it brings joy to others. He also shares his admiration for Oak's skills as a shepherd.&#10;&#10;2. Billy Smallbury: He believes the woman in question has some sense and thinks highly of her ability to speak real language. He implies that she might be a good match for Henery, suggesting that he should pursue her.&#10;&#10;3. Henery: He laments his missed opportunity to become a bailiff for the woman's household, believing he deserved the position. Henery expresses his disappointment and frustration about being &quot;cheated&quot; out of his rightful recompense. Later on, when talking about the mistress, he mentions that she will regret not having a bailiff. He also shares his general dissatisfaction with life's unfairness.&#10;&#10;4. Mark Clark: While initially agreeing with Henery and Joseph Poorgrass about speaking against the woman, Mark changes his tune when Gabriel Oak scolds him. Later, he expresses admiration for her looks and wishes he had a chance with her, making a smacking sound to emphasize his feelings.&#10;&#10;In summary, these characters disagree on the worth of the woman in question, as well as their own circumstances. Joseph and Henery are disgruntled about the situation, while Billy Smallbury and Mark Clark express admiration for her. They each express their views through a mix of direct statements, indirect implications, and reactions to others' comments." />

    <node id="1. After reading the marriage proposal letter, Boldwood experiences a range of emotions including excitement, anxiety, and obsession. He becomes preoccupied with the letter and its message, often staring at the red seal and imagining the words &quot;Marry me&quot; written on it. This fixation indicates his growing infatuation with Bathsheba.&#10;2. Boldwood's nervous excitability can be attributed to his uncertainty about Bathsheba's feelings towards him and the potential consequences of his actions. His overthinking of the situation and his strong emotions for her create an anxious state that manifests as restlessness, obsessive behavior, and difficulty sleeping.&#10;3. The contrast between Boldwood's quiet, routine life and the sudden introduction of a passionate desire for Bathsheba also contributes to his nervous excitability. This unexpected development disrupts his orderly existence, causing him stress and apprehension as he navigates these new feelings.&#10;4. Additionally, Boldwood is aware that his pursuit of Bathsheba may be perceived as inappropriate or coercive due to their age difference and her lack of involvement in initiating the relationship. This realization adds an extra layer of tension and unease to his emotional state." />
    <node id=" more might be found in the envelope than what he had&#10;withdrawn.  He jumped out of bed in the weird light, took the&#10;letter, pulled out the flimsy sheet, shook the envelope--searched it.&#10;Nothing more was there.  Boldwood looked, as he had a hundred times&#10;the preceding day, at the insistent red seal: &quot;Marry me,&quot; he said&#10;aloud.&#10;&#10;The solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the letter, and stuck&#10;it in the frame of the glass.  In doing so he caught sight of his&#10;reflected features, wan in expression, and insubstantial in form.&#10;He saw how closely compressed was his mouth, and that his eyes were&#10;wide-spread and vacant.  Feeling uneasy and dissatisfied with himself&#10;for this nervous excitability, he returned to bed.&#10;&#10;Then the dawn drew on.  The full power of the clear heaven was not&#10;equal to that of a cloudy sky at noon, when Boldwood arose and&#10;dressed himself.  He descended the stairs and went out towards the&#10;gate of a field to the east, leaning over which he paused and looked&#10;around.&#10;&#10;It was one of the usual slow sun" />
    <node id=" the letter and its dictum changed their&#10;tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity,&#10;imbibed from their accessories now.&#10;&#10;Since the receipt of the missive in the morning, Boldwood had felt&#10;the symmetry of his existence to be slowly getting distorted in the&#10;direction of an ideal passion.  The disturbance was as the first&#10;floating weed to Columbus--the contemptibly little suggesting&#10;possibilities of the infinitely great.&#10;&#10;The letter must have had an origin and a motive.  That the latter&#10;was of the smallest magnitude compatible with its existence at all,&#10;Boldwood, of course, did not know.  And such an explanation did not&#10;strike him as a possibility even.  It is foreign to a mystified&#10;condition of mind to realize of the mystifier that the processes of&#10;approving a course suggested by circumstance, and of striking out a&#10;course from inner impulse, would look the same in the result.  The&#10;vast difference between starting a train of events, and directing&#10;into a particular groove a series already started, is rarely apparent&#10;to the person confounded by the issue.&#10;&#10;When Boldwood went to bed he placed the valent" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;EFFECT OF THE LETTER--SUNRISE&#10;&#10;&#10;At dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine's Day, Boldwood sat down&#10;to supper as usual, by a beaming fire of aged logs.  Upon the&#10;mantel-shelf before him was a time-piece, surmounted by a spread&#10;eagle, and upon the eagle's wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent.&#10;Here the bachelor's gaze was continually fastening itself, till the&#10;large red seal became as a blot of blood on the retina of his eye;&#10;and as he ate and drank he still read in fancy the words thereon,&#10;although they were too remote for his sight--&#10;&#10;&#10;   &quot;MARRY ME.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;The pert injunction was like those crystal substances which,&#10;colourless themselves, assume the tone of objects about them.  Here,&#10;in the quiet of Boldwood's parlour, where everything that was not&#10;grave was extraneous, and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan&#10;Sunday lasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed their&#10;tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity,&#10;imbibed from their accessories now" />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba asks Gabriel Oak to contradict Mr. Boldwood's supposed statement about marrying him, indicating that she wants others to think there is nothing between them. This prompts Gabriel to reprimand her for behaving unworthily of a thoughtful, meek, and comely woman, which in turn makes Bathsheba angry.&#10;2. After their exchange, Bathsheba departs from Gabriel in a dignified manner because she is unsure of his true feelings towards her. She feels ambiguity regarding whether to pity him for his disappointed love or be angry with him for getting over it too easily. This leads to her resolution to never again act impulsively and cause such misunderstandings.&#10;3. Additionally, Bathsheba's departure is influenced by the realization that she is responsible for Mr. Boldwood's appearance at the farm, as well as Gabriel's observation that her behavior has implications beyond what she initially intended. The gravity of these situations contributes to Bathsheba's decision to leave with dignity and self-respect." />
    <node id="and not by sending him a valentine's letter.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba laid down the shears.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot allow any man to--to criticise my private conduct!&quot; she&#10;exclaimed.  &quot;Nor will I for a minute.  So you'll please leave the&#10;farm at the end of the week!&quot;&#10;&#10;It may have been a peculiarity--at any rate it was a fact--that when&#10;Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip&#10;trembled: when by a refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one.&#10;Her nether lip quivered now.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, so I will,&quot; said Gabriel calmly.  He had been held to&#10;her by a beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking,&#10;rather than by a chain he could not break.  &quot;I should be even better&#10;pleased to go at once,&quot; he added.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go at once then, in Heaven's name!&quot; said she, her eyes flashing at&#10;his, though never meeting them.  &quot;Don't let me see your face any&#10;more.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, Miss Everdene--so it shall" />

He said nothing.  She then broke out--&#10;&#10;&quot;I may ask, I suppose, where in particular my unworthiness lies?  In&#10;my not marrying you, perhaps!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not by any means,&quot; said Gabriel quietly.  &quot;I have long given up&#10;thinking of that matter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Or wishing it, I suppose,&quot; she said; and it was apparent that she&#10;expected an unhesitating denial of this supposition.&#10;&#10;Whatever Gabriel felt, he coolly echoed her words--&#10;&#10;&quot;Or wishing it either.&quot;&#10;&#10;A woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her,&#10;and with a rudeness which is not offensive.  Bathsheba would have&#10;submitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel&#10;protested that he was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity&#10;of passion unrequited" />
    <node id=" absolutely no&#10;other sound judgment within easy reach.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, what is your opinion of my conduct,&quot; she said, quietly.&#10;&#10;&quot;That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek, and comely woman.&quot;&#10;&#10;In an instant Bathsheba's face coloured with the angry crimson of&#10;a Danby sunset.  But she forbore to utter this feeling, and the&#10;reticence of her tongue only made the loquacity of her face the more&#10;noticeable.&#10;&#10;The next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps you don't like the rudeness of my reprimanding you, for I&#10;know it is rudeness; but I thought it would do good.&quot;&#10;&#10;She instantly replied sarcastically--&#10;&#10;&quot;On the contrary, my opinion of you is so low, that I see in your&#10;abuse the praise of discerning people!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad you don't mind it, for I said it honestly and with every&#10;serious meaning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I see.

The cabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to&#10;consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in misleading ways.  Every&#10;turn, look, word, and accent contained a mystery quite distinct from&#10;its obvious import, and not one had ever been pondered by him until&#10;now.&#10;&#10;As for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the belief that Farmer&#10;Boldwood had walked by on business or in idleness.  She collected&#10;the probabilities of the case, and concluded that she was herself&#10;responsible for Boldwood's appearance there.  It troubled her much&#10;to see what a great flame a little wildfire was likely to kindle.&#10;Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a&#10;trifler with the affections of men, and a censor's experience on&#10;seeing an actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling&#10;of surprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,&#10;and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be.&#10;&#10;She resolved never again" />
    <node id="The men were discussing Miss Everdene's (Bathsheba's) pride and vanity, which Mark Clark defended by expressing his admiration for her. Gabriel Oak became concerned about their conversation when he heard that they had been talking about their employer. He intervened forcefully to stop any disparaging remarks about Bathsheba, as he did not appreciate the &quot;dalliance-talk&quot; or criticism of her character from his fellow workers. This shows Oak's loyalty and respect towards Bathsheba, despite his disappointment in not being made the bailiff of her farm." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Gabriel Oak mentions that the lambing season has been particularly challenging this year due to frequent snow and rain. He states that he and Cainy Ball have been busy tending to the sheep twice a day for the past two weeks. Additionally, there have been an unusually high number of twin births, making their work even more strenuous.&#10;&#10;When Joseph Poorgrass inquires about the lambing progress, Gabriel compares it to the previous year and mentions that they were finished with lambing by Sexajessamine Sunday last year. However, this year, he believes they won't be done by Lady Day, indicating that the process has been prolonged due to the harsh weather conditions and higher number of twin births." />

He became&#10;surcharged with the compound, which was genuine lover's love.&#10;&#10;He approached the gate of the meadow.  Beyond it the ground was&#10;melodious with ripples, and the sky with larks; the low bleating of&#10;the flock mingling with both.  Mistress and man were engaged in the&#10;operation of making a lamb &quot;take,&quot; which is performed whenever an ewe&#10;has lost her own offspring, one of the twins of another ewe being&#10;given her as a substitute.  Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb, and&#10;was tying the skin over the body of the live lamb, in the customary&#10;manner, whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four&#10;hurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb were driven, where&#10;they would remain till the old sheep conceived an affection for the&#10;young one.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the manoeuvre and saw the&#10;farmer by the gate, where he was overhung by a willow tree in full&#10;bloom.

This change in season brings new life to the vegetation, making it more vibrant and noticeable.&#10;2. In the specific meadows that Farmer Boldwood is observing, there are three figures present: Miss Everdene, Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball. The group is engaged in some activity or interaction related to their work on the farm, with Gabriel Oak moving around vigorously like a black snuff against a candle-flame.&#10;3. Bathsheba Everdene, who is aware of Boldwood's presence, tries to avoid him due to his potentially severe or slighting demeanor. As she moves away from him, she hears footsteps behind her, indicating that Boldwood has followed her. This behavior suggests that Boldwood may have an interest in Bathsheba, although she remains unaware of the depth of his feelings at this point.&#10;4. The markings on the lambs' buttocks indicate that they belong to Farmer Bathsheba Everdene, reflecting her growing role and responsibilities as a farmer.&#10;5. Boldwood is deeply affected by an anonymous Valentine he received, which he initially mistook as being for him or his shepherd but later discovered was actually addressed to Gabriel Oak. This revelation and Oak's subsequent confusion make Boldwood suspicious of some sort of coquettish behavior between Oak and Miss Everdene." />
    <node id=" early spring--the time of going to grass with the sheep,&#10;when they have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid&#10;up for mowing.  The wind, which had been blowing east for several&#10;weeks, had veered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come&#10;abruptly--almost without a beginning.  It was that period in the&#10;vernal quarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the&#10;season.  The vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to&#10;rise, till in the completest silence of lone gardens and trackless&#10;plantations, where everything seems helpless and still after the&#10;bond and slavery of frost, there are bustlings, strainings, united&#10;thrusts, and pulls-all-together, in comparison with which the&#10;powerful tugs of cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy&#10;efforts.&#10;&#10;Boldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw there three figures.&#10;They were those of Miss Everdene, Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.&#10;&#10;When Bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's eyes it lighted him&#10;up as the" />

They believe that she is making a mistake by thinking she can handle things on her own, as both Henery and Mark Clark consider her hasty and headstrong. &#10;&#10;Mark Clark also fears that Bathsheba's decision will lead to ruin for the workers (referred to as &quot;ourselves&quot; in his statement) because they believe she lacks the necessary experience and wisdom to run a farm efficiently, which could negatively impact their own livelihoods. This is evident when Mark Clark says, &quot;All will be ruined, and ourselves too.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Henery and Mark Clark are worried about Bathsheba's decision to manage her farm without a bailiff due to her perceived lack of experience and the potential negative consequences for both her and her workers." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;She'll rue it--surely, surely!&quot; he said.  &quot;Benjy Pennyways were not&#10;a true man or an honest baily--as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot&#10;himself.

    <node id="The scene described is a group of villagers, including Mr. Boldwood, several other men, and Bathsheba, gathered near a pool on a moist mead. It is early spring, and the trees around them have new, soft, and moist leaves that are yellow and green in color. The loud notes of cuckoos can be heard from the trees. Bathsheba is standing by her horse, which is looped to her arm, and flagons of cider are rolling about on the grass. All of the people there, including Mr. Boldwood, are wet to their roots, suggesting that they have recently been in the water." />
    <node id=" flexible palisade upon its moist&#10;brink.  To the north of the mead were trees, the leaves of which&#10;were new, soft, and moist, not yet having stiffened and darkened&#10;under summer sun and drought, their colour being yellow beside a&#10;green--green beside a yellow.  From the recesses of this knot of&#10;foliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the&#10;still air.&#10;&#10;Boldwood went meditating down the slopes with his eyes on his boots,&#10;which the yellow pollen from the buttercups had bronzed in artistic&#10;gradations.  A tributary of the main stream flowed through the&#10;basin of the pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its&#10;diameter.  Shepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poorgrass, Cain Ball,&#10;and several others were assembled here, all dripping wet to the&#10;very roots of their hair, and Bathsheba was standing by in a new&#10;riding-habit--the most elegant she had ever worn--the reins of her&#10;horse being looped over her arm.  Flagons of cider were rolling about&#10;upon the green.  The meek sheep were" />
    <node id=" that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,&#10;and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be.&#10;&#10;She resolved never again, by look or by sign, to interrupt the steady&#10;flow of this man's life.  But a resolution to avoid an evil is&#10;seldom framed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance&#10;impossible.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE SHEEP-WASHING--THE OFFER&#10;&#10;&#10;Boldwood did eventually call upon her.  She was not at home.  &quot;Of&#10;course not,&quot; he murmured.  In contemplating Bathsheba as a woman, he&#10;had forgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist--that&#10;being as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as himself,&#10;her probable whereabouts was out-of-doors at this time of the year.&#10;This, and the other oversights Boldwood was guilty of, were natural&#10;to the mood, and still more natural to the circumstances.  The&#10;great aids to idealization in love were present here: occasional&#10;observation of her from a distance, and the absence of social&#10;intercourse with her--visual familiarity, oral strangeness." />
    <node id="Based on Boldwood's blank reaction to Bathsheba's presence and his subsequent infatuation with her, it can be inferred that he may not have had much experience with women or romantic relationships. His limited interactions with the opposite sex might explain his hesitance and awkwardness around her, as well as his difficulty in understanding social cues and initiating a relationship.&#10;&#10;The narrator's comment on the disproportionate effects of minimal causes in mental movements is directly related to Boldwood's situation. Despite having only occasional observations of Bathsheba from a distance and limited oral interaction with her, Boldwood becomes increasingly obsessed with her. This observation demonstrates how small initial triggers can lead to significant consequences in human behavior and emotions, particularly in the context of love and romantic attraction. The minimal cause in this case is Boldwood's initial encounter with Bathsheba, which eventually leads to his intense infatuation and proposal." />
    <node id=" to&#10;the difference between approving of what circumstances suggest, and&#10;originating what they do not suggest, was well matched by Bathsheba's&#10;insensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings.&#10;&#10;She was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer,&#10;adding up accounts with him as indifferently as if his face had been&#10;the pages of a ledger.  It was evident that such a nature as his had&#10;no attraction for a woman of Bathsheba's taste.  But Boldwood grew&#10;hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy; he trod for the&#10;first time the threshold of &quot;the injured lover's hell.&quot;  His first&#10;impulse was to go and thrust himself between them.  This could be&#10;done, but only in one way--by asking to see a sample of her corn.&#10;Boldwood renounced the idea.  He could not make the request; it was&#10;debasing loveliness to ask it to buy and sell, and jarred with his&#10;conceptions of her.&#10;&#10;All this time Bathsheba was conscious of having broken into that&#10;dignified stronghold at last.  His eyes, she knew, were following her&#10;" />
    <node id="Bathsheba did not want to marry Mr. Boldwood because her feelings towards him were based on esteem and liking, but she did not have any passion or desire for marriage in general or for possessing him. She felt a sense of responsibility since she had unintentionally encouraged his affections, and recognized that turning down his proposal would be considered ungenerous by some. However, her independent position as the absolute mistress of a farm and house was still new and exciting to her, making it difficult for her to give up her autonomy for marriage. Additionally, she wanted others to perceive her as thoughtful, meek, and comely, so she asked Gabriel Oak to contradict any rumors about a relationship with Boldwood, further emphasizing her lack of interest in marrying him. Ultimately, Bathsheba's decision reflects her genuine feelings and personal preferences, rather than societal expectations or material benefits." />
    <node id="did not exercise kindness, here.  The rarest offerings of the purest&#10;loves are but a self-indulgence, and no generosity at all.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was eventually able&#10;to look calmly at his offer.  It was one which many women of her own&#10;station in the neighbourhood, and not a few of higher rank, would&#10;have been wild to accept and proud to publish.  In every point of&#10;view, ranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable that she,&#10;a lonely girl, should marry, and marry this earnest, well-to-do,&#10;and respected man.  He was close to her doors: his standing was&#10;sufficient: his qualities were even supererogatory.  Had she felt,&#10;which she did not, any wish whatever for the married state in the&#10;abstract, she could not reasonably have rejected him, being a woman&#10;who frequently appealed to her understanding for deliverance from&#10;her whims.  Boldwood as a means to marriage was unexceptionable: she&#10;esteemed and liked him, yet she did not want him.  It appears that&#10;ordinary men take wives because possession is not" />
    <node id=" unexceptionable: she&#10;esteemed and liked him, yet she did not want him.  It appears that&#10;ordinary men take wives because possession is not possible without&#10;marriage, and that ordinary women accept husbands because marriage&#10;is not possible without possession; with totally differing aims the&#10;method is the same on both sides.  But the understood incentive on&#10;the woman's part was wanting here.  Besides, Bathsheba's position&#10;as absolute mistress of a farm and house was a novel one, and the&#10;novelty had not yet begun to wear off.&#10;&#10;But a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her credit, for it&#10;would have affected few.  Beyond the mentioned reasons with which&#10;she combated her objections, she had a strong feeling that, having&#10;been the one who began the game, she ought in honesty to accept the&#10;consequences.  Still the reluctance remained.  She said in the same&#10;breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry Boldwood, and that&#10;she couldn't do it to save her life.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a deliberative aspect.  An&#10;Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart in spirit, she" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, Boldwood's manner of looking at Bathsheba can be interpreted as intense admiration and infatuation. This is evident in his fixation on her presence and the significant impact she has had on him since their first encounter. The narrator's comment about minimal causes having disproportionate effects in mental movements directly relates to Boldwood's situation, as his initial observations of Bathsheba from a distance have led to an obsessive interest in her.&#10;&#10;This dynamic mirrors the story of Adam's awakening in that both situations involve one individual having a profound effect on another person's emotional and mental state. Just as Eve became the center of Adam's world, Bathsheba has become the focus of Boldwood's attention and emotions.&#10;&#10;The text also describes how small initial triggers can lead to significant consequences in human behavior and emotions, particularly in the context of love and romantic attraction. In this case, Boldwood's infatuation with Bathsheba serves as an example of how minimal causes (his occasional observations of her) can have disproportionate emotional effects (his intense obsession).&#10;&#10;In summary, Boldwood's manner of looking at Bathsheba suggests deep admiration and infatuation, which is consistent with the narrator's comment about minimal causes having disproportionate effects in mental movements. This dynamic mirrors the story of Adam's awakening, where one individual has a profound impact on another person's emotional and mental state." />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba asks Gabriel to leave the farm due to her anger and loss of temper during their conversation about her private conduct. She feels that he has criticized her by implying she behaved unworthily, which she interprets as a lack of respect for her decision not to marry him. Additionally, she may feel uncomfortable working with Gabriel after their disagreement and his reprimand.&#10;&#10;2. Gabriel decides to leave immediately after their argument because he feels that the bond between them has been damaged by their disagreement. He had previously stayed on the farm out of loyalty and respect for Bathsheba, but their conflict and her subsequent request for him to leave make it too difficult for him to continue working there. Furthermore, his calm and dignified response to her request shows his continued respect for her despite their differences." />
    <node id="The unnamed man mentioned here is Mr. Boldwood. He is depicted as a serious and emotionally intense individual who becomes deeply affected by his feelings for Bathsheba. The &quot;single action&quot; that Bathsheba unintentionally initiates is her decision to showcase her independence by foolishly sending him a valentine, which ultimately triggers his intense infatuation with her. This infatuation leads to his proposal and subsequent emotional instability when he realizes the complexity of his emotions. The narrator's description of Boldwood's internal struggles mirrors the story of Adam's awakening in how one individual can have a profound impact on another person's emotional and mental state." />
    <node id="1. Receiving the mysterious love letter significantly altered Boldwood's perspective, as he became increasingly preoccupied with the message and its implications. The letter sparked an ideal passion within him, distorting his previously symmetrical existence.&#10;2. Boldwood attributed great importance to the letter and its origin, believing it to be a deliberate act of courtship rather than a prank. He was unable to consider the possibility that the motive behind the letter might have been insignificant due to his mystified state of mind.&#10;3. The moonlight illuminating Boldwood's bedroom in an unusual way further emphasized the transformative power of the letter, casting strange shadows and highlighting its presence.&#10;4. Boldwood's lack of experience with women or romantic relationships might have contributed to his infatuation with Bathsheba, as he struggled to understand social cues and initiate a relationship.&#10;5. The narrator's comment on the disproportionate effects of minimal causes in mental movements is evident in Boldwood's situation, where a small initial trigger (the letter) led to significant emotional consequences (his intense infatuation)." />
    <node id="Cain Ball rushed to inform Shepherd Oak about the twin births because he knew that this information was important and required immediate attention. As assistant shepherds, both Gabriel Oak and Cain Ball were responsible for monitoring the lambing sheep, especially since the lambing season had been particularly challenging due to harsh weather conditions and an unusually high number of twins. When Cain realizes that two more ewes have given birth to twins, he quickly runs to inform Oak so they could tend to the newborn lambs as soon as possible, ensuring their health and survival. This urgency also stemmed from the fact that Cain and Oak had been busy tending to the sheep twice a day for the past two weeks, and their workload would increase with each new birth." />
    <node id="Joseph Poorgrass finds it challenging to remember the correct orientation of the letters &quot;J&quot; and &quot;E&quot; when marking Farmer James Everdene's wagon because they are mirror images of each other, and he has a poor memory for such details. He admits that these letters are &quot;such trying sons o' witches for the memory to mind whether they face backward or forward,&quot; making it difficult for him to distinguish between them in different orientations. This difficulty contributes to his confusion when writing the name &quot;JAMES EVERDENE&quot; on the wagon, sometimes printing the &quot;J&quot; and &quot;E&quot; backward, which would cause the name to appear as &quot;SEMAJ YREDNE.&quot; As a result, Farmer James Everdene would reprimand Joseph for making this mistake." />
    <node id="great long tails.  A excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever&#10;man, shepherd.  Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer James&#10;Everdene's waggons before you came, and 'a could never mind which way&#10;to turn the J's and E's--could ye, Joseph?&quot; Joseph shook his head&#10;to express how absolute was the fact that he couldn't.  &quot;And so you&#10;used to do 'em the wrong way, like this, didn't ye, Joseph?&quot; Matthew&#10;marked on the dusty floor with his whip-handle&#10;&#10;&#10;   [the word J A M E S appears here with the &quot;J&quot; and the &quot;E&quot;&#10;   printed backwards]&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how Farmer James would cuss, and call thee a fool, wouldn't he,&#10;Joseph, when 'a seed his name looking so inside-out-like?&quot; continued&#10;Matthew Moon with feeling.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay--'a would,&quot; said Joseph, meekly.  &quot;But, you see, I wasn't so much&#10;to blame, for them J's and E's be such trying sons o' witches for the&#10;memory to mind whether they face backward or forward; and I" />
    <node id="The first man in the parish who prophesies ill (speaks negatively) of their mistress, Miss Everdene, is worthy of a strong rebuke from the shepherd, Gabriel Oak, because Oak strongly believes in loyalty and respect for their employer. This stern action from Oak makes Joseph Poorgrass more cautious about speaking against their employer.&#10;&#10;This situation reveals that Oak has a reputation as an extraordinary good and clever man, as Poorgrass and others defer to his judgment and authority. Poorgrass, in particular, is anxious about speaking negatively of Miss Everdene because he fears retribution or consequences for doing so. This dynamic also highlights the power dynamics present in the community, with Oak serving as a respected figure who maintains order and loyalty among the workers." />
    <node id="1. Cainy Ball has delivered two more lambs, which required immediate attention from Shepherd Oak. This information prompted Oak to leave his conversation with the ancient man of malt and hurry to tend to the newborn lambs, ensuring their survival by warming them up near the fire.&#10;   &#10;2. Gabriel Oak feels that not having a lambing-hut at his current location is problematic because it makes bringing weak lambs to a house for warmth and care more difficult, especially in cold weather conditions. He mentions that he used to have a lambing-hut at Norcombe, implying that it was helpful in managing lambing seasons.&#10;&#10;3. The ancient man of malt is pleased to see Gabriel Oak sitting down with him. He expresses his interest in the old place at Norcombe and asks about its current state, showing a sense of nostalgia and curiosity about the familiar spot." />

The striking of the clock seemed to quicken the flight of time, making it seem extraordinary. When the quarter-jack struck half-past eleven, some of the spectators wondered where the woman was. The young sergeant stood still with abnormal rigidity, facing the south-east and remaining silent and still.

Some persons may have noticed how&#10;extraordinarily the striking of quarters seems to quicken the flight&#10;of time.  It was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with&#10;the minutes when the rattle began again, the puppet emerged, and the&#10;four quarters were struck fitfully as before.

The step echoed with a ring&#10;unusual in a church; it was the clink of spurs.  Everybody looked.  A&#10;young cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons of a&#10;sergeant upon his sleeve, strode up the aisle, with an embarrassment&#10;which was only the more marked by the intense vigour of his step, and&#10;by the determination upon his face to show none.  A slight flush had&#10;mounted his cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these&#10;women; but, passing on through the chancel arch, he never paused till&#10;he came close to the altar railing.  Here for a moment he stood&#10;alone.&#10;&#10;The officiating curate, who had not yet doffed his surplice,&#10;perceived the new-comer, and followed him to the communion-space.

He&#10;again placed the letter on the mantelpiece, and sat down to think of&#10;the circumstances attending it by the light of Gabriel's information.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;ALL SAINTS' AND ALL SOULS'&#10;&#10;&#10;On a week-day morning a small congregation, consisting mainly of&#10;women and girls, rose from its knees in the mouldy nave of a church&#10;called All Saints', in the distant barrack-town before-mentioned, at&#10;the end of a service without a sermon.

The&#10;young man on leaving the door went to cross the square, when, in the&#10;middle, he met a little woman.  The expression of her face, which had&#10;been one of intense anxiety, sank at the sight of his nearly to&#10;terror.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well?&quot; he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly looking at her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Frank--I made a mistake!--I thought that church with the spire&#10;was All Saints', and I was at the door at half-past eleven to a&#10;minute as you said.

She met him when she left Weatherbury &quot;in a reckless way,&quot; and he provided assistance and kindness to her during that time.&#10;2. The purpose of her message is to thank Oak for his help and return the money he lent her. She also wants to inform him about her upcoming marriage to Sergeant Troy, a man from the 11th Dragoon Guards.&#10;3. Fanny addresses the letter as &quot;Dear Friend&quot; because she does not know Oak's name but is grateful for his help and wishes to maintain some level of anonymity while expressing her gratitude.&#10;4. It is important to note that, unbeknownst to both Fanny and Gabriel, Boldwood intercepts the letter and assumes it is meant for him as a declaration of love or courtship from Bathsheba Everdene. This misinterpretation sets the stage for further complications in the story." />

All has ended well,&#10;   and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young&#10;   man who has courted me for some time--Sergeant Troy, of&#10;   the 11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in this town.  He&#10;   would, I know, object to my having received anything except&#10;   as a loan, being a man of great respectability and high&#10;   honour--indeed, a nobleman by blood.&#10;&#10;   I should be much obliged to you if you would keep the&#10;   contents of this letter a secret for the present, dear&#10;   friend.  We mean to surprise Weatherbury by coming there&#10;   soon as husband and wife, though I blush to state it to one&#10; " />

The form&#10;of Henery Fray advanced to the fire, stamping the snow from his boots&#10;when about half-way there.  The speech and entry had not seemed to be&#10;at all an abrupt beginning to the maltster, introductory matter being&#10;often omitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and deed, and&#10;the maltster having the same latitude allowed him, did not hurry to&#10;reply.  He picked up a fragment of cheese, by pecking upon it with&#10;his knife, as a butcher picks up skewers.&#10;&#10;Henery" />
    <node id="The scene described is set in a moist mead where a group of villagers, including Mr. Boldwood and Bathsheba, have gathered near a pool. It is early spring, and the trees around them have new, soft, and moist leaves that are yellow and green in color. The loud notes of cuckoos can be heard from the trees. Bathsheba is standing by her horse, which is looped to her arm, and flagons of cider are rolling about on the grass. All of the people there, including Mr. Boldwood, are wet to their roots, suggesting that they have recently been in the water." />
    <node id="1. The act of Bathsheba taking over the handle of the grindstone and asking Gabriel to apply the shears can be seen as a symbol of her desire for control and autonomy in their relationship. By physically occupying the position of power and asking Gabriel to perform the task that he had previously been doing, Bathsheba is asserting her independence and challenging his authority.&#10;2. Additionally, the fact that they discuss something privately while working together on the grindstone can also be seen as a way for them to connect and communicate on a more equal footing. The physical intimacy required to sharpen the shears may help to create a sense of closeness between them, even as they navigate their differences and misunderstandings.&#10;3. Finally, the act of working together on the grindstone can also be seen as a metaphor for the ways in which communication and collaboration are necessary for resolving conflicts and building stronger relationships. By working together to sharpen the shears, Bathsheba and Gabriel are able to engage in a productive dialogue that ultimately helps them to better understand each other's perspectives and come to a mutual understanding." />

Oak stood somewhat as Eros is represented when in the act of&#10;sharpening his arrows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his&#10;body thrown over on the shears, and his head balanced side-ways, with&#10;a critical compression of the lips and contraction of the eyelids to&#10;crown the attitude.&#10;&#10;His mistress came up and looked upon them in silence for a minute or&#10;two; then she said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Cain, go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare.  I'll turn the&#10;winch of the grindstone.  I want to speak to you, Gabriel.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cain departed, and Bathsheba took the handle.  Gabriel had glanced up&#10;in intense surprise, quelled its expression, and looked down again.&#10;Bathsheba turned the winch, and Gabriel applied the shears.&#10;&#10;The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful&#10;tendency to benumb the mind.  It is a sort of attenuated variety" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, they did,&quot; said Gabriel.  &quot;You don't hold the shears right,&#10;miss--I knew you wouldn't know the way--hold like this.&quot;&#10;&#10;He relinquished the winch, and inclosing her two hands completely in&#10;his own (taking each as we sometimes slap a child's hand in teaching&#10;him to write), grasped the shears with her.  &quot;Incline the edge so,&quot;&#10;he said.&#10;&#10;Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words, and held thus for a&#10;peculiarly long time by the instructor as he spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;That will do,&quot; exclaimed Bathsheba.  &quot;Loose my hands.  I won't have&#10;them held!  Turn the winch.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel freed her hands quietly, retired to his handle, and the&#10;grinding went on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Did the men think it odd?&quot; she said again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Odd was not the idea, miss.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What did they say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That Farmer Boldwood's name and your own were likely to be flung&#10;over pulpit together before the year was out.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought so by the look" />
    <node id="The maltster typically starts his day by lying down in his clothes for a few hours before sitting down for breakfast. His breakfast consists of bread and bacon, which he eats using the &quot;plateless system.&quot; This system involves placing a slice of bread on the table, followed by meat on top of the bread, then a mustard plaster, and finally a pinch of salt. He then cuts through the whole stack vertically with a large pocket-knife until he reaches the wood beneath. The maltster has no teeth, having lost them many years ago, but this does not seem to hinder his eating abilities, as toothlessness is treated more like an acquisition due to his hard gums. His approach to life and aging is compared to a hyperbolic curve approaching a straight line, indicating that he seems to be getting younger rather than older." />

This was eaten on the plateless system, which is&#10;performed by placing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat&#10;upon the bread, a mustard plaster upon the meat, and a pinch of salt&#10;upon the whole, then cutting them vertically downwards with a large&#10;pocket-knife till wood is reached, when the severed lump is impaled&#10;on the knife, elevated, and sent the proper way of food.&#10;&#10;The maltster's lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly diminish&#10;his powers as a mill.  He had been without them for so many years&#10;that toothlessness was felt less to be a defect than hard gums an&#10;acquisition.  Indeed, he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic&#10;curve approaches a straight line--less directly as he got nearer,&#10;till it was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all.&#10;" />
    <node id="Mr. Boldwood declares his love for Bathsheba due to his unintentional feelings of affection that developed after seeing her and being captivated by her presence. His admiration grew over time, and he had never considered marriage until then. The age difference between them does not deter him, as he believes he can provide good care for her as a husband.&#10;&#10;His hope that Bathsheba feels the same way leads him to propose, even though it is not in response to any action or signal from her. Boldwood's love for Bathsheba stems solely from his own emotions and the impact she has had on him since they met.&#10;&#10;He asks Bathsheba not to reject him outright if she cannot reciprocate his feelings because of his vulnerability and fear of public humiliation. Rejection would confirm that his affections are unreturned, which could negatively affect his social standing in the community. By making this request, Boldwood reveals his emotional intensity and sensitivity, highlighting the depth of his infatuation with Bathsheba." />

Bathsheba asks Gabriel Oak to contradict Mr. Boldwood's supposed statement about marrying him, indicating that she wants others to think there is nothing between them. This prompts Gabriel to reprimand her for behaving unworthily of a thoughtful, meek, and comely woman, which in turn makes Bathsheba angry.&#10;2. After their exchange, Bathsheba departs from Gabriel in a dignified manner because she is unsure of his true feelings towards her. She feels ambiguity regarding whether to pity him for his disappointed love or be angry with him for getting over it too easily. This leads to her resolution to never again act impulsively and cause such misunderstandings.&#10;3. Additionally, Bathsheba's departure is influenced by the realization that she is responsible for Mr. Boldwood's appearance at the farm, as well as Gabriel's observation that her behavior has implications beyond what she initially intended.

The act of Bathsheba taking over the handle of the grindstone and asking Gabriel to apply the shears can be seen as a symbol of her desire for control and autonomy in their relationship.

The physical intimacy required to sharpen the shears may help to create a sense of closeness between them, even as they navigate their differences and misunderstandings.&#10;3. Finally, the act of working together on the grindstone can also be seen as a metaphor for the ways in which communication and collaboration are necessary for resolving conflicts and building stronger relationships.

His overthinking of the situation and his strong emotions for her create an anxious state that manifests as restlessness, obsessive behavior, and difficulty sleeping.&#10;3. The contrast between Boldwood's quiet, routine life and the sudden introduction of a passionate desire for Bathsheba also contributes to his nervous excitability. This unexpected development disrupts his orderly existence, causing him stress and apprehension as he navigates these new feelings.&#10;4. Additionally, Boldwood is aware that his pursuit of Bathsheba may be perceived as inappropriate or coercive due to their age difference and her lack of involvement in initiating the relationship.

After their exchange, Bathsheba departs from Gabriel in a dignified manner because she is unsure of his true feelings towards her. She feels ambiguity regarding whether to pity him for his disappointed love or be angry with him for getting over it too easily. This leads to her resolution to never again act impulsively and cause such misunderstandings.&#10;3.

The narrator's comment about minimal causes having disproportionate effects in mental movements directly relates to Boldwood's situation, as his initial observations of Bathsheba from a distance have led to an obsessive interest in her.&#10;&#10;This dynamic mirrors the story of Adam's awakening in that both situations involve one individual having a profound effect on another person's emotional and mental state.

She felt a sense of responsibility since she had unintentionally encouraged his affections, and recognized that turning down his proposal would be considered ungenerous by some. However, her independent position as the absolute mistress of a farm and house was still new and exciting to her, making it difficult for her to give up her autonomy for marriage. Additionally, she wanted others to perceive her as thoughtful, meek, and comely, so she asked Gabriel Oak to contradict any rumors about a relationship with Boldwood, further emphasizing her lack of interest in marrying him. Ultimately, Bathsheba's decision reflects her genuine feelings and personal preferences, rather than societal expectations or material benefits." target="Mr. Boldwood declares his love for Bathsheba due to his unintentional feelings of affection that developed after seeing her and being captivated by her presence. His admiration grew over time, and he had never considered marriage until then. The age difference between them does not deter him, as he believes he can provide good care for her as a husband.&#10;&#10;His hope that Bathsheba feels the same way leads him to propose, even though it is not in response to any action or signal from her. Boldwood's love for Bathsheba stems solely from his own emotions and the impact she has had on him since they met.&#10;&#10;He asks Bathsheba not to reject him outright if she cannot reciprocate his feelings because of his vulnerability and fear of public humiliation. Rejection would confirm that his affections are unreturned, which could negatively affect his social standing in the community. By making this request, Boldwood reveals his emotional intensity and sensitivity, highlighting the depth of his infatuation with Bathsheba.">

    <edge source="Based on the information provided, Boldwood's manner of looking at Bathsheba can be interpreted as intense admiration and infatuation. This is evident in his fixation on her presence and the significant impact she has had on him since their first encounter. The narrator's comment about minimal causes having disproportionate effects in mental movements directly relates to Boldwood's situation, as his initial observations of Bathsheba from a distance have led to an obsessive interest in her.&#10;&#10;This dynamic mirrors the story of Adam's awakening in that both situations involve one individual having a profound effect on another person's emotional and mental state. Just as Eve became the center of Adam's world, Bathsheba has become the focus of Boldwood's attention and emotions.&#10;&#10;The text also describes how small initial triggers can lead to significant consequences in human behavior and emotions, particularly in the context of love and romantic attraction. In this case, Boldwood's infatuation with Bathsheba serves as an example of how minimal causes (his occasional observations of her) can have disproportionate emotional effects (his intense obsession).&#10;&#10;In summary, Boldwood's manner of looking at Bathsheba suggests deep admiration and infatuation, which is consistent with the narrator's comment about minimal causes having disproportionate effects in mental movements. This dynamic mirrors the story of Adam's awakening, where one individual has a profound impact on another person's emotional and mental state." target="The unnamed man mentioned here is Mr. Boldwood. He is depicted as a serious and emotionally intense individual who becomes deeply affected by his feelings for Bathsheba. The &quot;single action&quot; that Bathsheba unintentionally initiates is her decision to showcase her independence by foolishly sending him a valentine, which ultimately triggers his intense infatuation with her. This infatuation leads to his proposal and subsequent emotional instability when he realizes the complexity of his emotions. The narrator's description of Boldwood's internal struggles mirrors the story of Adam's awakening in how one individual can have a profound impact on another person's emotional and mental state.">

    <edge source="1. Bathsheba asks Gabriel to leave the farm due to her anger and loss of temper during their conversation about her private conduct. She feels that he has criticized her by implying she behaved unworthily, which she interprets as a lack of respect for her decision not to marry him. Additionally, she may feel uncomfortable working with Gabriel after their disagreement and his reprimand.&#10;&#10;2. Gabriel decides to leave immediately after their argument because he feels that the bond between them has been damaged by their disagreement. He had previously stayed on the farm out of loyalty and respect for Bathsheba, but their conflict and her subsequent request for him to leave make it too difficult for him to continue working there. Furthermore, his calm and dignified response to her request shows his continued respect for her despite their differences." target="1. The act of Bathsheba taking over the handle of the grindstone and asking Gabriel to apply the shears can be seen as a symbol of her desire for control and autonomy in their relationship. By physically occupying the position of power and asking Gabriel to perform the task that he had previously been doing, Bathsheba is asserting her independence and challenging his authority.&#10;2. Additionally, the fact that they discuss something privately while working together on the grindstone can also be seen as a way for them to connect and communicate on a more equal footing. The physical intimacy required to sharpen the shears may help to create a sense of closeness between them, even as they navigate their differences and misunderstandings.&#10;3. Finally, the act of working together on the grindstone can also be seen as a metaphor for the ways in which communication and collaboration are necessary for resolving conflicts and building stronger relationships. By working together to sharpen the shears, Bathsheba and Gabriel are able to engage in a productive dialogue that ultimately helps them to better understand each other's perspectives and come to a mutual understanding.">

The letter sparked an ideal passion within him, distorting his previously symmetrical existence.&#10;2. Boldwood attributed great importance to the letter and its origin, believing it to be a deliberate act of courtship rather than a prank. He was unable to consider the possibility that the motive behind the letter might have been insignificant due to his mystified state of mind.&#10;3.

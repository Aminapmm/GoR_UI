    <node id="The young Durbeyfield children are depicted as entirely dependent on their parents for their well-being and survival. They are described as &quot;passengers in the Durbeyfield ship&quot; with no agency or control over their own lives. This dependence is highlighted when the narrator states, &quot;If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation, death, thither were these half-dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them.&quot; The text suggests that the children's fate is tied to the decisions made by their parents, and they are at risk of facing hardships and challenges if their parents fail to make responsible choices.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the text emphasizes that the children have never been asked if they wish for life or not, highlighting their vulnerability and lack of power in their own lives. The author's tone seems critical of this situation, suggesting that it is unfair and unjust. This critique is further supported by the mention of the Durbeyfield family's once-noble status, which has now been reduced to poverty, indicating a fall from grace and highlighting the harsh realities faced by the children due to their parents' circumstances.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the text emphasizes that the young Durbeyfield children are entirely dependent on their parents for their well-being and survival.

The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many&#10;years, under the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor,&#10;that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk&#10;accompanied each swing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to&#10;side like a weaver's shuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her&#10;song, trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after&#10;a long day's seething in the suds.&#10;&#10;Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched&#10;itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from&#10;the matron's elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the&#10;verse," />

How to break the news was more than she&#10;could think.  It was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of&#10;her parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not&#10;lessen the self-reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for&#10;her negligence.&#10;&#10;But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune&#10;a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving&#10;family, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it&#10;would only have meant inconvenience.  In the Durbeyfield countenances&#10;there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the&#10;girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare.  Nobody blamed Tess&#10;as she blamed herself.&#10;&#10;When it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a&#10;very few shillings for Prince's carcase because of his decrepitude,&#10;Durbeyfield rose to the occasion.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said he stoically" />

Tess took it up, and her mother started.&#10;&#10;This going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of&#10;Mrs Durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of&#10;rearing children.  To discover him at Rolliver's, to sit there for&#10;an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the&#10;children during the interval, made her happy.

    <node id="The strange noises that awakened Tess from her sleep were a hollow groan and a shout of &quot;Hoi there!&quot; These noises were caused by the fact that the morning mail-cart, which had wheels that were much noiseless than those of Tess's wagon, had collided with her unlighted wagon. The pointed shaft of the mail-cart had pierced through her father's poor horse, Prince, and his life's blood was spouting out in a stream.

Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill&#10;self-reproach that she had not returned sooner, to help her mother&#10;in these domesticities, instead of indulging herself out-of-doors.&#10;&#10;There stood her mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left&#10;her, hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always,&#10;lingered on to the end of the week.

The youngsters,&#10;not immediately within sight, seemed rather bright and desirable&#10;appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents of daily life were not&#10;without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there.  She felt a&#10;little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband&#10;in the same spot during his wooing, shutting her eyes to his defects&#10;of character, and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as&#10;lover.&#10;&#10;Tess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the&#10;outhouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the&#10;thatch.  A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part&#10;of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all&#10;night, and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted.&#10;Between the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions,&#10;folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the" />

A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke&#10;from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen.&#10;&#10;They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness,&#10;and the waggon had stopped.

Something&#10;terrible had happened.  The harness was entangled with an object&#10;which blocked the way.&#10;&#10;In consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth.&#10;The groan had proceeded from her father's poor horse Prince.  The&#10;morning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along&#10;these lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow&#10;and unlighted equipage.  The pointed shaft of the cart had entered&#10;the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his&#10;life's blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into&#10;the road.&#10;&#10;In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole,&#10;with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with&#10;the crimson drops.

    <node id="&#10;&#10;On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking&#10;homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining&#10;Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor.  The pair of legs that carried him&#10;were rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him&#10;somewhat to the left of a straight line.  He occasionally gave a&#10;smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not&#10;thinking of anything in particular.  An empty egg-basket was slung&#10;upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite&#10;worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off.&#10;Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare,&#10;who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good night t'ee,&quot; said the man with the basket.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good night, Sir John,&quot; said the parson.&#10;&#10;The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on" />

I am Parson&#10;Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane.

An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad&#10;weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous,&#10;and miry ways.&#10;&#10;This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are&#10;never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the&#10;bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,&#10;Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High" />

The two elder of&#10;the brothers were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment,&#10;but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners&#10;seemed to amuse the third, and make him in no hurry to move on.  He&#10;unstrapped his knapsack, put it, with his stick, on the hedge-bank,&#10;and opened the gate.&#10;&#10;&quot;What are you going to do, Angel?&quot; asked the eldest.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am inclined to go and have a fling with them.

You've had enough&#10;already.&quot;  Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts&#10;as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.&#10;&#10;When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound&#10;reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside,&#10;depositing his basket before him.  In a few minutes a youth appeared&#10;in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been&#10;pursued by Durbeyfield.  The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand,&#10;and the lad quickened his pace and came near.&#10;&#10;&quot;Boy, take up that basket!  I want 'ee to go on an errand for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;The lath-like stripling frowned. " />
    <node id="Mrs. Durbeyfield believes that it would be beneficial for her daughter Tess to visit and connect with a wealthy, distant relative because she thinks that this connection could lead to a &quot;noble gentleman marrying her,&quot; which could improve the family's social and economic status.

He also wants to ride in her coach and wear black clothes, indicating his excitement about the possibility of being associated with wealth and status.

    <node id="Prince, Tess's father's horse, was struck by the mail-cart's sharp shaft, which pierced through him and caused his life's blood to spout out. Tess had unknowingly traveled further than intended while she was asleep, and the collision occurred when the mail-cart came upon her unlit wagon. The driver of the mail-cart told Tess to stay with the wagon and that he would send help as soon as possible. As dawn arrives, Tess stands beside Prince's dead body, which is entangled in the harness, and a large pool of blood forms on the road. Her father and siblings eventually arrive at the scene, and they take the body back home with them. The family seems to regard themselves as having weightier concerns than common folks due to this incident, hinting at their different social status. Tess feels guilty and believes she is responsible for Prince's death. Throughout these events, she remains dry-eyed and pale, showing a remarkable acceptance of her circumstances despite her inner turmoil." />
    <node id="  Then she stood helplessly looking on.  Prince&#10;also stood firm and motionless as long as he could; till he suddenly&#10;sank down in a heap.&#10;&#10;By this time the mail-cart man had joined her, and began dragging and&#10;unharnessing the hot form of Prince.  But he was already dead, and,&#10;seeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man&#10;returned to his own animal, which was uninjured.&#10;&#10;&quot;You was on the wrong side,&quot; he said.  &quot;I am bound to go on with the&#10;mail-bags, so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with&#10;your load.  I'll send somebody to help you as soon as I can.  It is&#10;getting daylight, and you have nothing to fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;He mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited.

At&#10;length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the&#10;driver of the mail-car had been as good as his word.  A farmer's&#10;man from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob.  He was&#10;harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the&#10;load taken on towards Casterbridge.&#10;&#10;The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the&#10;spot of the accident.  Prince had lain there in the ditch since the&#10;morning; but the place of the blood-pool was still visible in the&#10;middle of the road, though scratched and scraped over by passing&#10;vehicles.

    <node id="When a traveler moves from calcareous downs and corn-lands to the base of an escarpment characterized by the bold chalk ridge of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down, they experience several contrasts in landscape and atmosphere. &#10;&#10;Firstly, the traveler encounters a stark difference in the openness of the hills. Behind them, the hills are open with large fields and white lanes, giving an unenclosed character to the landscape.

However, she also deplores the necessity of Tess's visit to her wayward father at the inn, as this errand takes her daughter away from home and family responsibilities.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Compleat Fortune-Teller&quot; is a worn-out volume, indicating that Mrs. Durbeyfield has used it frequently, likely for guidance or reassurance during challenging times.

In contrast to the stranger who easily dismissed the incident from his mind, Tess found it difficult to forget the incident because she was more affected by it.

Additionally, she felt a strong connection with him because he spoke to her so nicely and she enjoyed his company.

    <node id="Τess's father, John Durbeyfield, had recently found out about his family's past noble status, which had been discovered by a wealthy family friend, Parson James Tringham.

In Saint Charles's days, they were made Knights o' the Royal Oak. This newfound status explained John Durbeyfield's strange behavior this afternoon when he rode home in a carriage after making a &quot;mommet&quot; of himself, not because he had been drinking, as people supposed, but due to his pride and excitement about their noble lineage.

The collision resulted in the shaft of the mail-cart piercing through her father's poor horse, Prince, causing his life's blood to spout out in a stream.&#10;2. The lantern hanging at Tess's waggon went out because she had fallen asleep during the trip and did not notice that they had continued to move forward. It is not explicitly stated when or why the lantern went out, but it is mentioned that &quot;the lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out&quot; after Tess was awakened by the strange noises.

    <node id="1. Physical Description: The Vale of Blackmoor is a fertile and sheltered tract of country with arable lands being few and limited. It is characterized by a broad rich mass of grass and trees that mantle minor hills and dales within the major landscape. Its beauty can best be appreciated from the summits of surrounding hills where one can see an enchanting valley view contrasted by open hills in the background. The atmosphere beneath its blue hills is languorous, tinged with azure hues.&#10;&#10;2. Historical Significance: Known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, this region gained historical significance during King Henry III's reign due to a legendary tale involving the king and a white hart. This historic forest was once densely wooded but has now transformed into a broad rich mass of grass and trees, still retaining traces of its earlier condition in surviving oak copses, irregular belts of timber on slopes, and hollow-trunked trees shading many pastures.&#10;&#10;3. Remaining Traces: Even though the forests have largely receded, evidence of its once dense woodland remains visible in the form of old oak copses, irregular belts of timber, and hollow-trunked trees scattered throughout the vale." />
    <node id="The loving relationship between Tess and her mother Joan Durbeyfield is shown through their interaction during the described scene. Joan, despite being burdened with household chores and taking care of her young family, maintains a passion for music and singing. This serves as a reminder that she was once youthful and pretty, implying that Tess has inherited her physical charms from her mother.&#10;&#10;Tess's perception of her personal charms is affected by the realization that her beauty comes from her mother's youthful features. She might feel that her attractiveness is not solely her own but a reflection of her family heritage, which makes it less distinctive or unique in her eyes. This connection between Tess and her mother also highlights the theme of family ties and inheritance present throughout the novel.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Tess's offer to help her mother with the housework demonstrates their mutual support and understanding, even though Joan does not express resentment towards Tess for leaving the chores undone. This display of love and solidarity between mother and daughter strengthens their bond despite the challenging circumstances they face in their poverty-stricken lives." />
    <node id="The Durbeyfield family, originally known as d'Urberville, used to own several seats and estates in this county, including those at Kingsbere, Sherton, Millpond, Lullstead, and Wellbridge. However, they have since lost all their lands and mansions, leaving the current generation without any property or wealth. Parson Tringham suggests that the family should reflect on 'how are the mighty fallen' and accept this historical fact as a point of interest for local historians and genealogists. He advises the family to do nothing about reclaiming their lost properties, as they no longer have any claim to them. The Durbeyfield family is now considered extinct in the county, with their ancestors buried at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill under Purbeck-marble canopies." />

To accommodate drinkers, there is a small ledge or board fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire, allowing thirsty strangers to deposit their cups and drink in the road. Local customers also gather in a large bedroom upstairs, where they can drink more comfortably away from sight behind thick curtains. This unconventional arrangement enables the inn to serve alcohol without breaking licensing laws." />

But there were also local customers who felt the&#10;same wish; and where there's a will there's a way.&#10;&#10;In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly&#10;curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the&#10;landlady, Mrs Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen&#10;persons, all seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer&#10;end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the&#10;distance to the The Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the&#10;further part of the dispersed village, render its accommodation&#10;practically unavailable for dwellers at this end; but the far more&#10;serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent&#10;opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the&#10;housetop than with the other landlord in a wide" />

On reaching the fresh&#10;air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one&#10;moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they&#10;were marching to Bath--which produced a comical effect, frequent&#10;enough in families on nocturnal homegoings; and" />
    <node id="1. Regret and Dismay: As Tess enters her home, she feels regret and dismay due to several reasons. Firstly, she hears rhythmic sounds coming from inside - a series of thumpings caused by the violent rocking of a cradle and a feminine voice singing &quot;The Spotted Cow,&quot; reminding her that her mother is left alone to handle household chores, including the Monday washing-tub that had lingered on to the end of the week. Secondly, Tess realizes that her own white gown, which she carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass during the dance, was washed in that very tub. This realization brings a chill of self-reproach as she wishes she had returned sooner to help her mother instead of indulging herself at the dance.&#10;&#10;2. Comparison with Holiday Festivities: The contrast between Tess's current situation and the holiday festivities she had just been a part of highlights the challenges faced by Tess and her family in their poverty-stricken circumstances. While the dance offered white gowns, nosegays, willow-wands, and whirling movements on the green, symbolizing joy and carefree moments, Tess's homecoming reveals the stark reality of unfinished household chores, an exhausted mother, and a struggling family. This contrast emphasizes the harsh truth of her life outside the dance and the burdens she carries along with her personal charms and beauty." />
    <node id="Prince, the horse who was pulling the wagon of beehives, was struck by the sharp shaft of the morning mail-cart, which pierced through him and caused his life's blood to spout out. The collision occurred because Tess had fallen asleep during the trip, and her unlit wagon was unnoticed by the mail-cart driver. As a result, Prince died from his injuries, and his body was later taken back home by Tess's family. The wagon of beehives was subsequently transported by another horse." />

Tess was not&#10;skilful in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could&#10;take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and&#10;allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so.  She made him a&#10;sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could&#10;not fall, and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as&#10;before.&#10;&#10;Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous&#10;movements of any sort.  With no longer a companion to distract her,&#10;Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning&#10;against the hives.

Abraham and 'Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and&#10;Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the&#10;walls; and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave.&#10;The bread-winner had been taken away from them; what would they do?&#10;&#10;&quot;Is he gone to heaven?&quot; asked Abraham, between the sobs.&#10;&#10;Then Durbey" />

The &quot;strange noises&quot; that awakened Tess from her sleep were a hollow groan and a shout of &quot;Hoi there!&quot; These noises were caused by the fact that the morning mail-cart, which had wheels that were much noiseless than those of Tess's wagon, had collided with her unlighted wagon. The collision resulted in the shaft of the mail-cart piercing through her father's poor horse, Prince, causing his life's blood to spout out in a stream.&#10;2. Tess found herself and the wagon much further along than when she fell asleep because she had fallen asleep during the trip and did not notice that they had continued to move forward. The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, possibly due to a lack of attention or care, leaving her unaware of their progress.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess was awoken from her sleep by the noises of a collision between the mail-cart and her own wagon, which had moved further along than she realized due to her falling asleep and the extinguishing of her lantern. The collision resulted in the death of her father's horse, Prince." />

Behind them, the hills are open with large fields and white lanes, giving an unenclosed character to the landscape. However, upon reaching the base of the escarpment, the world seems to be constructed on a smaller and more delicate scale. The fields become mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear as a network of dark green threads over the paler green of the grass.&#10;&#10;Secondly, there is a noticeable change in the atmosphere. While moving northward, the traveler experiences sunny and colorless atmospheric conditions, but upon reaching the base of the escarpment, the atmosphere becomes languorous, tinged with azure, creating an almost dreamlike middle distance partaking in the same hue while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine.&#10;&#10;Lastly, there is a shift in the vegetation and topography. The hills previously were arable lands with few trees, but as the traveler reaches the base of the escarpment, the landscape becomes a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major. This transformation showcases the region's historic past as the Forest of White Hart.&#10;&#10;These contrasting landscapes and atmospheres evoke a sense of wonder in the traveler, making them appreciate the beauty of the Vale of Blakemore or Blackmoor, which is best viewed from the summits of the hills that surround it.">

Physical Description: The Vale of Blackmoor is a fertile and sheltered tract of country with arable lands being few and limited. It is characterized by a broad rich mass of grass and trees that mantle minor hills and dales within the major landscape. Its beauty can best be appreciated from the summits of surrounding hills where one can see an enchanting valley view contrasted by open hills in the background. The atmosphere beneath its blue hills is languorous, tinged with azure hues.&#10;&#10;2. Historical Significance: Known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, this region gained historical significance during King Henry III's reign due to a legendary tale involving the king and a white hart. This historic forest was once densely wooded but has now transformed into a broad rich mass of grass and trees, still retaining traces of its earlier condition in surviving oak copses, irregular belts of timber on slopes, and hollow-trunked trees shading many pastures.&#10;&#10;3. Remaining Traces: Even though the forests have largely receded, evidence of its once dense woodland remains visible in the form of old oak copses, irregular belts of timber, and hollow-trunked trees scattered throughout the vale.">

The family's real name was d'Urberville, and they were traced back to the days of the Pagan Turks, with monuments, vaults, crests, and 'scutcheons. In Saint Charles's days, they were made Knights o' the Royal Oak. This newfound status explained John Durbeyfield's strange behavior this afternoon when he rode home in a carriage after making a &quot;mommet&quot; of himself, not because he had been drinking, as people supposed, but due to his pride and excitement about their noble lineage. The family now had a claim to being the greatest gentlefolk in the whole county, which was expected to bring them some good; however, it is unclear how this information will affect their financial situation or social standing in the community.">

Regret and Dismay: As Tess enters her home, she feels regret and dismay due to several reasons. Firstly, she hears rhythmic sounds coming from inside - a series of thumpings caused by the violent rocking of a cradle and a feminine voice singing &quot;The Spotted Cow,&quot; reminding her that her mother is left alone to handle household chores, including the Monday washing-tub that had lingered on to the end of the week. Secondly, Tess realizes that her own white gown, which she carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass during the dance, was washed in that very tub. This realization brings a chill of self-reproach as she wishes she had returned sooner to help her mother instead of indulging herself at the dance.&#10;&#10;2. Comparison with Holiday Festivities: The contrast between Tess's current situation and the holiday festivities she had just been a part of highlights the challenges faced by Tess and her family in their poverty-stricken circumstances. While the dance offered white gowns, nosegays, willow-wands, and whirling movements on the green, symbolizing joy and carefree moments, Tess's homecoming reveals the stark reality of unfinished household chores, an exhausted mother, and a struggling family. This contrast emphasizes the harsh truth of her life outside the dance and the burdens she carries along with her personal charms and beauty.">

Firstly, she hears rhythmic sounds coming from inside - a series of thumpings caused by the violent rocking of a cradle and a feminine voice singing &quot;The Spotted Cow,&quot; reminding her that her mother is left alone to handle household chores, including the Monday washing-tub that had lingered on to the end of the week.

This realization brings a chill of self-reproach as she wishes she had returned sooner to help her mother instead of indulging herself at the dance.&#10;&#10;2. Comparison with Holiday Festivities: The contrast between Tess's current situation and the holiday festivities she had just been a part of highlights the challenges faced by Tess and her family in their poverty-stricken circumstances. While the dance offered white gowns, nosegays, willow-wands, and whirling movements on the green, symbolizing joy and carefree moments, Tess's homecoming reveals the stark reality of unfinished household chores, an exhausted mother, and a struggling family. This contrast emphasizes the harsh truth of her life outside the dance and the burdens she carries along with her personal charms and beauty.">

Behind them, the hills are open with large fields and white lanes, giving an unenclosed character to the landscape. However, upon reaching the base of the escarpment, the world seems to be constructed on a smaller and more delicate scale. The fields become mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear as a network of dark green threads over the paler green of the grass.&#10;&#10;Secondly, there is a noticeable change in the atmosphere. While moving northward, the traveler experiences sunny and colorless atmospheric conditions, but upon reaching the base of the escarpment, the atmosphere becomes languorous, tinged with azure, creating an almost dreamlike middle distance partaking in the same hue while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine.&#10;&#10;Lastly, there is a shift in the vegetation and topography. The hills previously were arable lands with few trees, but as the traveler reaches the base of the escarpment, the landscape becomes a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major. This transformation showcases the region's historic past as the Forest of White Hart.&#10;&#10;These contrasting landscapes and atmospheres evoke a sense of wonder in the traveler, making them appreciate the beauty of the Vale of Blakemore or Blackmoor, which is best viewed from the summits of the hills that surround it.">

This connection between Tess and her mother also highlights the theme of family ties and inheritance present throughout the novel.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Tess's offer to help her mother with the housework demonstrates their mutual support and understanding, even though Joan does not express resentment towards Tess for leaving the chores undone. This display of love and solidarity between mother and daughter strengthens their bond despite the challenging circumstances they face in their poverty-stricken lives.">

Physical Description: The Vale of Blackmoor is a fertile and sheltered tract of country with arable lands being few and limited.

Its beauty can best be appreciated from the summits of surrounding hills where one can see an enchanting valley view contrasted by open hills in the background. The atmosphere beneath its blue hills is languorous, tinged with azure hues.&#10;&#10;2. Historical Significance: Known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, this region gained historical significance during King Henry III's reign due to a legendary tale involving the king and a white hart. This historic forest was once densely wooded but has now transformed into a broad rich mass of grass and trees, still retaining traces of its earlier condition in surviving oak copses, irregular belts of timber on slopes, and hollow-trunked trees shading many pastures.&#10;&#10;3. Remaining Traces: Even though the forests have largely receded, evidence of its once dense woodland remains visible in the form of old oak copses, irregular belts of timber, and hollow-trunked trees scattered throughout the vale.">

Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn't thy father&#10;riding hwome in a carriage!&quot;&#10;&#10;A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation.&#10;She was a fine and handsome girl--not handsomer than some others,&#10;possibly--but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added&#10;eloquence to colour and shape.  She wore a red ribbon in her hair,&#10;and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such&#10;a pronounced adornment.  As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen&#10;moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven&#10;by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above&#10;her elbows.  This was the cheerful servant of that establishment,&#10;who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times.&#10;Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was&#10;waving his hand above">

    <edge source="The banded group of women in white gowns consists of young girls and a few older women, participating in the local Cerealia's annual processional march. This tradition has been carried on for centuries, initially starting as a benefit-club or votive sisterhood. The dress code is a nod to Old Style days when cheerfulness and May-time were considered synonymous.&#10;&#10;These women are unique in their own ways – while some have garments that approach pure whitening, others showcase different shades such as bluish pallor or a cadaverous tint on the older characters' gowns. These variations could be due to age, usage, and dye quality.&#10;&#10;Besides their white attire, each member carries her individuality through personal distinctions – unique hairstyles, flowers, or ribbons (like Tess Durbeyfield's red ribbon). They also vary in terms of physical attributes; not all have perfect features but possess charming elements that make them attractive and distinctive.&#10;&#10;Beyond their appearance, each woman nurtures inner qualities – dreams, affections, hobbies, or remote hopes that contribute to their cheerfulness and sometimes even merriment during the procession.

Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful&#10;nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all.  A&#10;difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public&#10;scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate&#10;self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and&#10;showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many&#10;eyes.&#10;&#10;And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each&#10;had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some&#10;affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,&#10;though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.&#10;They were all cheerful, and many of them merry.&#10;&#10;They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the&#10;high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of&#10;the women said--&#10;">

    <edge source="The group consists of Jack Durbeyfield and his sons, traveling together at night with a lantern to light their way. They hang the lantern on the side of their load and walk beside their horse during uphill parts to avoid overloading it. To make the journey more pleasant, they create an &quot;artificial morning&quot; by using the lantern's light, eating bread and butter, and conversing amongst themselves.&#10;&#10;As they pass through the town of Stourcastle, they reach higher ground and approach Bulbarrow or Bealbarrow, one of the highest elevations in South Wessex. The landscape changes as they move further along, with purplish-red &quot;marble canopies&quot; appearing against the sky.&#10;&#10;During their journey, they discuss the history of their family, which once owned numerous estates and manor houses in the county, including seats at Kingsbere, Sherton, Millpond, Lullstead, and Wellbridge. However, they no longer possess any lands or property, as they have all been lost over time.&#10;&#10;The group's journey through the countryside at night is characterized by their use of a lantern to light their way and their observations of the changing landscape as they move past Stourcastle and toward Bulbarrow or Bealbarrow.

Come along, or it&#10;will be dark before we get to Stourcastle, and there's no place we&#10;can sleep at nearer than that; besides, we must get through another&#10;chapter of _A Counterblast to Agnosticism_ before we turn in, now I&#10;have taken the trouble to bring the book.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;All right--I'll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes; don't&#10;stop; I give my word that I will, Felix.&quot;&#10;&#10;The two elder reluctantly left him and walked on, taking their&#10;brother's knapsack to relieve him in following, and the youngest&#10;entered the field.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a thousand pities,&quot; he said gallantly, to two or three of&#10;the girls nearest him, as soon as there was a pause in the dance.&#10;&quot;Where are your partners, my dears?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;">

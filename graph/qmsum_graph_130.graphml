    <node id="1. The issue at hand is how to communicate effectively to parents, guardians, and the general public that the new Welsh law prohibiting physical punishment of children is not meant to criminalize parents. The task of carrying out this communication involves clarifying the intent of the legislation while also addressing concerns about potential over-criminalization.&#10;2. Sally Jenkins, the representative from Children in Wales, mentioned that making it clear on the face of the Bill that the legislation is not intended to criminalize parents could be helpful. This would provide legal backing for the statement and ensure that it is given proper attention.&#10;3. Huw David, representing the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), suggested that the Welsh Government should lead the awareness-raising campaign, as they have already committed to doing so. The WLGA believes this effort will be successful because of the government's commitment and the inherent interest in raising awareness effectively.&#10;4. It is crucial for the messaging to emphasize that the law aims to protect children from harm and promote positive parenting techniques, rather than punishing or stigmatizing parents. This could involve creating informational materials, hosting community events, and utilizing various communication channels to reach different audiences.&#10;5. Collaboration between government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities would be essential for a successful awareness campaign. By working together, these groups can leverage their resources and expertise to create targeted messaging that resonates with diverse communities in Wales." />

They've become a very highly trained workforce, they're ACE aware, they're trauma aware, and anything that focuses, even increases, their professionalism and understanding around a particular point, and also—. So it's a positive unintended consequence, shall we say, that it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've got some specific questions now on implementation for social services, from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. If this Bill becomes law, would you encourage members of the public to contact social services departments if they do see a child being smacked?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: We already encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police, depending on the circumstances.

The committee has already heard different views about whether there's clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children. What evidence does the work of social services provide about whether physical punishment is actually harmful?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: Obviously, what you'll all be aware of is that, as part of the consultation for this Bill, the Public Policy Institute did a further piece of research to look at the impact of physical punishment on children. A number of things that we know—we know from across the world that the evidence is that introducing legislation or changing legislation in this way improves children's positions within their families. What we know is that children themselves, as Alastair has already referred to, really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful, and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience. Now, there may be disagreement about that, there will be different views on that, but that's the voice of the child in this debate. The voice of the child is very clear that physical punishment is for them harmful. I think what we would also" />

Some of the NFAs—the ones that don't get referred at threshold—it will come back to school for, possibly, some support from the family or a team around the family or some other aspect. So, I don't think—. The trust in the professionals—it's actually more important that we are seen to be upholding our duties under the all-Wales safeguarding procedures. That's what engenders trust in a professional workforce.&#10;Speaker: Jayne Bryant AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. We're going to move on now to some questions about the importance of awareness raising from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Good morning. In looking at your written evidence, you say that we must make it very clear to parents, guardians and the public that this legislation is not trying to criminalise parents, and that is clearly very important for you. How do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: I think that's" />
    <node id=" was a duty in that Act for Ministers to promote transplantation. Surely, that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the Bill. Do you have an opinion on that?&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Well, Welsh Government have given that commitment, and I know the Welsh Government honour every commitment that they make—[Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: That's why I'm asking.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: I don't know whether that is necessary—I'm not a legislator. I think that there's obviously an inherent interest in Welsh Government raising awareness, because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful, otherwise we will have parents who feel that they're being criminalised, and that's the last thing we want. I think it's worthy of consideration, but, as I say, I'm not a legislator or a lawyer, so I don't know what implications that will have long term. But to be fair to Welsh Government, I think that commitment is one that I'm sure will be honoured, because Welsh Government will want to make a success of this Bill if it does receive Royal Assent.&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Okay, I understand that. Have you been given an indication of how long you've got between Royal Assent and implementation, and whether you've thought through any of the key milestones that need to be implemented?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: There's a group proposed that would be a strategic leadership group in the steering group that we're part of, which is now laying out what would happen after Royal Assent if that is given. So, we will work towards that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. My final question, Chair, is about some of the responses we've had to this committee that say that the state should not get involved in family life—I'm sure you've heard those views—unless it's in the most serious circumstances. To what extent do you think that this Bill undermines the existing local authority responsibilities, or don't you?&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: The state's paramount role is to protect children from harm. That is our legal responsibility, it's our moral responsibility, and we will discharge that. And there is obviously a view—it's a view that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child—that physical punishment, physical harm" />
    <node id=" And there is obviously a view—it's a view that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child—that physical punishment, physical harm to a child is harm to a child, and we should be preventing that and act to prevent that. That would be the position of the Welsh Local Government Association, and we also respect the mandate that Members of the National Assembly for Wales have too. And we believe that children can be raised by parents without recourse to physical punishment, effectively, and we'd support parents in that. We do not believe that in the 50 nations across the world where such legislation exists that the state is interfering in family life unnecessarily. We believe this action reflects a cultural change, a sea change that's taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years, where the vast majority of parents now say that they do not use it themselves, they do not support it, and we believe this is actually a reflection of what has happened in Welsh society. We support Assembly Members in the view that the natural progression of that is that children's rights are protected across Wales.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, I've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the Bill and its intentions, and so on.

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, if the proposed Bill becomes law, it is likely that members of the public may be encouraged to report instances of child smacking to social services departments. According to Sally Jenkins, the current policy is to encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police in cases where they observe incidents that concern them. While she does not explicitly mention the proposed Bill, it can be inferred that this would also apply in cases where the Bill becomes law. However, there is no indication that reporting such instances would be mandatory for members of the public. It's important to note that the primary aim of the Bill is to improve children's positions within their families and shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment. The focus is on support programs available to parents and discouraging long-term involvement from social services in family matters, except in cases where allegations are made, and there would be a proportionate response as with any other law-breaking behavior." />
    <node id=" to contact social services or the police, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, I'm picking—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: What, if a child is being smacked now?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: Yes. If a child is being smacked now, we would ask that people contact. We have a duty to report, as professionals. But if you were walking out, and you saw something happening to a child, in the same way as if you saw something to an adult.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Right.&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: So, I think that the challenge is about—we've all probably, sadly, witnessed incidents in the doctor's reception, or in a supermarket, and we've failed to do something about it. And I think we then walk away and feel pretty guilty about that, realistically, when you see something happening to a child in a particular circumstance. I think we can't ignore the fact that a child is being assaulted in those circumstances.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that 'If the law" />
    <node id=" bringing up their children. That is why we're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents. And to be clear, there is no way that we want long-term involvement in any child's life, but particularly not in the lives of children who have been smacked by their parents. That is not going to be the result of this legislation, trust me, because we don't want to be involved in—we haven't got the resources to be involved in children's lives. The social worker or the police officer—if they become involved, then there would be a proportionate response to that, and there'll also be a test about whether or not that is progressed. So, if there is an allegation—if this legislation is passed—then that will be looked into and a consideration will be made about whether any action will be taken, and as with any allegation of the law being broken, there would be a proportionate response, as there is now.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And the next question does relate to the practical response to that. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes. Can you outline the practical ways in which social services' interaction" />
    <node id=" Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that 'If the law is changed, the consequences for parents will be considerable.' It also says, 'Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child—under the new definition—' so, I suppose you could argue, a minor tap— 'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma.' To what extent is this accurate, and, also, will thresholds for social services intervention change if the Bill is enacted?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: There are a number of parts to that. Firstly, in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family's life, I think, for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently, even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse. What we do is we go in for short periods in families' lives, to support them to work with their strengths, to work with them and their family members. It's not about us going into families, whatever some of the public perception may be. Our aim is to get in and get out. So, in terms of" />

It says there is also potential to create extra demand on out-of-hours social services teams due to the time that the offences were reported, and in order to support safeguarding measures. Have you assessed how this Bill will impact on emergency and out-of-hours local authority services?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: We have considered that, and again I think that's something that we would very much want to look at as part of implementation. We have out-of-hours provision, we have emergency duty teams already across Wales that operate 24/7. There's no doubt that they exist and they work very closely with our police colleagues.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Are they overstretched at the moment?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: I think in the same way as all of social services is. If we were offered additional resource, we are going to take that. But are they working in a way that protects children day in, day out, and vulnerable adults? Yes, they are, and they will continue to do so.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. We've" />
    <node id="1. Responsibility of professional educational staff: Professional educational staff have a responsibility to make referrals if they believe that a child might be experiencing significant harm or neglect. This duty is based on the understanding that these professionals work closely with children and are therefore in a position to identify potential concerns. The decision to make a referral should be made carefully, considering all available evidence and legal requirements.&#10;&#10;2. The process of making referrals: When educational professionals have concerns about possible significant harm or neglect, they first gather all relevant information related to the situation. This may include general worries about neglect and other areas that, when combined, might suggest significant neglect or harm to the child. Once enough evidence has been collected, a referral is made to the Child Care Assessment Team or the police. The decision on whether the threshold for intervention has been met is made by these professionals, who have multi-agency awareness and expertise in assessing such situations.&#10;&#10;3. Training and clarity: To ensure that educational professionals are clear about their responsibilities and confident in implementing this process, training and awareness raising are crucial. The 'Keeping learners safe' guideline for education professionals emphasizes the duty to report safeguarding concerns. Any additional training needs will be incorporated into the revised version of this document, which is currently being rewritten.&#10;&#10;4. Working with families: Most referrals are made with parental consent, and social care colleagues often engage in conversations with parents to address any issues. From a services perspective, it's essential to have continued collaboration and support for families, signposting them to preventative services and positive parenting approaches.&#10;&#10;5. Trust and relationships: While there is a risk that increased referrals might cause potential harm to relationships and create mistrust, the primary focus should be on the child's wellbeing. The goal is to ensure that professionals are aware of their responsibilities and feel confident in making necessary referrals when significant harm or neglect is suspected. Building trust with parents remains an essential aspect of this process, as professionals work daily to engage and support families." />
    <node id="'s a responsibility on the professional to make that referral and for that universal service. So, the more specialist safeguarding leads within the schools, who have become highly skilled professionals in terms of understanding what might be significant harm—because that's what we're talking about—they understand the legalities when a referral needs to be made. There's always the collation of safeguarding information, where there might be just general concerns about neglect and other areas, which combined would create a picture that there might be significant neglect or significant harm to the child, and then that referral would be made to the child care assessment team or the police. So, that awareness—it needs to be clear for educational professionals that that duty to report is always there. If they believe that that significant harm has happened then that report then goes to the child care assessment team. They will make the judgment on the threshold because they are the professionals. They have the multi-agency awareness of how that meets the threshold. But in terms of education, it'll be that awareness, making sure that there's clarity. If there's anything that professionals need to be trained additionally on, it'll need to go into 'Keeping learners safe', which at the moment is being rewritten. So, there would have to be some" />
    <node id=" That is already happening in schools and is effective, and is shown to be effective, and has an evidence base—we'd always support that that would continue to be invested in. So, that's really my answer.&#10;Speaker: Jayne Bryant AM&#10;Content: Okay. And you were saying about how important trust is as well, but do you think that there's a risk that those in education settings will have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which some have said could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust?&#10;Speaker: Alastair Birch&#10;Content: I don't think it's a matter of mistrust—it's a matter of, you know, if a professional believes, based on the evidence that they have, because they're working with that child every day, that there is significant harm to that child, they are under a duty to report that to social care. So, part of the work is with families, and most of the referrals we make are with parental consent. That consent is a key element of this, and conversation with our social care colleagues is usually, 'You need to speak to the parents again and have a conversation with them.' Some of the NFAs—the ones that don't get referred at" />
    <node id=" Yes, they are, and they will continue to do so.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. We've got some specific questions now on the impact on education from Jayne Bryant.&#10;Speaker: Jayne Bryant AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. Alastair, you've already mentioned about awareness raising and training, which will be key with educational professionals. How confident are you that teachers and others working in those educational settings will be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill, if enacted?&#10;Speaker: Alastair Birch&#10;Content: Training requirements for all professionals in education settings are clear. The universal tier 1 training is there, and all local authorities in Wales will implement that. In that level of general safeguarding awareness and training, the infinite emphasis is on the duty to report. That will remain the same. The thresholds for social care, that's their responsibility. That duty to report will always be there. It says in 'Keeping learners safe', which is the bible in terms of education professionals, that there's a responsibility on the professional to make that referral and for that universal service.

We still have that duty to report whenever there is any safeguarding concern. That'll still be part of the all-Wales child protection procedures. That won't change, and that duty is always going to be there for all our professionals. But that awareness raising and training will be the key, and then, obviously, working in co-operation with our colleagues.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay, I understand that.

    <node id=" services perspective, goes back over two years, directly in working towards this point, never mind the history in terms of work towards this area. But, very directly in relation to this Bill, we were first involved at least two years ago, to recollect, and that was in a series of workshops with other agencies, for example Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the police, and looking in real depth at what the implications would be for us as agencies to look at what the likely trajectory would be in terms of our pathways for referral into our services and what that might mean for us. And then particularly, for example, with CAFCASS Cymru in relation to private law, what the fallout might be, and then what, if anything—and that's the discussion that we need to have—that could mean for children's services in particular, given the pressures that we're already under. So, we've been in constant, I suppose, involvement in terms of the Bill already, as part of the consultation, in terms of the focus groups and in terms of direct work with Welsh Government officials to take this forward. And we are absolutely committed to continuing with that work.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay." />

So, there would have to be some new possible information there relating to this. But as long as there's clarity, and once that implementation phase and the discussion has happened, as long as it's clear for professionals that the duty is always there and they feel a significant harm, then that report will always be there and will always need to be made. It's making sure—and I'll echo what my colleague said, Huw—that the services are key for families. Schools are absolutely fundamental in that support for the families. They have those relationships with the families. I know there was discussion around professional trust. On a daily basis, professionals are working on that trust with parents, because they are the ones that can engage with those families. The family support officers that are working on the ground with highly complex families, with multiple leads and supporting the children—they are fundamental, and investment in that level of support would also help our colleagues as well. So, anything that's preventative. That is already happening in schools and is effective, and is shown to be effective, and has an evidence base—we'd always support that that would continue to" />
    <node id="1. Local authorities have been heavily involved in discussing and exploring the implications of the Bill. They will continue to be involved in the implementation phase, with a focus on awareness raising, early support, and prevention services for families.&#10;2. There is a commitment from the Welsh Government to full involvement of all relevant parties in the implementation process. This includes a major awareness-raising campaign to ensure that families, carers, and parents understand the changes and are on board with the new culture and value system for children.&#10;3. Support services for early intervention and prevention will be available to parents and carers who may struggle with parenting. These services are intended to be a universal offer across Wales, ensuring that every parent has access to this support.&#10;4. The implementation of the Bill should ideally be done carefully and with the right resources to avoid any unintended consequences. Social services departments, particularly children's social services, are currently overstretched and dealing with high numbers of child harm and neglect cases. It is crucial that resources are made available to support these departments in implementing the new legislation while continuing their work with high-needs children and families.&#10;5. In education settings, the main changes would be around training and awareness to ensure that safeguarding leads within schools have the right training and support. Preventative services for parents will also be emphasized, with schools playing a role in signposting and potentially hosting such programs.&#10;6. Social services will continue to work closely with local authorities, families, carers, and parents throughout the implementation process, ensuring that all parties are informed and involved in the changes." />

This is not an imposition. This is embracing a culture and a value system for our children.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.

Do you foresee any unintended consequences for this Bill?&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: If we implement it carefully, if we implement it with the right resources, then I hope not. I think not. But as with every piece of legislation, it is about the implementation, it is about the cultural change as well, and that's why I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available, because our social services departments—children's social services in particular—are overstretched. They are at breaking point—make no bones about it—and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect. We are having record numbers of contacts from police, from teachers, from doctors and, of course, from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect. And obviously, we want to focus our energy and our attention on those children. Equally, though, we don't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in" />

What we don't want to do is further confuse the position. We know that the legislation in different countries has done that, and there are ways that you can do it, but what we would welcome is an opportunity during the implementation phase for discussion.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay.

Item 2, then, this morning, is our sixth scrutiny session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome our witnesses this morning: Sally Jenkins, who is chair of All Wales Heads of Children’s Services and is here representing the Association of Directors of Social Services; Alastair Birch, who is senior system leader for equalities and safeguarding at Pembrokeshire County Council, who is here representing the Association of Directors of Education Wales; and Councillor Huw David, who is the Welsh Local Government Association spokesperson for health and social care and leader of Bridgend County Borough Council. So, thank you all for attending this morning. We're very pleased to have you here. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so, if you" />
    <node id=" from that, in a way. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill talks about the unknown costs for different agencies. You mentioned there that you're doing work around trying to identify some of those costs, but wouldn't it be useful if the explanatory memorandum did explain more about any unknown or unidentified costs, partly in order to calm some of those fears around that? Giving a title 'unidentified costs'—is that good enough?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: I think, clearly, that is a challenge, and that is work that we are participating in and are committed to completing with Welsh Government, to look at what those costs are.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And then they can be added into this.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: I think this is where it would be helpful in the committee's deliberations and where our concern would be, because the reality is we're not going to know what the costs are until it's actually implemented, because we haven't implemented this before. And, therefore, I think there needs to be a commitment that, whatever the costs are, those costs are met because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales. And whilst we don't" />
    <node id=" to that. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes. Can you outline the practical ways in which social services' interaction with parents will change as a result of this proposed law and do you envisage that all referrals to the police will be automatically referred to social services for an assessment? Who's going to make those decisions?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: That will be part of the implementation phase about that decision making. Interestingly, the number of referrals that we currently get from the police that we take absolutely no action on is extraordinary. So, we get a very, very large number of—. It will be happening now; sitting in the civic centre in Newport City Council will be a whole host of social workers taking in the public protection notifications from overnight. It's 10 o'clock, so they're assessing them now, as we speak. And an awful lot of those will have no further action from the local authority.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: But will they be investigated?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: No. There will be no action. There are countless referrals made by agencies to local authorities that we take no action on.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch" />
    <node id="DECLARATIONS OF INTEREST FROM MEMBERS:&#10;There were no declarations of interest from Members during the sixth scrutiny session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill.&#10;&#10;WITNESSES PRESENT:&#10;The witnesses present at this scrutiny session include Sally Jenkins, who is representing the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS), Alastair Birch, who is representing the Association of Directors of Education Wales (ADEW), and Councillor Huw David, who is representing the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA).&#10;&#10;Sally Jenkins is there in her capacity as the chair of All Wales Heads of Children’s Services.

    <node id=" process. And there are certain articles—. I know that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article 4, article 12 and article 37 were a focus in terms of making sure that the best interests of the child were put first, that children expressing their views and opinions was a priority. And we know, for safeguarding purposes, that the express opinions of the child and the voice of the child are a fundamental aspect of any safe environment, whether it be a school or college. So, that is—the position is really following that legal position under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Nothing to add at this stage, no?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: I'll just add, on behalf of ADSS and on behalf of children's services and social services more widely, for us, this is not a change in our position, this is not new; this is a position that we, on behalf of the leaders of social services across Wales, have taken over many years, going back 20, 25 years.

    <node id=", thank you all for attending this morning. We're very pleased to have you here. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so, if you're happy, we'll go straight into questions and I'll start just by asking about your general support for the Bill, which is outlined in the evidence. Can you just explain why you think the current law is ineffective or unclear?&#10;Speaker: Alastair Birch&#10;Content: Bore da—bore da, bawb. So, I'm Alastair Birch. The statement, really, from ADEW is that the rights of the child should be educated and achieved, really, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The current legislation has been criticised, obviously, by the UN concerning the defence of reasonable punishment still being within our current legislation. So, we will always—ADEW will always—advocate that the rights of the child be upheld, so that is really the fundamental aspect in terms of the statement from ADEW, and the position of ADEW is that the rights of the child are fundamental in this process. And there are certain articles—. I know that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article" />
    <node id=" thank you. I've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden on the implementation of the Bill.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. So, you've pre-empted me, Huw.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Right. Sorry. I've got good eyesight; I can't see—. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: You've already said, obviously, that you're looking towards working with Welsh Government in terms of its implementation. What's been your role so far in terms of the implementation of the Bill—local authorities generally, now? Have you had a role? Has Welsh Government been involving you in discussions around the introduction of the Bill so far?&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Yes. So, obviously we were consulted—a key consultee—but also our officials have worked very closely with Welsh Government officials to make sure this is implemented successfully, if it is progressed.&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: Our involvement with this, from a social services perspective, goes back over two years, directly in working towards this point, never mind the history in terms of work towards this area. But, very directly" />
    <node id="1. Dawn Bowden AM, along with other agencies such as Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the police, has been involved in workshops for at least two years, discussing the implications of the Bill on their agencies and potential trajectories for referral into their services. They have also had extensive discussions with CAFCASS Cymru regarding the impact on private law cases and any fallout that could affect children's services, taking into account the pressures these services are already facing. Dawn Bowden AM has been committed to working closely with Welsh Government officials throughout this process and intends to continue doing so.&#10;2. Huw David mentioned that local authorities have been consulted as key stakeholders, and their officials have collaborated with Welsh Government officials to ensure the successful implementation of the Bill, should it be passed.&#10;3. Sally Jenkins, representing the Association of Directors of Social Services, has had involvement in this area for over two years and welcomed the clarity that this Bill would bring, not only for children and parents but also for professionals. She recognizes that although this legislation is infrequently used, its implementation will significantly impact how they care for and nurture children in Wales, providing much-needed clarity. Local authorities have conducted some research to understand the potential impact and related costs, and further work is needed during the implementation phase." />
    <node id=" services across Wales, have taken over many years, going back 20, 25 years. I think what we would say is that we really welcome this Bill and we welcome the proposed change for the clarity it would bring—the clarity that it would bring for children, for parents and for professionals. I think what we would recognise is that this is a very little-used piece of legislation, so it's rare, it's not as if this is something that is going to cast great change across the scene for children and families in Wales, but what it will do is represent a change in the reality of how we care and nurture our children. I would echo absolutely what Alastair has said in terms of the rights of the child, but equally, in terms of all of our policies in Wales in terms of promoting well-being for children, this has to be key. So, for us, this is about a natural progression of change in how we care for our children in Wales. For children's services at the very sharp end of this world, for us, it brings a true clarity. This continues with an ambiguity in how we treat our children and how we care for our children, and the shift for us brings that very much needed clarity.&#10;Speaker: Lyn" />
    <node id=" Welsh Government officials to take this forward. And we are absolutely committed to continuing with that work.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. You touched there on the pressures that you're already under, which we fully appreciate, but you also mentioned in answers to Lynne Neagle earlier on that you welcomed the Bill in terms of its clarity. So, are you confident that the Bill can be implemented without any major impact on your capacity to deal with it?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: We've done—. A number of local authorities—my own included, Newport City Council, has done some work to look at what the likely impact would be and then actually to look at what some of that costing would need to be. Further work is needed on that area, and that needs to be carried out during the implementation phase. I think what we've done is we've looked internationally at what the impact has been elsewhere when similar legislation has been introduced to try and gauge, but that's difficult to do in terms of comparable nations and size and also different systems. And obviously our approach in terms of children and pedagogy is very different from some of the nations that have already done this. I wouldn't like to say one way or the" />
    <node id=" of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary, changes in our police service, but also changes in our preventative services, you've got that whole range of elements. And there is going on across the local authorities and Welsh Government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that, and then to ameliorate that. Children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care, but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we're able to protect them, firstly, and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them. So, there is no simple answer unfortunately. I think, in terms of this Bill and unintended consequences, I agree absolutely with everything that Huw has said. My job is around children at that far end, but what this Bill does is it brings clarity. It brings a clarity even for those children at that very far end. It takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay, and I think that's important" />
    <node id="1. Dawn Bowden AM, along with other agencies such as CAFCASS Cymru and the police, has been engaged in discussions about this children-focused legislation for at least two years. They have considered the implications of the Bill on their agencies and potential trajectories for referral into their services. Dawn Bowden AM has committed to working closely with Welsh Government officials throughout this process.&#10;   &#10;2. Local authorities, represented by Huw David, have been consulted as key stakeholders in the legislation. They have collaborated with Welsh Government officials to ensure successful implementation of the Bill, should it be passed.&#10;&#10;3. Sally Jenkins, representing the Association of Directors of Social Services, acknowledges that while this legislation is infrequently used, its implementation will significantly impact how they care for and nurture children in Wales. Local authorities have conducted research to understand the potential impact and related costs. She suggests that successful implementation requires collaboration between various stakeholders, including education, social care, preventative services, Welsh Government, and the National Assembly, with awareness campaigns being crucial.&#10;&#10;4. Hefin David AM points out that costs associated with the legislation would not only come from an increase in referrals but also from training of staff, awareness-raising efforts, and other additional expenses.&#10;&#10;5. Sally Jenkins agrees with this assessment, noting that many of these related costs will be aligned with existing initiatives. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the trajectory of costs and cases during the implementation phase to ensure appropriate resource allocation and decision-making processes for social services and police." />
    <node id=" in terms of children and pedagogy is very different from some of the nations that have already done this. I wouldn't like to say one way or the other, because I think, in terms of that culture shift, it could be a double impact on us in terms of increased referrals because of increased awareness, but it could also be, I suppose, as Huw alludes to, that, if we're looking at ensuring greater awareness of preventative services and support services for parents, actually people coming to the fore and asking us for those services as well. So, at this stage, I think what we would want to say is that we continue to be fully involved in the implementation phase, to look at what the cost implications for that could be, and not just for the local authorities but also the police, CAFCASS Cymru, for third sector organisations involved in preventative services. I don't think any of that should undermine the position in terms of children and their rights within our society. So, a difficult answer, in the sense that—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: No, I understand. What you're saying is that this is a piece of legislation that, in your view, is a good piece of legislation." />
    <node id=" for you. How do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: I think that's really broad. Obviously, colleagues in education, colleagues in social care, colleagues in preventative services, but also Welsh Government and the National Assembly, in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really, really key. If you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run, notably in relation to violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness—I think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness. We also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness. We have existing preventative services, we have all our universal services, we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards. So, there are a number of avenues that we could then explore. In terms of not wishing to criminalise, I think if we look at the numbers, they are very, very small. And I think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or" />
    <node id=" in terms of prosecution, or consideration for prosecution. We know that it's likely, from some of the work that we've already done, that it's not opening floodgates for a sudden sea of referrals to children's services—that's not the way this is going to be, because the numbers are not out there because of the changes that have already happened in Welsh family life and Welsh society. So, I think as part of the implementation phase, we need to have a really clear understanding of the trajectory of those costs and what's likely to happen over the first six months, 12 months in terms of people's awareness and understanding and what is referred and how that's worked. But in terms of a huge number, no, I don't anticipate it being that.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But the costs wouldn't just be directed to the number of referrals and the number of cases raised, it's the cost around that, with training of staff, awareness—all those extra additional costs that always come with legislation. Is it too much? Is it—?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: No. And I agree with that—that there clearly are—but if you think, many of those things will be aligned with" />
    <node id="1. Sally Jenkins does not believe it is essential for specific details to be included in the text of the Bill, instead advocating for discussions on nuancing during the implementation phase. She emphasizes the importance of simplicity and clarity to avoid further confusion.&#10;&#10;2. Huw David supports full involvement of all relevant parties in the implementation process, with a commitment from the Welsh Government to ensure there is an effective awareness-raising campaign and support available for parents and carers. He believes that families should be taken along on this journey and not feel criminalized.&#10;&#10;3. Alastair Birch thinks it would be beneficial for clarity and training purposes to have the requirement for safeguarding leads within schools to have proper training and support included in the Bill. However, he doesn't explicitly express an opinion on whether it should be on the face of the Bill.&#10;&#10;4. Sian Gwenllian AM questions why the Welsh Government is hesitant to include a clear duty for Ministers to raise awareness about the impact of the Bill, as was done with the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013. She believes this would make it clearer for everyone involved.&#10;&#10;5. Huw David acknowledges Sian Gwenllian AM's question and confirms that there is a commitment from the Welsh Government to honor their commitments regarding awareness-raising campaigns and support for families, carers, and parents during the implementation phase. He also mentions it would be worth considering having such a duty included in the Bill but admits he is not a legislator or lawyer." />
    <node id=", they are very, very small. And I think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or isn't likely to happen once or if this Bill ever gets to the point of Royal Assent—they are small numbers who currently use this defence. It is about that wider issue of awareness raising, and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Do you, therefore, believe that this needs to be on the face of the Bill? That is, you don't say this in your evidence. I'd like to know your opinion on that. Scotland is going to be making it a duty for Scottish Ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the Bill. So far, the Welsh Government says that we don't need to do that in Wales. Wouldn't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the Bill, for example as it was with the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013? There was a duty in that Act for Ministers to promote transplantation. Surely, that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the" />
    <node id="1. Determining the threshold for child abuse: The exact threshold for child abuse is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it is mentioned that if there is a suspicion of significant harm or neglect to the child, a referral should be made to the child care assessment team or the police. This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;2. Making parents and vulnerable children aware of the line: While it may not be possible to explicitly define the threshold for everyone, increasing awareness about available support programs and resources can help both parents and vulnerable children. This includes educating professionals in schools to recognize signs of significant harm and make appropriate referrals. For vulnerable children, campaigns should be launched to inform them about resources like Childline, where they can seek help and ask questions about what constitutes acceptable behavior towards them.&#10;3. Preventing criminalization of parents: The speakers emphasize that the aim is not to criminalize parents who are bringing up their children. Instead, support programs should be made available for families facing significant problems, even if they don't meet the threshold for child abuse or neglect intervention. This approach encourages early intervention and prevention efforts while minimizing unnecessary involvement in families' lives." />
    <node id=" it's okay, that they can smack their child and that that's acceptable. They don't know the difference. A young child is not going to know that difference and there is confusion about what is—. And if you asked most parents, and in fact lots of professionals, they would not be able to tell you, and probably most of you wouldn't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes, where's that line.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Well, at the moment, we don't know where that line is. That vulnerable child, at home, being abused by their parents, does not know where that line is. And they should know where that line is because then they can pick up the phone to Childline or they can talk to a professional and ask them where that line is. So, that would be a step forward. I do recognise, though, that what we don't want to do—and the last thing any of us want to do—is criminalise parents who are bringing up their children. That is why we're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents. And to be clear," />
    <node id=" we would take some sort of action.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Even now, before the legislation?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Can you ask a final question? And I'm going to have to appeal for brief answers, because we've got a lot of ground to cover.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Just very quickly, there may be no action from social services, but it doesn’t mean that we don’t offer support. So, the expectation is that support is offered in those circumstances from family support services, for example—&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: Or prevention.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: —or prevention services. So, we would not say, if we were aware, for example, that there was domestic abuse at a home, ‘There’s no role for children’s social services’, because there may be an assessment that that child may not be at immediate risk of harm, but we would obviously recognise that there are causes for concern there and we would offer that support. So, just to be clear about that. And" />
    <node id="1. Potential consequences of the issue discussed: If the Bill becomes law, there could be an increase in referrals to social services due to people reporting suspected cases of child abuse, including instances of smacking. This might lead to further involvement of social services in families' lives and potential mistrust between parents and educational professionals. However, the primary focus should remain on ensuring children's wellbeing and safety.&#10;2. Involving children in discussions: Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways. First, it fosters a culture where children feel heard and valued, empowering them to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Second, engaging in these discussions helps children become more aware of their rights and the support available for those experiencing adverse childhood experiences. Third, it encourages open communication about challenging topics, which can help create a safer and more supportive learning environment. Lastly, providing opportunities for students to discuss and understand adverse childhood experiences can promote empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers." />
    <node id=" clarity even for those children at that very far end. It takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay, and I think that's important to hang on to.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Sorry.&#10;Speaker: Alastair Birch&#10;Content: One unintended consequences is that I think that there will be an increased focus on the UNCRC. And, in terms of children having a discussion around this point, children need to be part of that discussion. It's something that affects them. And a key aspect of education is the voice of the child. It has become significantly—. It's changed completely in the last 10 years, and it is one of the key things in terms of us driving improvements.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Would that be something that you would be looking to do in schools?&#10;Speaker: Alastair Birch&#10;Content: Anything that improves the voice of the child in any educational context is good and it's very powerful for the children. And it improves their educational experiences, encouraging the opportunities for them to discuss the issues, the adverse childhood experiences that they encounter, which are significant, and it's our educational professionals that are facing" />
    <node id="1. Huw David, as a representative of local authorities, has had a consultative role in the implementation discussions of the Bill. He, along with other local authority officials, have worked closely with Welsh Government officials to ensure the successful implementation of the Bill. This includes discussing the implications of the Bill on local authorities and potential trajectories for referral into their services.&#10;2. From a social services perspective, Sally Jenkins from the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) has been involved in this area for over two years. The ADSS has worked directly towards this point and acknowledges the significance of the Bill's implementation in clarifying how they care for and nurture children in Wales. Local authorities have researched the potential impact and related costs, with further work needed during the implementation phase.&#10;3. While Welsh Government has given a commitment to raise awareness about the Bill, Huw David suggests that having this awareness-raising aspect on the face of the Bill might not be necessary. However, he believes it would be helpful for ensuring families do not feel criminalized by the legislation. The costs associated with implementing the Bill will be identified and worked on collaboratively by local authorities and Welsh Government." />
    <node id=", the money has to come from somewhere else.' We have to get the costs, surely.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Yes, and we will work very closely with Welsh Government to try and establish those costs as quickly as possible. There will be some costs that we will be able to identify. So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. Obviously, my view is the more we put into that, the better. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I think that is something where we need to see a commitment to some additional resources. But I don't put an upper limit on that, because I don't think there's an authority in Wales, and I don't think there's a charity, a police service or a health board in Wales" />
    <node id="The various factors that have contributed to the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales and England include increased austerity, which has led to reduced funding for children's services and support programs. Additionally, there has been an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Wales, leading to a better understanding of the impact of factors such as domestic abuse on children and a greater emphasis on their protection. Changes in practice with judiciary colleagues and the police service, as well as changes in preventative services, have also contributed to this rise. These factors, combined with a huge amount of work being done across local authorities and Welsh Government to address and understand the issue, aim to reduce the number of children coming into care while improving outcomes for those who are already in care." />
    <node id=" give you more work to do in those areas.&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: On the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales, which are higher than those in England, and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities, the work of the care crisis review, which was completed last year; the work of Isabelle Trowler, who's the chief social worker in England; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months; and currently the public law working group, under the auspices of the president of the family court, would all indicate that it's multifactorial. So, what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales. What you can't do is identify a single reason. There have been headlines that have said, 'Is it increased austerity?' That is clearly a part of this. Is it in Wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of, for example, domestic abuse? Is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add" />
    <node id=" that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in those programmes, so that children do not end up in that terrible position where we have to, for their safety, take them from their birth families to protect them. And the reality is, in Wales, that we are doing that to more children than we've done for a long time, and the numbers are growing across Wales. And that is only because of the most appalling neglect and abuse, because there is no way that any judge would permit us to act to make a child safe if it was not for that fact, and the facts are there. So, I don't want that focus to be lost, but, of course, we welcome and understand the need to progress this piece of legislation.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: That rise that you talk about here, is that due to more interventions, greater awareness, more incidents? I'm trying to link this to the Bill in terms of whether the Bill is actually going to give you more work to do in those areas.&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: On the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, Alastair Birch expressed confidence that teachers and other educational professionals would be clear about their duty to support the implementation of the Bill. He mentioned that the training requirements for all professionals in education settings are clear, with a universal tier 1 training that emphasizes the duty to report. He also noted that 'Keeping learners safe', which serves as the bible for education professionals, stresses the responsibility on the professional to make referrals and for that universal service.&#10;&#10;However, Alastair Birch also acknowledged the need for clarity in terms of making sure that safeguarding leads within all schools have the right training and support. He mentioned the necessity of working closely with social care colleagues and other services like housing and education to ensure effective implementation.&#10;&#10;Regarding the thresholds for social care and the responsibility to make referrals, Alastair Birch emphasized that if a professional believes there is significant harm to a child, they are under a duty to report it to social care. He acknowledged the importance of maintaining trust while fulfilling this duty, noting that most referrals are made with parental consent and that professionals need to work together to ensure the best outcomes for children and families." />

Potential risks and concerns include:&#10;   a) Increased referrals might cause potential harm to relationships and create mistrust between educators and parents.&#10;   b) There is a risk of criminalizing parents, which could lead to further strain on families already facing significant challenges.&#10;   c) Overstretched social services departments may struggle to handle the increased number of referrals effectively.&#10;&#10;2. Mitigation strategies include:&#10;   a) Ensuring that professionals are aware of their responsibilities and feel confident in making necessary referrals when significant harm or neglect is suspected, while also building trust with parents by working daily to engage and support families.&#10;   b) Providing early intervention and prevention services for families who may struggle with parenting, encouraging a universal offer across Wales so that every parent has access to this support.&#10;   c) Launching campaigns to inform vulnerable children about resources like Childline, where they can seek help and ask questions about what constitutes acceptable behavior towards them.&#10;   d) Making local authorities, social services, and the Welsh Government fully involved in the implementation process with a major awareness-raising campaign to ensure that families, carers, and parents understand the changes and are on board with the new culture and value system for children.&#10;   e) Ensuring that resources are made available to support social services departments in implementing the new legislation while continuing their work with high-needs children and families.&#10;   f) Focusing on training and awareness within education settings to ensure that safeguarding leads have the right training and support, and working closely with social care colleagues and other services like housing and education to ensure effective implementation." />
    <node id="The speaker, Sally Jenkins, believes that the purpose of the increased clarity in training for various professions related to child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed approach is to create a clear message for all professionals working with children. She emphasizes that this is not about leveraging additional money for social services but a commitment to the rights of children in Wales. The training aims to empower educational professionals, who are already highly trained and aware of ACE and trauma, by focusing on and increasing their understanding of particular issues related to adverse childhood experiences.&#10;&#10;Sally Jenkins also mentions that there could be positive unintended consequences, such as reinvigorating discussions around the voice of the child within various contexts. She does not think that this Bill is a way of getting money into social services; instead, it is about reinforcing the commitment to children's rights and promoting their well-being in Wales." />

So, our teachers, our social workers, our health workers, our police officers already get substantial training around child protection, around safeguarding, around adverse childhood experiences and around a trauma-informed approach to children. What this does is it layers a clarity on that. But rather than having a part of that training, which has to deal with this as an aspect—that is no longer there; it is a clear message for all professions.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I fully appreciate that, and in the briefing note you've given us, you've outlined the pressures on social services.

    <node id="1. The transcript suggests that there may not be sufficient resources and services like Families First in local governments to prevent harm and support families, as speakers have expressed concerns about increased pressures on social services and reductions in funding for children's services. It is crucial to invest more in prevention programs, as early intervention can help address issues before they escalate and require more intensive (and costly) interventions.&#10;2. To mitigate these concerns, it is recommended to provide local authorities with the necessary resources to effectively implement new legislation and support social services departments. This includes early intervention and prevention services for families facing significant challenges, as well as awareness-raising campaigns to inform vulnerable children about available resources like Childline.&#10;3. Additionally, training and awareness within education settings should be prioritized to ensure that safeguarding leads have the right support and resources. Schools can also play a role in signposting parents to preventative services and potentially hosting such programs.&#10;4. To ensure successful implementation of new policies and legislation, it is essential to involve local authorities, social services, the Welsh Government, families, carers, and parents in the process. A major awareness-raising campaign can help ensure that all parties understand the changes and are on board with the new culture and value system for children." />

    <node id="1. Increased referrals to children's services: While it is not anticipated that there will be a huge increase in referrals, some rise in reports related to child smacking may still occur due to increased awareness and understanding of the legislation.&#10;&#10;2. Training of staff: Implementing the new law would require training for relevant personnel within local authorities, social services, CAFCASS Cymru, police, and third-party organizations. This includes ensuring that staff understands the implications of the Bill, how it changes their roles and responsibilities, and how to respond appropriately to reports or allegations related to child smacking.&#10;&#10;3. Awareness campaigns: Raising public awareness about the new law is crucial to ensure families do not feel criminalized and understand the reporting mechanisms. This would involve designing and executing awareness campaigns targeting various stakeholders, including parents, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations. These campaigns can incur significant costs related to marketing materials, event organization, and personnel time.&#10;&#10;4. Collaborative work between agencies: Successful implementation of the Bill will require close collaboration between local authorities, Welsh Government, social services, police, CAFCASS Cymru, and third-party organizations involved in preventative services. This may involve additional expenses related to meetings, consultations, and coordination efforts.&#10;&#10;5. Cost trajectory: Understanding the cost implications during the implementation phase is essential for appropriate resource allocation and decision-making processes. This includes monitoring the number of referrals and cases, associated costs, and ensuring that resources are distributed proportionately between agencies involved in implementing the new law.&#10;&#10;6. Related costs aligned with existing initiatives: Many expenses related to staff training and awareness campaigns may be partially offset by aligning them with existing initiatives. However, this would still require significant time and effort to coordinate efforts across various stakeholders.&#10;&#10;7. Ongoing evaluation and assessment: Ensuring that the new law is effectively implemented will require ongoing monitoring and assessment of its impact on children, families, and agencies involved in implementing the legislation. This may involve additional costs related to data collection, analysis, and reporting." />
    <node id="1. If an individual witnesses a child being physically punished after the proposed Bill becomes law, they may be encouraged to report it to social services departments. However, reporting such instances would likely not be mandatory for members of the public. The primary aim of the Bill is to improve children's positions within their families and shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment, focusing on support programs available to parents and discouraging long-term involvement from social services in family matters.&#10;2. When allegations are made, there will be a proportionate response as with any other law-breaking behavior. An increase in referrals to social services due to people reporting suspected cases of child abuse, including instances of smacking, might occur. This could lead to further involvement of social services in families' lives and potential mistrust between parents and educational professionals. However, the primary focus should remain on ensuring children's wellbeing and safety.&#10;3. Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways, fostering a culture where children feel heard and valued while promoting empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.&#10;4. The Welsh Government should lead the awareness-raising campaign to communicate effectively to parents, guardians, and the general public that the new law prohibiting physical punishment of children is not meant to criminalize parents. This effort will involve clarifying the intent of the legislation while addressing concerns about potential over-criminalization and emphasizing that the law aims to protect children from harm and promote positive parenting techniques. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities would be essential for a successful awareness campaign." />
    <node id="1. The reasonable punishment defense can undermine child protection efforts by permitting an arbitrary level of violence against children, which invades their physical integrity. This ambiguity in how children are treated may create a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse.&#10;2. Changing this aspect of the law would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children. It would help clarify cultural perceptions and expectations around caring for and treating children appropriately.&#10;3. There is evidence that changing legislation related to physical punishment improves children's positions within their families, as it encourages positive parenting techniques and discourages harmful practices.&#10;4. The voice of the child is consistent in expressing that physical punishment is harmful and demeaning. Ensuring children feel heard and valued in discussions about their wellbeing and safety can improve educational experiences and promote empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers." />
    <node id="'s the voice of the child in this debate. The voice of the child is very clear that physical punishment is for them harmful. I think what we would also say is that, in the world that we work in, it's part of a continuum, and, whilst this is an element of how children are cared for, what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work. By changing this, it helps that shift to that absolute recognition that our children must be cared for in a way that is physically safe in all dimensions for them.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence, which invades children's physical integrity, making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse, and you did refer to that just now. Is there anything you want to add on that?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: I would echo that. I think there is something in this that is about our culture, about how we see our children. It is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people," />
    <node id="1. Responsibilities of professional educational staff: Professional educational staff have a responsibility to make referrals if they believe that a child might be experiencing significant harm or neglect. This duty is based on their close working relationship with children, which allows them to identify potential concerns. The decision to make a referral should be made carefully, considering all available evidence and legal requirements.&#10;&#10;2. Process of making referrals: When educational professionals have concerns about possible significant harm or neglect, they first gather all relevant information related to the situation. Once enough evidence has been collected, a referral is made to the Child Care Assessment Team or the police. The decision on whether the threshold for intervention has been met is made by these professionals, who have multi-agency awareness and expertise in assessing such situations.&#10;&#10;3. Determining the threshold for action: The exact threshold for child abuse is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it is mentioned that if there is a suspicion of significant harm or neglect to the child, a referral should be made to the child care assessment team or the police. This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;&#10;4. Trust and relationships: While there is a risk that increased referrals might cause potential harm to relationships and create mistrust, the primary focus should be on the child's wellbeing. The goal is to ensure that professionals are aware of their responsibilities and feel confident in making necessary referrals when significant harm or neglect is suspected. Building trust with parents remains an essential aspect of this process, as professionals work daily to engage and support families." />
    <node id="1. The 'reasonable punishment defense' is a legal provision that allows parents or guardians to use a certain degree of force when disciplining their children without facing criminal charges for assault. However, this ambiguity can lead to an arbitrary level of violence against children, which invades their physical integrity and potentially paves the way for more severe physical or sexual abuse.&#10;2. This ambiguity may also create confusion in societal attitudes towards how children should be treated, making it difficult to establish clear expectations around caring for and treating children appropriately.&#10;3. Eliminating this defense would contribute to shifting societal norms by emphasizing the need for physically safe environments for all children. It would help clarify cultural perceptions and promote positive parenting techniques that discourage harmful practices.&#10;4. The voice of the child is consistent in expressing that physical punishment is harmful and demeaning. Ensuring children feel heard and valued in discussions about their wellbeing and safety can improve educational experiences, foster empathy, and develop resilience among their peers." />
    <node id="1. Sian Gwenllian AM strongly believes that including a specific duty for raising awareness about the impact of the Bill on its face would make it clearer and more effective. She points out the precedent set by the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013, where Ministers were required to promote organ donation. Sian Gwenllian AM questions why the Welsh Government is hesitant to include such a duty in this Bill, as she thinks it would provide clarity for local authorities and front-line services on what needs to be done.&#10;2. Although Huw David acknowledges that there is a commitment from the Welsh Government to honor their commitments regarding awareness-raising campaigns and support for families during the implementation phase, he believes that having such a duty included in the Bill would make it clearer for everyone involved. However, he mentions that he is not a legislator or lawyer and therefore cannot comment on its implications.&#10;3. Sally Jenkins from the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) does not think it is essential for this duty to be included in the text of the Bill. Instead, she advocates for discussions on nuancing during the implementation phase. She emphasizes the importance of simplicity and clarity to avoid further confusion.&#10;4. Lynne Neagle AM thanks Sian Gwenllian AM for her question and moves on to discuss other aspects of the meeting." />

    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcript, if the proposed Bill becomes law, there may be an increase in reports of child smacking to social services departments. However, this does not necessarily mean that there will be a corresponding increase in long-term social services intervention in families' lives. In fact, the primary aim of the Bill is to shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment and improve children's positions within their families, with a focus on support programs available to parents.&#10;&#10;Sally Jenkins emphasizes that the current policy is to provide short-term support to families and work with them to address concerns. This approach would likely continue if the Bill becomes law. While there may be a proportionate response from social services or the police in cases where allegations of abuse are made, the aim is not to criminalize parents or subject them to long-term social services involvement for minor instances of physical punishment.&#10;&#10;The Welsh Government has committed to raising awareness about the changes and ensuring that families, carers, and parents understand the new culture and value system for children. Local authorities will work closely with relevant parties during the implementation process, focusing on early support and prevention services for families. Support services for early intervention and prevention will be available to parents and carers who may struggle with parenting, emphasizing a universal offer across Wales.&#10;&#10;It is important that resources are made available to social services departments to avoid any unintended consequences of the Bill's implementation. While there may be an increase in referrals to social services, this does not necessarily mean long-term involvement. The focus remains on short-term support and prevention services, with a commitment to maintaining trust between education settings, families, and social services." />
    <node id="1. When social services professionals in Wales receive a report of domestic abuse involving a child who has been smacked, they would look into it, particularly if there are signs of harm or something clearly wrong. This assessment is carried out irrespective of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014.&#10;2. Before the implementation of this act, social services might not have taken action on some reports involving a child being smacked, especially if the perceived level of harm was below the threshold for intervention. This approach aligns with the historical view that reasonable chastisement is an acceptable form of discipline.&#10;3. With the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014, social services professionals now have a more defined framework to assess reports of domestic abuse or harm to children. While this does not necessarily mean that all reported cases of smacking will result in intervention, it emphasizes a more rigorous assessment process.&#10;4. The increased clarity in training for various professions related to child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and trauma-informed approaches aims to empower educational professionals and create a clear message for all professionals working with children. This commitment focuses on children's rights and well-being rather than leveraging additional money for social services.&#10;5. The primary aim of the proposed Bill is not to criminalize parents but to improve children's positions within their families and shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment. The focus is on support programs available to parents and discouraging long-term involvement from social services in family matters." />

    <node id="1. Over the first six months to a year, costs related to the implementation of the proposed legislation are expected to rise due to increased awareness and understanding of the new law. These costs will not only come from an increase in referrals but also from additional expenses such as training of staff, awareness-raising efforts, and other related costs.&#10;&#10;2. During this period, local authorities, Welsh Government, social services, police, CAFCASS Cymru, and third-party organizations involved in preventative services will collaborate to ensure successful implementation. They will monitor the number of referrals and cases, associated costs, and ensure that resources are distributed proportionately between agencies involved in implementing the new law.&#10;&#10;3. Some of these related costs may be aligned with existing initiatives, helping offset some expenses. However, significant time and effort will still be required to coordinate efforts across various stakeholders.&#10;&#10;4. As Dawn Bowden AM mentioned, there could be a &quot;double impact&quot; on Wales due to the culture shift brought about by the new legislation – an increase in referrals because of increased awareness and more parents seeking support services. This potential dual effect will need to be considered when evaluating the trajectory of costs during implementation.&#10;&#10;5. Over the first six months and 12 months, ongoing monitoring and assessment will help provide a clearer understanding of these costs as agencies work together to ensure families do not feel criminalized and children's rights are upheld within Welsh society." />
    <node id="1. The proposed Bill aims to clarify how local authorities care for and nurture children in Wales, particularly by protecting them from harm as stated by Huw David. This includes discussing the implications of the Bill on local authorities and potential trajectories for referral into their services.&#10;2. The Bill is grounded in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enshrines the view that physical punishment and physical harm to a child are forms of harm. It seeks to prevent such harm by supporting parents in raising children without recourse to physical punishment. This reflects a cultural change that has taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years.&#10;3. The Bill is not intended as a way of getting money into social services, but rather about reinforcing the commitment to children's rights and promoting their well-being in Wales. It aims to create clarity in how professionals working with children approach child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed approaches.&#10;4. The Bill is expected to improve children's positions within their families by changing legislation regarding physical punishment, as research has shown that introducing such legislation across the world improves children's situations in their homes. Children find physical punishment emotionally damaging, and this view is clear among children themselves.&#10;5. The Bill aims to ensure that families come with them on this journey, and it emphasizes the need for support available to parents who struggle with parenting as a universal offer across Wales. Local authorities have been heavily involved in exploring the implications of this Bill from various perspectives, including awareness-raising and early support and intervention services for families.&#10;6. By addressing physical punishment as a form of harm, the Bill affects existing local authority responsibilities by requiring them to promote alternative methods of discipline and parenting support, ultimately contributing to a culture and value system that prioritizes children's well-being in Wales." />
    <node id="1. The transcript suggests that there may not be sufficient resources and services like Families First in local governments to prevent harm and support families. Speakers have expressed concerns about increased pressures on social services due to reduced funding for children's services, as well as a growing awareness of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Wales. These factors have contributed to the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales and England.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, it is essential to provide local authorities with the necessary resources to effectively implement new legislation and support social services departments. This includes early intervention and prevention services for families facing significant challenges, as well as awareness-raising campaigns to inform vulnerable children about available resources like Childline. Training and awareness within education settings should also be prioritized to ensure that safeguarding leads have the right support and resources. Schools can potentially host preventative services or signpost parents to them.&#10;&#10;Involving local authorities, social services, the Welsh Government, families, carers, and parents in the implementation process will help ensure a successful rollout of new policies and legislation. A major awareness-raising campaign can help ensure that all parties understand the changes and are on board with the new culture and value system for children.&#10;&#10;While there may be an increase in reports of child smacking to social services departments if the proposed Bill becomes law, the focus remains on short-term support and prevention services.

However, resources must be made available to social services departments to avoid any unintended consequences of the Bill's implementation." />
    <node id="1. Concerns about neglect or other general worries: If educational professionals notice general concerns about a child's wellbeing, they may gather this information and make a referral to the Child Care Assessment Team. However, upon assessment, it might be determined that there is no significant harm or neglect taking place.&#10;&#10;2. Combined evidence insufficient for intervention: Sometimes, multiple pieces of information regarding a child's situation are collected but do not meet the threshold for significant harm or neglect when considered together. In such cases, these referrals may result in no further action being taken by local authorities.&#10;&#10;Examples provided by Sally Jenkins in the transcript include situations where there is a paper assessment of referrals and a look at what has happened, who is involved, and what the police have reported. These assessments aim to improve the process between police and social services, ensuring that only incidents requiring action are investigated further." />
    <node id=": No. There will be no action. There are countless referrals made by agencies to local authorities that we take no action on.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: So, if there's an increase as a result of greater awareness—&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: What happens is there is a paper assessment of them. There's a look at what's happened, who's involved, what the police have reported, and there's work being done with the police to improve that. Because one of the things that we want to get to is actually where we're not using huge amounts of time to look at that, but what comes to us is what we act on. So, there is work going on with a number of police authorities to look at how you improve that process. But I suppose, to pick up, each incident will be looked at, each one will be assessed in a way that is proportionate, as Huw says, to look at what's happened and then investigated.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Sally, can you give us a couple of examples of what kind of things might have come in that you would then take no action on?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The disagreement between Sally Jenkins and the children's commissioner/equal protection network revolves around the approach to defining what constitutes corporal punishment in the Bill. On one hand, Sally Jenkins emphasizes the need for greater clarity in the definition of corporal punishment, arguing that it would help address ambiguity in how children are treated and potentially prevent more serious physical or sexual abuse. This clarity, she believes, would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children and improve children's positions within their families.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the children's commissioner and the equal protection network argue for simplicity in the Bill, stating that a simpler approach would make the legislation more accessible and easier to understand for the general public. They likely believe that a simpler definition would encourage more people to report instances of corporal punishment, leading to increased protection for children and better enforcement of the law.&#10;&#10;The disagreement lies in finding the right balance between clarity and simplicity to create a Bill that effectively addresses corporal punishment while also being easily understood by the public." />

The final question from me: your written evidence emphasises the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, but that contrasts with what we've been told by the children's commissioner and the equal protection network, who've emphasised the importance of simplicity in the Bill.

    <edge source="1. The issue at hand is how to communicate effectively to parents, guardians, and the general public that the new Welsh law prohibiting physical punishment of children is not meant to criminalize parents. The task of carrying out this communication involves clarifying the intent of the legislation while also addressing concerns about potential over-criminalization.&#10;2. Sally Jenkins, the representative from Children in Wales, mentioned that making it clear on the face of the Bill that the legislation is not intended to criminalize parents could be helpful. This would provide legal backing for the statement and ensure that it is given proper attention.&#10;3. Huw David, representing the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), suggested that the Welsh Government should lead the awareness-raising campaign, as they have already committed to doing so. The WLGA believes this effort will be successful because of the government's commitment and the inherent interest in raising awareness effectively.&#10;4. It is crucial for the messaging to emphasize that the law aims to protect children from harm and promote positive parenting techniques, rather than punishing or stigmatizing parents. This could involve creating informational materials, hosting community events, and utilizing various communication channels to reach different audiences.&#10;5. Collaboration between government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities would be essential for a successful awareness campaign. By working together, these groups can leverage their resources and expertise to create targeted messaging that resonates with diverse communities in Wales." target=", encouraging the opportunities for them to discuss the issues, the adverse childhood experiences that they encounter, which are significant, and it's our educational professionals that are facing this day-in, day-out.

Involving children in discussions: Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways. First, it fosters a culture where children feel heard and valued, empowering them to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Second, engaging in these discussions helps children become more aware of their rights and the support available for those experiencing adverse childhood experiences. Third, it encourages open communication about challenging topics, which can help create a safer and more supportive learning environment. Lastly, providing opportunities for students to discuss and understand adverse childhood experiences can promote empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.">

The disagreement between Sally Jenkins and the children's commissioner/equal protection network revolves around the approach to defining what constitutes corporal punishment in the Bill. On one hand, Sally Jenkins emphasizes the need for greater clarity in the definition of corporal punishment, arguing that it would help address ambiguity in how children are treated and potentially prevent more serious physical or sexual abuse. This clarity, she believes, would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children and improve children's positions within their families.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the children's commissioner and the equal protection network argue for simplicity in the Bill, stating that a simpler approach would make the legislation more accessible and easier to understand for the general public. They likely believe that a simpler definition would encourage more people to report instances of corporal punishment, leading to increased protection for children and better enforcement of the law.&#10;&#10;The disagreement lies in finding the right balance between clarity and simplicity to create a Bill that effectively addresses corporal punishment while also being easily understood by the public.">

This includes ensuring that staff understands the implications of the Bill, how it changes their roles and responsibilities, and how to respond appropriately to reports or allegations related to child smacking.&#10;&#10;3. Awareness campaigns: Raising public awareness about the new law is crucial to ensure families do not feel criminalized and understand the reporting mechanisms.

An increase in referrals to social services due to people reporting suspected cases of child abuse, including instances of smacking, might occur.

Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways, fostering a culture where children feel heard and valued while promoting empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.&#10;4. The Welsh Government should lead the awareness-raising campaign to communicate effectively to parents, guardians, and the general public that the new law prohibiting physical punishment of children is not meant to criminalize parents. This effort will involve clarifying the intent of the legislation while addressing concerns about potential over-criminalization and emphasizing that the law aims to protect children from harm and promote positive parenting techniques.

The disagreement between Sally Jenkins and the children's commissioner/equal protection network revolves around the approach to defining what constitutes corporal punishment in the Bill. On one hand, Sally Jenkins emphasizes the need for greater clarity in the definition of corporal punishment, arguing that it would help address ambiguity in how children are treated and potentially prevent more serious physical or sexual abuse. This clarity, she believes, would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children and improve children's positions within their families.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the children's commissioner and the equal protection network argue for simplicity in the Bill, stating that a simpler approach would make the legislation more accessible and easier to understand for the general public. They likely believe that a simpler definition would encourage more people to report instances of corporal punishment, leading to increased protection for children and better enforcement of the law.&#10;&#10;The disagreement lies in finding the right balance between clarity and simplicity to create a Bill that effectively addresses corporal punishment while also being easily understood by the public.">

This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;2. Making parents and vulnerable children aware of the line: While it may not be possible to explicitly define the threshold for everyone, increasing awareness about available support programs and resources can help both parents and vulnerable children. This includes educating professionals in schools to recognize signs of significant harm and make appropriate referrals. For vulnerable children, campaigns should be launched to inform them about resources like Childline, where they can seek help and ask questions about what constitutes acceptable behavior towards them.&#10;3. Preventing criminalization of parents: The speakers emphasize that the aim is not to criminalize parents who are bringing up their children. Instead, support programs should be made available for families facing significant problems, even if they don't meet the threshold for child abuse or neglect intervention. This approach encourages early intervention and prevention efforts while minimizing unnecessary involvement in families' lives.">

    <edge source=" Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that 'If the law is changed, the consequences for parents will be considerable.' It also says, 'Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child—under the new definition—' so, I suppose you could argue, a minor tap— 'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma.' To what extent is this accurate, and, also, will thresholds for social services intervention change if the Bill is enacted?&#10;Speaker: Sally Jenkins&#10;Content: There are a number of parts to that. Firstly, in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family's life, I think, for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently, even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse. What we do is we go in for short periods in families' lives, to support them to work with their strengths, to work with them and their family members. It's not about us going into families, whatever some of the public perception may be. Our aim is to get in and get out. So, in terms of" target="Based on the information provided in the transcript, if the proposed Bill becomes law, there may be an increase in reports of child smacking to social services departments. However, this does not necessarily mean that there will be a corresponding increase in long-term social services intervention in families' lives. In fact, the primary aim of the Bill is to shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment and improve children's positions within their families, with a focus on support programs available to parents.&#10;&#10;Sally Jenkins emphasizes that the current policy is to provide short-term support to families and work with them to address concerns. This approach would likely continue if the Bill becomes law. While there may be a proportionate response from social services or the police in cases where allegations of abuse are made, the aim is not to criminalize parents or subject them to long-term social services involvement for minor instances of physical punishment.&#10;&#10;The Welsh Government has committed to raising awareness about the changes and ensuring that families, carers, and parents understand the new culture and value system for children. Local authorities will work closely with relevant parties during the implementation process, focusing on early support and prevention services for families. Support services for early intervention and prevention will be available to parents and carers who may struggle with parenting, emphasizing a universal offer across Wales.&#10;&#10;It is important that resources are made available to social services departments to avoid any unintended consequences of the Bill's implementation. While there may be an increase in referrals to social services, this does not necessarily mean long-term involvement. The focus remains on short-term support and prevention services, with a commitment to maintaining trust between education settings, families, and social services.">

The decision to make a referral should be made carefully, considering all available evidence and legal requirements.&#10;&#10;2. The process of making referrals: When educational professionals have concerns about possible significant harm or neglect, they first gather all relevant information related to the situation. This may include general worries about neglect and other areas that, when combined, might suggest significant neglect or harm to the child. Once enough evidence has been collected, a referral is made to the Child Care Assessment Team or the police. The decision on whether the threshold for intervention has been met is made by these professionals, who have multi-agency awareness and expertise in assessing such situations.&#10;&#10;3. Training and clarity: To ensure that educational professionals are clear about their responsibilities and confident in implementing this process, training and awareness raising are crucial. The 'Keeping learners safe' guideline for education professionals emphasizes the duty to report safeguarding concerns. Any additional training needs will be incorporated into the revised version of this document, which is currently being rewritten.&#10;&#10;4. Working with families: Most referrals are made with parental consent, and social care colleagues often engage in conversations with parents to address any issues. From a services perspective, it's essential to have continued collaboration and support for families, signposting them to preventative services and positive parenting approaches.&#10;&#10;5. Trust and relationships: While there is a risk that increased referrals might cause potential harm to relationships and create mistrust, the primary focus should be on the child's wellbeing. The goal is to ensure that professionals are aware of their responsibilities and feel confident in making necessary referrals when significant harm or neglect is suspected. Building trust with parents remains an essential aspect of this process, as professionals work daily to engage and support families." target="1. Concerns about neglect or other general worries: If educational professionals notice general concerns about a child's wellbeing, they may gather this information and make a referral to the Child Care Assessment Team. However, upon assessment, it might be determined that there is no significant harm or neglect taking place.&#10;&#10;2. Combined evidence insufficient for intervention: Sometimes, multiple pieces of information regarding a child's situation are collected but do not meet the threshold for significant harm or neglect when considered together. In such cases, these referrals may result in no further action being taken by local authorities.&#10;&#10;Examples provided by Sally Jenkins in the transcript include situations where there is a paper assessment of referrals and a look at what has happened, who is involved, and what the police have reported. These assessments aim to improve the process between police and social services, ensuring that only incidents requiring action are investigated further.">

Making parents and vulnerable children aware of the line: While it may not be possible to explicitly define the threshold for everyone, increasing awareness about available support programs and resources can help both parents and vulnerable children. This includes educating professionals in schools to recognize signs of significant harm and make appropriate referrals. For vulnerable children, campaigns should be launched to inform them about resources like Childline, where they can seek help and ask questions about what constitutes acceptable behavior towards them.&#10;3. Preventing criminalization of parents: The speakers emphasize that the aim is not to criminalize parents who are bringing up their children. Instead, support programs should be made available for families facing significant problems, even if they don't meet the threshold for child abuse or neglect intervention. This approach encourages early intervention and prevention efforts while minimizing unnecessary involvement in families' lives.">

However, the primary focus should remain on ensuring children's wellbeing and safety.&#10;2. Involving children in discussions: Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways. First, it fosters a culture where children feel heard and valued, empowering them to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Second, engaging in these discussions helps children become more aware of their rights and the support available for those experiencing adverse childhood experiences. Third, it encourages open communication about challenging topics, which can help create a safer and more supportive learning environment. Lastly, providing opportunities for students to discuss and understand adverse childhood experiences can promote empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.">

Once enough evidence has been collected, a referral is made to the Child Care Assessment Team or the police. The decision on whether the threshold for intervention has been met is made by these professionals, who have multi-agency awareness and expertise in assessing such situations.&#10;&#10;3. Determining the threshold for action: The exact threshold for child abuse is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it is mentioned that if there is a suspicion of significant harm or neglect to the child, a referral should be made to the child care assessment team or the police. This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;&#10;4. Trust and relationships: While there is a risk that increased referrals might cause potential harm to relationships and create mistrust, the primary focus should be on the child's wellbeing. The goal is to ensure that professionals are aware of their responsibilities and feel confident in making necessary referrals when significant harm or neglect is suspected. Building trust with parents remains an essential aspect of this process, as professionals work daily to engage and support families.">

The transcript suggests that there may not be sufficient resources and services like Families First in local governments to prevent harm and support families, as speakers have expressed concerns about increased pressures on social services and reductions in funding for children's services. It is crucial to invest more in prevention programs, as early intervention can help address issues before they escalate and require more intensive (and costly) interventions.&#10;2. To mitigate these concerns, it is recommended to provide local authorities with the necessary resources to effectively implement new legislation and support social services departments. This includes early intervention and prevention services for families facing significant challenges, as well as awareness-raising campaigns to inform vulnerable children about available resources like Childline.&#10;3. Additionally, training and awareness within education settings should be prioritized to ensure that safeguarding leads have the right support and resources. Schools can also play a role in signposting parents to preventative services and potentially hosting such programs.&#10;4. To ensure successful implementation of new policies and legislation, it is essential to involve local authorities, social services, the Welsh Government, families, carers, and parents in the process. A major awareness-raising campaign can help ensure that all parties understand the changes and are on board with the new culture and value system for children.">

I've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden on the implementation of the Bill.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank" target="1. The proposed Bill aims to clarify how local authorities care for and nurture children in Wales, particularly by protecting them from harm as stated by Huw David. This includes discussing the implications of the Bill on local authorities and potential trajectories for referral into their services.&#10;2. The Bill is grounded in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enshrines the view that physical punishment and physical harm to a child are forms of harm. It seeks to prevent such harm by supporting parents in raising children without recourse to physical punishment. This reflects a cultural change that has taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years.&#10;3. The Bill is not intended as a way of getting money into social services, but rather about reinforcing the commitment to children's rights and promoting their well-being in Wales. It aims to create clarity in how professionals working with children approach child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed approaches.&#10;4. The Bill is expected to improve children's positions within their families by changing legislation regarding physical punishment, as research has shown that introducing such legislation across the world improves children's situations in their homes. Children find physical punishment emotionally damaging, and this view is clear among children themselves.&#10;5. The Bill aims to ensure that families come with them on this journey, and it emphasizes the need for support available to parents who struggle with parenting as a universal offer across Wales. Local authorities have been heavily involved in exploring the implications of this Bill from various perspectives, including awareness-raising and early support and intervention services for families.&#10;6. By addressing physical punishment as a form of harm, the Bill affects existing local authority responsibilities by requiring them to promote alternative methods of discipline and parenting support, ultimately contributing to a culture and value system that prioritizes children's well-being in Wales.">

    <edge source=": Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, I've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the Bill and its intentions, and so on. Do you foresee any unintended consequences for this Bill?&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: If we implement it carefully, if we implement it with the right resources, then I hope not. I think not. But as with every piece of legislation, it is about the implementation, it is about the cultural change as well, and that's why I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available, because our social services departments—children's social services in particular—are overstretched. They are at breaking point—make no bones about it—and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect. We are having record numbers of contacts from police, from teachers, from doctors and, of course, from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect. And obviously, we want to focus our energy and our attention on those children. Equally, though, we don't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in" target="1. Determining the threshold for child abuse: The exact threshold for child abuse is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it is mentioned that if there is a suspicion of significant harm or neglect to the child, a referral should be made to the child care assessment team or the police. This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;2. Making parents and vulnerable children aware of the line: While it may not be possible to explicitly define the threshold for everyone, increasing awareness about available support programs and resources can help both parents and vulnerable children. This includes educating professionals in schools to recognize signs of significant harm and make appropriate referrals. For vulnerable children, campaigns should be launched to inform them about resources like Childline, where they can seek help and ask questions about what constitutes acceptable behavior towards them.&#10;3. Preventing criminalization of parents: The speakers emphasize that the aim is not to criminalize parents who are bringing up their children. Instead, support programs should be made available for families facing significant problems, even if they don't meet the threshold for child abuse or neglect intervention. This approach encourages early intervention and prevention efforts while minimizing unnecessary involvement in families' lives.">

The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill talks about the unknown costs for different agencies. You mentioned there that you're doing work around trying to identify some of those costs, but wouldn't it be useful if the explanatory memorandum did explain more about any unknown or unidentified costs, partly in order to calm some of those fears around that?

Additionally, there has been an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Wales, leading to a better understanding of the impact of factors such as domestic abuse on children and a greater emphasis on their protection. Changes in practice with judiciary colleagues and the police service, as well as changes in preventative services, have also contributed to this rise. These factors, combined with a huge amount of work being done across local authorities and Welsh Government to address and understand the issue, aim to reduce the number of children coming into care while improving outcomes for those who are already in care.">

The reasonable punishment defense can undermine child protection efforts by permitting an arbitrary level of violence against children, which invades their physical integrity. This ambiguity in how children are treated may create a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse.&#10;2. Changing this aspect of the law would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children. It would help clarify cultural perceptions and expectations around caring for and treating children appropriately.&#10;3. There is evidence that changing legislation related to physical punishment improves children's positions within their families, as it encourages positive parenting techniques and discourages harmful practices.&#10;4. The voice of the child is consistent in expressing that physical punishment is harmful and demeaning. Ensuring children feel heard and valued in discussions about their wellbeing and safety can improve educational experiences and promote empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.">

Increased referrals to children's services: While it is not anticipated that there will be a huge increase in referrals, some rise in reports related to child smacking may still occur due to increased awareness and understanding of the legislation.&#10;&#10;2. Training of staff: Implementing the new law would require training for relevant personnel within local authorities, social services, CAFCASS Cymru, police, and third-party organizations. This includes ensuring that staff understands the implications of the Bill, how it changes their roles and responsibilities, and how to respond appropriately to reports or allegations related to child smacking.&#10;&#10;3. Awareness campaigns: Raising public awareness about the new law is crucial to ensure families do not feel criminalized and understand the reporting mechanisms.

These campaigns can incur significant costs related to marketing materials, event organization, and personnel time.&#10;&#10;4.

Potential consequences of the issue discussed: If the Bill becomes law, there could be an increase in referrals to social services due to people reporting suspected cases of child abuse, including instances of smacking. This might lead to further involvement of social services in families' lives and potential mistrust between parents and educational professionals. However, the primary focus should remain on ensuring children's wellbeing and safety.&#10;2. Involving children in discussions: Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways. First, it fosters a culture where children feel heard and valued, empowering them to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. Second, engaging in these discussions helps children become more aware of their rights and the support available for those experiencing adverse childhood experiences. Third, it encourages open communication about challenging topics, which can help create a safer and more supportive learning environment. Lastly, providing opportunities for students to discuss and understand adverse childhood experiences can promote empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.">

So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. Obviously, my view is the more we put into that, the better. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I think that is something where we need to see a commitment to some additional resources.

Over the first six months to a year, costs related to the implementation of the proposed legislation are expected to rise due to increased awareness and understanding of the new law. These costs will not only come from an increase in referrals but also from additional expenses such as training of staff, awareness-raising efforts, and other related costs.&#10;&#10;2. During this period, local authorities, Welsh Government, social services, police, CAFCASS Cymru, and third-party organizations involved in preventative services will collaborate to ensure successful implementation. They will monitor the number of referrals and cases, associated costs, and ensure that resources are distributed proportionately between agencies involved in implementing the new law.&#10;&#10;3. Some of these related costs may be aligned with existing initiatives, helping offset some expenses. However, significant time and effort will still be required to coordinate efforts across various stakeholders.&#10;&#10;4. As Dawn Bowden AM mentioned, there could be a &quot;double impact&quot; on Wales due to the culture shift brought about by the new legislation – an increase in referrals because of increased awareness and more parents seeking support services. This potential dual effect will need to be considered when evaluating the trajectory of costs during implementation.&#10;&#10;5. Over the first six months and 12 months, ongoing monitoring and assessment will help provide a clearer understanding of these costs as agencies work together to ensure families do not feel criminalized and children's rights are upheld within Welsh society.">

He, along with other local authority officials, have worked closely with Welsh Government officials to ensure the successful implementation of the Bill. This includes discussing the implications of the Bill on local authorities and potential trajectories for referral into their services.&#10;2. From a social services perspective, Sally Jenkins from the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) has been involved in this area for over two years. The ADSS has worked directly towards this point and acknowledges the significance of the Bill's implementation in clarifying how they care for and nurture children in Wales.

The proposed Bill aims to clarify how local authorities care for and nurture children in Wales, particularly by protecting them from harm as stated by Huw David. This includes discussing the implications of the Bill on local authorities and potential trajectories for referral into their services.&#10;2. The Bill is grounded in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enshrines the view that physical punishment and physical harm to a child are forms of harm. It seeks to prevent such harm by supporting parents in raising children without recourse to physical punishment. This reflects a cultural change that has taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years.&#10;3. The Bill is not intended as a way of getting money into social services, but rather about reinforcing the commitment to children's rights and promoting their well-being in Wales. It aims to create clarity in how professionals working with children approach child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed approaches.&#10;4. The Bill is expected to improve children's positions within their families by changing legislation regarding physical punishment, as research has shown that introducing such legislation across the world improves children's situations in their homes. Children find physical punishment emotionally damaging, and this view is clear among children themselves.&#10;5. The Bill aims to ensure that families come with them on this journey, and it emphasizes the need for support available to parents who struggle with parenting as a universal offer across Wales. Local authorities have been heavily involved in exploring the implications of this Bill from various perspectives, including awareness-raising and early support and intervention services for families.&#10;6. By addressing physical punishment as a form of harm, the Bill affects existing local authority responsibilities by requiring them to promote alternative methods of discipline and parenting support, ultimately contributing to a culture and value system that prioritizes children's well-being in Wales.">

We have to get the costs, surely.&#10;Speaker: Huw David&#10;Content: Yes, and we will work very closely with Welsh Government to try and establish those costs as quickly as possible. There will be some costs that we will be able to identify. So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. Obviously, my view is the more we put into that, the better. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I think that is something where we need to see a commitment to some additional resources. But I don't put an upper limit on that, because I don't think there's an authority in Wales, and I don't think there's a charity, a police service or a health board in Wales" target="The various factors that have contributed to the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales and England include increased austerity, which has led to reduced funding for children's services and support programs. Additionally, there has been an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Wales, leading to a better understanding of the impact of factors such as domestic abuse on children and a greater emphasis on their protection. Changes in practice with judiciary colleagues and the police service, as well as changes in preventative services, have also contributed to this rise.

So, what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales. What you can't do is identify a single reason. There have been headlines that have said, 'Is it increased austerity?' That is clearly a part of this. Is it in Wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of, for example, domestic abuse? Is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add">

Responsibilities of professional educational staff: Professional educational staff have a responsibility to make referrals if they believe that a child might be experiencing significant harm or neglect. This duty is based on their close working relationship with children, which allows them to identify potential concerns. The decision to make a referral should be made carefully, considering all available evidence and legal requirements.&#10;&#10;2. Process of making referrals: When educational professionals have concerns about possible significant harm or neglect, they first gather all relevant information related to the situation. Once enough evidence has been collected, a referral is made to the Child Care Assessment Team or the police. The decision on whether the threshold for intervention has been met is made by these professionals, who have multi-agency awareness and expertise in assessing such situations.&#10;&#10;3. Determining the threshold for action: The exact threshold for child abuse is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it is mentioned that if there is a suspicion of significant harm or neglect to the child, a referral should be made to the child care assessment team or the police. This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;&#10;4.

This commitment focuses on children's rights and well-being rather than leveraging additional money for social services.&#10;5. The primary aim of the proposed Bill is not to criminalize parents but to improve children's positions within their families and shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment. The focus is on support programs available to parents and discouraging long-term involvement from social services in family matters.">

    <edge source="The speaker, Sally Jenkins, believes that the purpose of the increased clarity in training for various professions related to child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed approach is to create a clear message for all professionals working with children. She emphasizes that this is not about leveraging additional money for social services but a commitment to the rights of children in Wales. The training aims to empower educational professionals, who are already highly trained and aware of ACE and trauma, by focusing on and increasing their understanding of particular issues related to adverse childhood experiences.&#10;&#10;Sally Jenkins also mentions that there could be positive unintended consequences, such as reinvigorating discussions around the voice of the child within various contexts. She does not think that this Bill is a way of getting money into social services; instead, it is about reinforcing the commitment to children's rights and promoting their well-being in Wales." target="1. The proposed Bill aims to clarify how local authorities care for and nurture children in Wales, particularly by protecting them from harm as stated by Huw David. This includes discussing the implications of the Bill on local authorities and potential trajectories for referral into their services.&#10;2. The Bill is grounded in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enshrines the view that physical punishment and physical harm to a child are forms of harm. It seeks to prevent such harm by supporting parents in raising children without recourse to physical punishment. This reflects a cultural change that has taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years.&#10;3. The Bill is not intended as a way of getting money into social services, but rather about reinforcing the commitment to children's rights and promoting their well-being in Wales. It aims to create clarity in how professionals working with children approach child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences, and trauma-informed approaches.&#10;4. The Bill is expected to improve children's positions within their families by changing legislation regarding physical punishment, as research has shown that introducing such legislation across the world improves children's situations in their homes. Children find physical punishment emotionally damaging, and this view is clear among children themselves.&#10;5. The Bill aims to ensure that families come with them on this journey, and it emphasizes the need for support available to parents who struggle with parenting as a universal offer across Wales. Local authorities have been heavily involved in exploring the implications of this Bill from various perspectives, including awareness-raising and early support and intervention services for families.&#10;6. By addressing physical punishment as a form of harm, the Bill affects existing local authority responsibilities by requiring them to promote alternative methods of discipline and parenting support, ultimately contributing to a culture and value system that prioritizes children's well-being in Wales.">

The disagreement between Sally Jenkins and the children's commissioner/equal protection network revolves around the approach to defining what constitutes corporal punishment in the Bill. On one hand, Sally Jenkins emphasizes the need for greater clarity in the definition of corporal punishment, arguing that it would help address ambiguity in how children are treated and potentially prevent more serious physical or sexual abuse. This clarity, she believes, would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children and improve children's positions within their families.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the children's commissioner and the equal protection network argue for simplicity in the Bill, stating that a simpler approach would make the legislation more accessible and easier to understand for the general public. They likely believe that a simpler definition would encourage more people to report instances of corporal punishment, leading to increased protection for children and better enforcement of the law.&#10;&#10;The disagreement lies in finding the right balance between clarity and simplicity to create a Bill that effectively addresses corporal punishment while also being easily understood by the public.">

    <edge source="1. Increased referrals to children's services: While it is not anticipated that there will be a huge increase in referrals, some rise in reports related to child smacking may still occur due to increased awareness and understanding of the legislation.&#10;&#10;2. Training of staff: Implementing the new law would require training for relevant personnel within local authorities, social services, CAFCASS Cymru, police, and third-party organizations. This includes ensuring that staff understands the implications of the Bill, how it changes their roles and responsibilities, and how to respond appropriately to reports or allegations related to child smacking.&#10;&#10;3. Awareness campaigns: Raising public awareness about the new law is crucial to ensure families do not feel criminalized and understand the reporting mechanisms. This would involve designing and executing awareness campaigns targeting various stakeholders, including parents, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations. These campaigns can incur significant costs related to marketing materials, event organization, and personnel time.&#10;&#10;4. Collaborative work between agencies: Successful implementation of the Bill will require close collaboration between local authorities, Welsh Government, social services, police, CAFCASS Cymru, and third-party organizations involved in preventative services. This may involve additional expenses related to meetings, consultations, and coordination efforts.&#10;&#10;5. Cost trajectory: Understanding the cost implications during the implementation phase is essential for appropriate resource allocation and decision-making processes. This includes monitoring the number of referrals and cases, associated costs, and ensuring that resources are distributed proportionately between agencies involved in implementing the new law.&#10;&#10;6. Related costs aligned with existing initiatives: Many expenses related to staff training and awareness campaigns may be partially offset by aligning them with existing initiatives. However, this would still require significant time and effort to coordinate efforts across various stakeholders.&#10;&#10;7. Ongoing evaluation and assessment: Ensuring that the new law is effectively implemented will require ongoing monitoring and assessment of its impact on children, families, and agencies involved in implementing the legislation. This may involve additional costs related to data collection, analysis, and reporting." target="1. Over the first six months to a year, costs related to the implementation of the proposed legislation are expected to rise due to increased awareness and understanding of the new law. These costs will not only come from an increase in referrals but also from additional expenses such as training of staff, awareness-raising efforts, and other related costs.&#10;&#10;2. During this period, local authorities, Welsh Government, social services, police, CAFCASS Cymru, and third-party organizations involved in preventative services will collaborate to ensure successful implementation. They will monitor the number of referrals and cases, associated costs, and ensure that resources are distributed proportionately between agencies involved in implementing the new law.&#10;&#10;3. Some of these related costs may be aligned with existing initiatives, helping offset some expenses. However, significant time and effort will still be required to coordinate efforts across various stakeholders.&#10;&#10;4. As Dawn Bowden AM mentioned, there could be a &quot;double impact&quot; on Wales due to the culture shift brought about by the new legislation – an increase in referrals because of increased awareness and more parents seeking support services. This potential dual effect will need to be considered when evaluating the trajectory of costs during implementation.&#10;&#10;5. Over the first six months and 12 months, ongoing monitoring and assessment will help provide a clearer understanding of these costs as agencies work together to ensure families do not feel criminalized and children's rights are upheld within Welsh society.">

    <edge source="1. If an individual witnesses a child being physically punished after the proposed Bill becomes law, they may be encouraged to report it to social services departments. However, reporting such instances would likely not be mandatory for members of the public. The primary aim of the Bill is to improve children's positions within their families and shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment, focusing on support programs available to parents and discouraging long-term involvement from social services in family matters.&#10;2. When allegations are made, there will be a proportionate response as with any other law-breaking behavior. An increase in referrals to social services due to people reporting suspected cases of child abuse, including instances of smacking, might occur. This could lead to further involvement of social services in families' lives and potential mistrust between parents and educational professionals. However, the primary focus should remain on ensuring children's wellbeing and safety.&#10;3. Including children in discussions about this issue can improve their educational experiences and help them address adverse childhood experiences in several ways, fostering a culture where children feel heard and valued while promoting empathy, resilience, and emotional intelligence among their peers.&#10;4. The Welsh Government should lead the awareness-raising campaign to communicate effectively to parents, guardians, and the general public that the new law prohibiting physical punishment of children is not meant to criminalize parents. This effort will involve clarifying the intent of the legislation while addressing concerns about potential over-criminalization and emphasizing that the law aims to protect children from harm and promote positive parenting techniques. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and local communities would be essential for a successful awareness campaign." target="1. When social services professionals in Wales receive a report of domestic abuse involving a child who has been smacked, they would look into it, particularly if there are signs of harm or something clearly wrong. This assessment is carried out irrespective of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014.&#10;2. Before the implementation of this act, social services might not have taken action on some reports involving a child being smacked, especially if the perceived level of harm was below the threshold for intervention. This approach aligns with the historical view that reasonable chastisement is an acceptable form of discipline.&#10;3. With the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014, social services professionals now have a more defined framework to assess reports of domestic abuse or harm to children. While this does not necessarily mean that all reported cases of smacking will result in intervention, it emphasizes a more rigorous assessment process.&#10;4. The increased clarity in training for various professions related to child protection, safeguarding, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and trauma-informed approaches aims to empower educational professionals and create a clear message for all professionals working with children. This commitment focuses on children's rights and well-being rather than leveraging additional money for social services.&#10;5.

    <edge source="1. Responsibilities of professional educational staff: Professional educational staff have a responsibility to make referrals if they believe that a child might be experiencing significant harm or neglect. This duty is based on their close working relationship with children, which allows them to identify potential concerns. The decision to make a referral should be made carefully, considering all available evidence and legal requirements.&#10;&#10;2. Process of making referrals: When educational professionals have concerns about possible significant harm or neglect, they first gather all relevant information related to the situation. Once enough evidence has been collected, a referral is made to the Child Care Assessment Team or the police. The decision on whether the threshold for intervention has been met is made by these professionals, who have multi-agency awareness and expertise in assessing such situations.&#10;&#10;3. Determining the threshold for action: The exact threshold for child abuse is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it is mentioned that if there is a suspicion of significant harm or neglect to the child, a referral should be made to the child care assessment team or the police. This determination is best left to the professionals who have multi-agency awareness and can assess the situation thoroughly.&#10;&#10;4. Trust and relationships: While there is a risk that increased referrals might cause potential harm to relationships and create mistrust, the primary focus should be on the child's wellbeing. The goal is to ensure that professionals are aware of their responsibilities and feel confident in making necessary referrals when significant harm or neglect is suspected. Building trust with parents remains an essential aspect of this process, as professionals work daily to engage and support families." target="1. Concerns about neglect or other general worries: If educational professionals notice general concerns about a child's wellbeing, they may gather this information and make a referral to the Child Care Assessment Team. However, upon assessment, it might be determined that there is no significant harm or neglect taking place.&#10;&#10;2. Combined evidence insufficient for intervention: Sometimes, multiple pieces of information regarding a child's situation are collected but do not meet the threshold for significant harm or neglect when considered together. In such cases, these referrals may result in no further action being taken by local authorities.&#10;&#10;Examples provided by Sally Jenkins in the transcript include situations where there is a paper assessment of referrals and a look at what has happened, who is involved, and what the police have reported. These assessments aim to improve the process between police and social services, ensuring that only incidents requiring action are investigated further.">

The disagreement between Sally Jenkins and the children's commissioner/equal protection network revolves around the approach to defining what constitutes corporal punishment in the Bill. On one hand, Sally Jenkins emphasizes the need for greater clarity in the definition of corporal punishment, arguing that it would help address ambiguity in how children are treated and potentially prevent more serious physical or sexual abuse. This clarity, she believes, would contribute to shifting societal attitudes towards recognizing the need for physically safe environments for all children and improve children's positions within their families.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the children's commissioner and the equal protection network argue for simplicity in the Bill, stating that a simpler approach would make the legislation more accessible and easier to understand for the general public. They likely believe that a simpler definition would encourage more people to report instances of corporal punishment, leading to increased protection for children and better enforcement of the law.&#10;&#10;The disagreement lies in finding the right balance between clarity and simplicity to create a Bill that effectively addresses corporal punishment while also being easily understood by the public.">

    <edge source="1. Sian Gwenllian AM strongly believes that including a specific duty for raising awareness about the impact of the Bill on its face would make it clearer and more effective. She points out the precedent set by the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013, where Ministers were required to promote organ donation. Sian Gwenllian AM questions why the Welsh Government is hesitant to include such a duty in this Bill, as she thinks it would provide clarity for local authorities and front-line services on what needs to be done.&#10;2. Although Huw David acknowledges that there is a commitment from the Welsh Government to honor their commitments regarding awareness-raising campaigns and support for families during the implementation phase, he believes that having such a duty included in the Bill would make it clearer for everyone involved. However, he mentions that he is not a legislator or lawyer and therefore cannot comment on its implications.&#10;3. Sally Jenkins from the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) does not think it is essential for this duty to be included in the text of the Bill. Instead, she advocates for discussions on nuancing during the implementation phase. She emphasizes the importance of simplicity and clarity to avoid further confusion.&#10;4.

    <edge source="Based on the information provided in the transcript, if the proposed Bill becomes law, there may be an increase in reports of child smacking to social services departments. However, this does not necessarily mean that there will be a corresponding increase in long-term social services intervention in families' lives. In fact, the primary aim of the Bill is to shift societal attitudes towards physical punishment and improve children's positions within their families, with a focus on support programs available to parents.&#10;&#10;Sally Jenkins emphasizes that the current policy is to provide short-term support to families and work with them to address concerns. This approach would likely continue if the Bill becomes law. While there may be a proportionate response from social services or the police in cases where allegations of abuse are made, the aim is not to criminalize parents or subject them to long-term social services involvement for minor instances of physical punishment.&#10;&#10;The Welsh Government has committed to raising awareness about the changes and ensuring that families, carers, and parents understand the new culture and value system for children. Local authorities will work closely with relevant parties during the implementation process, focusing on early support and prevention services for families. Support services for early intervention and prevention will be available to parents and carers who may struggle with parenting, emphasizing a universal offer across Wales.&#10;&#10;It is important that resources are made available to social services departments to avoid any unintended consequences of the Bill's implementation. While there may be an increase in referrals to social services, this does not necessarily mean long-term involvement. The focus remains on short-term support and prevention services, with a commitment to maintaining trust between education settings, families, and social services." target="1. The transcript suggests that there may not be sufficient resources and services like Families First in local governments to prevent harm and support families. Speakers have expressed concerns about increased pressures on social services due to reduced funding for children's services, as well as a growing awareness of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Wales. These factors have contributed to the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales and England.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, it is essential to provide local authorities with the necessary resources to effectively implement new legislation and support social services departments. This includes early intervention and prevention services for families facing significant challenges, as well as awareness-raising campaigns to inform vulnerable children about available resources like Childline. Training and awareness within education settings should also be prioritized to ensure that safeguarding leads have the right support and resources. Schools can potentially host preventative services or signpost parents to them.&#10;&#10;Involving local authorities, social services, the Welsh Government, families, carers, and parents in the implementation process will help ensure a successful rollout of new policies and legislation. A major awareness-raising campaign can help ensure that all parties understand the changes and are on board with the new culture and value system for children.&#10;&#10;While there may be an increase in reports of child smacking to social services departments if the proposed Bill becomes law, the focus remains on short-term support and prevention services.

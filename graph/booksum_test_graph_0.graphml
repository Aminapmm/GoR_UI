    <node id="From the frequent social engagements and gatherings that Marianne Dashwood and John Willoughby attend together, we can infer that they have a strong attachment to each other. They are often seen together, standing close and scarcely speaking to anyone else, which suggests that their focus is solely on each other. This behavior makes them a subject of amusement for others, but they seem unbothered by the ridicule, indicating a deep connection between them.&#10;&#10;Elinor Dashwood, Marianne's older sister, enters into her feelings with warmth and does not see any issue with their excessive display of affection, viewing it as a natural consequence of strong affection in a young and ardent mind. However, she is not as happy as her sister during these social events because she has left behind a companion at Norland and has not found anyone to replace her there.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that while their behavior indicates an engagement between them, no explicit confirmation of this has been given to Elinor or Mrs. Dashwood, which causes some uneasiness for Elinor as she tries to interpret Willoughby's sudden and embarrassed departure from their home." />
    <node id=" and when obliged to&#10;separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and&#10;scarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them of&#10;course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and&#10;seemed hardly to provoke them.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left&#10;her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To her&#10;it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and&#10;ardent mind.&#10;&#10;This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted to&#10;Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with&#10;her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it&#10;possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her&#10;present home.&#10;&#10;Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much at&#10;ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They afforded&#10;her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,&#10;nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than&#10;ever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor" />
    <node id=" from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and&#10;Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have&#10;been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want no proof of their affection,&quot; said Elinor; &quot;but of their&#10;engagement I do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am perfectly satisfied of both.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of&#10;them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Has&#10;not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last&#10;fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future&#10;wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?&#10;Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been&#10;daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate&#10;respect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How&#10;could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that&#10;Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leave&#10;her," />
    <node id="He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw him&#10;step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the&#10;parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this&#10;sudden departure occasioned.&#10;&#10;Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.  She thought of&#10;what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby's behaviour&#10;in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of&#10;cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's&#10;invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,&#10;greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious design&#10;had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate&#10;quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in&#10;which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could&#10;most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's&#10;love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.&#10;&#10;But whatever might be the particulars of" />
    <node id=" inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances&quot;--&#10;Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,&#10;and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not&#10;otherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably have&#10;passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what&#10;concerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required but&#10;a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender&#10;recollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,&#10;in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would&#10;have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing&#10;established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the&#10;latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of&#10;all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,&#10;surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,&#10;with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse," />
    <node id=" desired.  She had nothing to say&#10;one day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity was&#10;invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she&#10;did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every&#10;thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,&#10;she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might&#10;have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presence&#10;add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,&#10;that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her&#10;solicitude about her troublesome boys.&#10;&#10;In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find&#10;a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite&#10;the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.&#10;Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even&#10;her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his&#10;attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might&#10;have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for&#10;himself, had no such" />
    <node id=",&quot; said&#10;Elinor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; cried he in the same eager tone, &quot;with all and every thing&#10;belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,&#10;should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under&#10;such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at&#10;Barton.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I flatter myself,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that even under the disadvantage&#10;of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your&#10;own house as faultless as you now do this.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There certainly are circumstances,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;which might&#10;greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of&#10;my affection, which no other can possibly share.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were&#10;fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she&#10;understood him.&#10;&#10;&quot;How often did I wish,&quot; added he, &quot;when I was at Allenham this time&#10;twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed within&#10;view of it" />
    <node id="Based on the supporting materials provided, Willoughby's character is portrayed as a gentleman who is well-regarded in society. Therefore, it would have been more honorable and consistent with his character if he had openly admitted his difficulties regarding his engagement with Marianne, especially if the marriage may not take place immediately. This openness would have reflected his integrity and respect for Marianne and her family.&#10;&#10;However, the narrative suggests that Willoughby practices secrecy regarding his engagement to Marianne, which is considered unusual and disappointing by Elinor. The text implies that an open avowal of their situation could have prevented misunderstandings and suspicions among the characters. Nonetheless, Willoughby's decision to keep things secret may be attributed to various reasons, such as the uncertain prospects of his financial situation or the disapproval of his family, which are not explicitly mentioned in the narrative.&#10;&#10;In summary, it would have been more honorable and consistent with Willoughby's character to openly admit his difficulties regarding his engagement with Marianne. However, due to various contextual factors, he opts for secrecy instead, causing confusion and concern among Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood." />
    <node id=" open avowal of his difficulties would have been more&#10;to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general&#10;character;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct&#10;on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,&#10;or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be&#10;suspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in&#10;this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?&#10;Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,&#10;it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging&#10;everything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is an&#10;engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage&#10;must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it&#10;can be observed, may now be very advisable.&quot;&#10;&#10;They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then&#10;at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to&#10;acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all" />
    <node id=" have now urged of&#10;the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be&#10;candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have&#10;very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.&#10;But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at&#10;once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at&#10;its being practiced by him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the&#10;deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I&#10;have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they&#10;ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must be&#10;highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at&#10;present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and&#10;Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have&#10;" />
    <node id=" how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather&#10;take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery&#10;for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the&#10;latter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave&#10;of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And is&#10;no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by&#10;recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely&#10;because they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we&#10;have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill&#10;of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though&#10;unavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect&#10;him of?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is&#10;the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed&#10;in him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of&#10;the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be&#10;candid in my judgment of every body." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there is substantial evidence to suggest that Willoughby and Marianne are engaged, despite the lack of verbal confirmation. Here are some reasons why:&#10;&#10;1. **Behaviors and Actions**: Willoughby's behavior towards Marianne and their circle has changed significantly, indicating a deeper commitment. He is more attentive, respectful, and affectionate, which others have interpreted as signs of an impending marriage.&#10;&#10;2. **Implied Confirmation from Mrs. Jennings**: Although not direct evidence, Mrs. Jennings's statement that she had Mr. Willoughby's groom confirm their visit to Allenham is significant. Marianne's anger at Elinor's disbelief also suggests that they did indeed visit the house. This behavior is unusual for mere acquaintances and aligns more with the actions of a couple in love.&#10;&#10;3. **Marianne's Excitement**: Marianne's delight in sharing the news about Willoughby giving her a horse, a gift often associated with courtship, also hints at an engagement.&#10;&#10;4. **Elinor's Change of Heart**: Elinor, who initially doubted their engagement, begins to believe they are indeed engaged due to the weight of these circumstantial evidences. &#10;&#10;While there is no direct confirmation of their engagement, the preponderance of circumstantial evidence suggests that Willoughby and Marianne are likely engaged." />
    <node id=" her with such&#10;indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this&#10;matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are&#10;fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we&#10;find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you&#10;would suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I&#10;require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to&#10;justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly&#10;open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.  It must&#10;be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man of&#10;honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to&#10;create alarm? can he be deceitful?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope not, I believe not,&quot; cried Elinor.  &quot;I love Willoughby,&#10;sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity" />
    <node id=" as marked a perfect agreement between&#10;them.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each&#10;other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or&#10;any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover&#10;it by accident.&#10;&#10;Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this&#10;matter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the preceding&#10;evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour&#10;with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,&#10;which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest&#10;sister, when they were next by themselves.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Elinor!&quot; she cried, &quot;I have such a secret to tell you about&#10;Marianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have said so,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;almost every day since they first&#10;met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I&#10;believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round&#10;her neck; but it turned out" />
    <node id=" to you?  How is it to be supposed that&#10;Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leave&#10;her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his&#10;affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of&#10;confidence?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I confess,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that every circumstance except ONE is in&#10;favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both&#10;on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,&#10;if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the&#10;nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting a&#10;part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him&#10;really indifferent to her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such&#10;indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You must remember, my dear mother, that" />
    <node id="ne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed&#10;heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they&#10;had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.&#10;Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that&#10;they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in&#10;walking about the garden and going all over the house.&#10;&#10;Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely&#10;that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house&#10;while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest&#10;acquaintance.&#10;&#10;As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;&#10;and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance&#10;related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry&#10;with her for doubting it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we&#10;did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do&#10;yourself?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Marianne," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the text does not explicitly provide a reason for Marianne and Willoughby concealing their engagement from Elinor and her mother. However, there are some possible interpretations that can be inferred:&#10;&#10;1. **Uncertainty regarding the engagement's outcome**: It is possible that Marianne and Willoughby have not made a formal commitment yet, and they are still weighing their options due to external factors such as financial constraints or family disapproval. By keeping their relationship private, they may avoid drawing unnecessary attention until they are certain about their future together.&#10;2. **Protecting the feelings of others**: Marianne might not want to hurt her mother's feelings by revealing an engagement that might not lead to an immediate marriage, especially if she and Willoughby have not yet discussed the details of their union. Additionally, Willoughby may be hesitant to share his intentions with Elinor out of respect for her cautious nature.&#10;3. **Elinor's skepticism**: The narrative mentions that Elinor is more reserved and suspicious than Marianne, which might lead Marianne to believe that her sister would not easily accept the news without tangible proof. As a result, Marianne may choose to reveal their engagement at a later time when she can present more concrete evidence of their commitment.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that these interpretations are based on the given text and may not fully capture the reasons behind Marianne and Willoughby's decision to conceal their engagement from Elinor and her mother." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Margaret's behavior and observations suggest that Marianne and Willoughby are likely to be engaged due to the following reasons:&#10;&#10;1. **Opportunity for Observations**: Margaret spent some time alone with Marianne and Willoughby in the parlor, giving her a chance to observe their interactions closely.&#10;2. **Important Face**: When Margaret communicates her observations to Elinor, she does so with a &quot;most important face,&quot; indicating that she has noticed something significant.&#10;3. **Secret Reveal**: Margaret tells Elinor that she believes Marianne will marry Mr. Willoughby soon, suggesting that she has picked up on subtle cues or indications of an impending engagement.&#10;4. **Additional Context**: Margaret's previous statements about Marianne and Willoughby's relationship have consistently pointed to a deepening bond between them, adding weight to her latest observation.&#10;&#10;While Margaret's observations do not provide definitive proof of an engagement, they contribute to the growing body of circumstantial evidence that suggests Marianne and Willoughby are likely to be engaged." />
    <node id="To achieve a tolerable composure of mind, it was agreed that the carriages would drive about the country. Marianne and Willoughby spent their time in the carriage driving fast through the park and keeping in the lanes while the others went on the downs. They both seemed delighted with their drive, but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes." />
    <node id=" that we&#10;did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do&#10;yourself?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with&#10;no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew&#10;that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to&#10;have any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my&#10;life.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am afraid,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;that the pleasantness of an employment&#10;does not always evince its propriety.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if&#10;there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been&#10;sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting&#10;wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very&#10;impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of&#10;your own conduct" />
    <node id=" in the morning, for we must&#10;walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.&quot;&#10;&#10;He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and&#10;two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from&#10;being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her&#10;mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the&#10;night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly&#10;satisfied with her remaining at home.&#10;&#10;On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and&#10;servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that&#10;her conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;&#10;but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her&#10;to expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came&#10;hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her&#10;handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.&#10;Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the" />
    <node id=" something by way of being&#10;happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although&#10;happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a&#10;tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  The&#10;carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never&#10;looked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the park&#10;very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them&#10;was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return&#10;of all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said&#10;only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others&#10;went on the downs.&#10;&#10;It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that&#10;every body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of the&#10;Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly&#10;twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.&#10;Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.&#10;Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long&#10;seated" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Marianne and Willoughby are remaining unusually silent about their relationship despite their open behavior towards each other due to several possible reasons. Firstly, they might be uncertain about the outcome of their engagement or waiting for the right time to officially announce it. Secondly, they could be trying to protect the feelings of others, such as Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood, by not sharing their news prematurely. Lastly, they may believe that Elinor, being more cautious and skeptical, would require more concrete evidence before accepting their engagement, which Marianne chooses to reveal at a later time.&#10;&#10;Elinor herself acknowledges that every circumstance points towards their engagement except for the total silence on the subject from both of them, which she finds unusual. Her mother, Mrs. Dashwood, suggests that Elinor is accusing Marianne and Willoughby of concealment when she has been observing their incautiousness daily. However, Elinor maintains that she wants proof of their engagement, not just their affection for each other.&#10;&#10;In summary, the reasons behind Marianne and Willoughby's silence about their relationship could be a combination of uncertainty, protection of feelings, and the belief that their actions have already conveyed their intentions clearly enough. Elinor remains unconvinced until she receives explicit confirmation of their engagement." />
    <node id="Elinor's distress occurs during the group's conversation when Edward mentions a man with the initial 'F' who is Elinor's supposed favorite. Margaret's response, which reveals that she knows about Marianne and Willoughby's relationship, causes laughter and discomfort for Elinor. This situation likely reminds Elinor of her own unresolved romantic feelings for Edward and his engagement to Lucy Steele, who also has the initial 'F'. The group's attempts to change the subject after Edward's comment inadvertently highlights Elinor's distressing situation, making it difficult for her to laugh along with everyone else." />
    <node id=" his pocket-book.&quot;&#10;&#10;For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not&#10;withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance&#10;was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.&#10;&#10;Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory&#10;to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the&#10;park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular&#10;favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,&#10;Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, &quot;I must not&#10;tell, may I, Elinor?&quot;&#10;&#10;This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.&#10;But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixed&#10;on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a&#10;standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.&#10;&#10;Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good&#10;to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to&#10;Margaret,&#10;&#10;&quot;Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right" />
    <node id=" wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might&#10;have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for&#10;himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in&#10;conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the&#10;indifference of her sister.&#10;&#10;Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect&#10;that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.&#10;This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from&#10;him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by&#10;mutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed on&#10;Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint&#10;smile, &quot;Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second&#10;attachments.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;her opinions are all romantic.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting on&#10;the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.&#10;A few years however will" />
    <node id="From Colonel Brandon's comment about &quot;second attachments&quot; and his behavior in the park, Elinor infers that he may have experienced the misery of disappointed love before. When he says, &quot;Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second attachments,&quot; Elinor suspects that he is referring to his own personal history. This suspicion is reinforced when he becomes emotionally expressive after making this comment, leading Elinor to believe that he may be recalling a tender memory related to past love. However, Elinor does not press the issue, respecting Colonel Brandon's privacy and choosing not to pry further into his personal life." />

The idea however started by her, was&#10;immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion&#10;mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of&#10;rain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked&#10;Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of&#10;different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not so&#10;easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.&#10;&#10;A party was formed this evening for going" />

She noticed a deepening bond and increased affection between them, which led her to believe they would soon marry.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding Mr. Willoughby's specific action related to Marianne's hair, the narrative does not provide direct evidence. However, there is an earlier reference to Margaret believing that Marianne wears Willoughby's picture around her neck, suggesting some sort of romantic gesture or keepsake exchange may have occurred between them.&#10;&#10;Additionally, it is worth noting that Elinor initially doubts Margaret's claim about Marianne and Willoughby entering Allenham (Mrs. Smith's house). However, when she finds out that Margaret's information is accurate, she becomes convinced of their engagement, reaffirming the evidence presented earlier." />
    <node id="Miss Williams is Colonel Brandon's natural daughter, making her his illegitimate child. This revelation was made by Mrs. Jennings, who mentioned that Miss Williams is a relation of Colonel Brandon and that she resembles him strongly. There is also a suggestion that Colonel Brandon might be leaving his fortune to Miss Williams, which has led to speculation among the group. The news about Miss Williams initially brought the group together, but their plans were disrupted when Colonel Brandon received a letter and left abruptly, causing disappointment and curiosity among the members of the party." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;I can guess what his business is, however,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings&#10;exultingly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you, ma'am?&quot; said almost every body.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And who is Miss Williams?&quot; asked Marianne.&#10;&#10;&quot;What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have&#10;heard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a&#10;very near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the&#10;young ladies.&quot; Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,&#10;&quot;She is his natural daughter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonel&#10;will leave her all his fortune.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret&#10;on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as&#10;they were all got together, they must do something by way of being&#10;happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although&#10;happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure" />

She was prepared to be wet through,&#10;fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for&#10;they did not go at all.&#10;&#10;By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they&#10;were to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it had&#10;rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,&#10;and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits and&#10;good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the&#10;greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.&#10;&#10;While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among the&#10;rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at the&#10;direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is the matter with Brandon?&quot; said Sir John." />
    <node id="by say, in a low voice to Marianne, &quot;There&#10;are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one of&#10;them.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this&#10;trick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter was&#10;of his own writing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no doubt of it,&quot; replied Marianne.&#10;&#10;&quot;There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of&#10;old,&quot; said Sir John, &quot;when once you are determined on anything.  But,&#10;however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are the&#10;two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked&#10;up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his&#10;usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.&quot;&#10;&#10;Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of&#10;disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be&#10;unavoidable.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then, when will you come back again?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope we shall see you at Barton,&quot; added her ladys" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear madam,&quot; said Lady Middleton, &quot;recollect what you are saying.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?&quot; said&#10;Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, indeed, it is not.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Whom do you mean, ma'am?&quot; said he, colouring a little.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! you know who I mean.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am particularly sorry, ma'am,&quot; said he, addressing Lady Middleton,&#10;&quot;that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which&#10;requires my immediate attendance in town.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In town!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings.  &quot;What can you have to do in town at&#10;this time of year?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My own loss is great,&quot; he continued, &quot;in being obliged to leave so&#10;agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence&#10;is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.&quot;&#10;&#10;What a blow upon them all was this!&#10;&#10;&quot;But" />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his&#10;steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the&#10;wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great&#10;wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all&#10;the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, with&#10;little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must&#10;be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could&#10;have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape&#10;them all.&#10;&#10;&quot;Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,&quot; said she.&#10;&quot;I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances&#10;may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two&#10;thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I do&#10;think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can&#10;it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the&#10;truth of it.  Perhaps it is about" />
    <node id="Yes, despite Marianne's dismissal of societal expectations and her own confusion about Mrs. Jennings' censure, visiting Mr. Willoughby's future home, Allenham, was still an imprudent action on her part. This visit has provided further grounds for gossip among the people in their circle, as evidenced by Mrs. Jennings' determination to find out where they had been and her subsequent laughter after Marianne's confusion.&#10;&#10;Moreover, by visiting Allenham, Marianne has unintentionally reinforced the notion that she and Willoughby have a closer relationship than what is appropriate for two individuals who are not engaged. In this regard, regardless of societal expectations or Mrs. Jennings' opinions, Marianne's actions could be perceived as indiscreet and premature, given the norms of their society and the potential consequences it might bring upon her reputation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Marianne might not personally agree with the criticisms she receives from Mrs. Jennings or other people in their circle, it is still imprudent for her to visit Mr. Willoughby's future home since such actions could be misconstrued by society and give rise to further speculation about their relationship status." />
    <node id=" Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very&#10;impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of&#10;your own conduct?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of&#10;impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.&#10;I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  I&#10;am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.&#10;Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.&#10;Willoughby's, and--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be&#10;justified in what you have done.&quot;&#10;&#10;She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;&#10;and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her&#10;sister again, and said with great good humour, &quot;Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS&#10;rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted&#10;particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure&#10;you" />
    <node id=" usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.&#10;Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long&#10;seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to&#10;Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, &quot;I have found you out in&#10;spite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, &quot;Where, pray?&quot;--&#10;&#10;&quot;Did not you know,&quot; said Willoughby, &quot;that we had been out in my&#10;curricle?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined&#10;to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss&#10;Marianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,&#10;I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when&#10;I was there six years ago.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed&#10;heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they&#10;had been" />
    <node id="Marianne Dashwood's emotional state and Willoughby's heavy disappointment were caused by a serious quarrel between them, which took place the night before. This information is inferred from Marianne's distress when her mother and Elinor return from their visit to Lady Middleton, as well as Willoughby's unusual behavior during his departure. However, the exact reason for their disagreement remains unknown within the narrative at this point." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, I don't have direct details about Edward's departure or Marianne's role in it. However, given that Edward mentioned a man with the initial 'F' who is Elinor's supposed favorite, and Margaret's subsequent reaction revealing her knowledge of Marianne and Willoughby's relationship, it seems plausible that Edward may have been alluding to this situation.&#10;&#10;The text suggests that there might be some similarities between Edward's 'F' person and Marianne's Willoughby, which could explain why Margaret brings up the topic of Marianne's love life. This could also potentially cause discomfort for Elinor, as she has unresolved feelings for Edward and is aware of his engagement to Lucy Steele, who also has the initial 'F'.&#10;&#10;As for Edward's relationship with your family, the narrative portrays it as friendly and cordial. Elinor in particular shares a strong bond with him, making her even more distressed about his engagement to Lucy Steele. However, without further context or information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer regarding the true circumstances surrounding Edward's departure." />
    <node id="Marianne Dashwood's extreme emotional distress and inability to control her tears during dinner are caused by a serious disagreement with Willoughby, which took place the night before. The exact reason for their argument remains unknown at this point in the narrative, but it has left both parties significantly upset. Marianne's tears and distress during dinner are a result of her emotional vulnerability due to the fight, as well as the difficulty she faces in avoiding subjects that remind her of Willoughby in conversation with her family." />
    <node id="or was then&#10;at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to&#10;acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.&#10;&#10;They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the&#10;room and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyes&#10;were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then&#10;restrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, could&#10;neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently&#10;pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude&#10;was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.&#10;&#10;This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  She&#10;was without any power, because she was without any desire of command&#10;over herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby&#10;overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most&#10;anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they&#10;spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings&#10;connected with him.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Marianne and Mr. Willoughby were at Allenham, which is Mrs. Smith's house, spending a pleasant morning together, as they wanted to visit the place since it would one day be Mr. Willoughby's. Elinor was surprised that they entered the house while Mrs. Smith was present because she found it unlikely that Marianne would consent to go there with just Mr. Willoughby and no other acquaintance, especially considering they had not been introduced to Mrs. Smith. Additionally, given Marianne's usual sensibilities regarding propriety, Elinor would have expected her to avoid such a situation." />
    <node id=".  I have just received my&#10;dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of&#10;exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To London!--and are you going this morning?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Almost this moment.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her&#10;business will not detain you from us long I hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;He coloured as he replied, &quot;You are very kind, but I have no idea of&#10;returning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith are&#10;never repeated within the twelvemonth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in the&#10;neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, can&#10;you wait for an invitation here?&quot;&#10;&#10;His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only&#10;replied, &quot;You are too good.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equal&#10;amazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood&#10;first spoke." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide explicit information about the reason behind Willoughby's sudden departure or the &quot;very heavy disappointment&quot; he experienced. However, it can be inferred that these circumstances might be related to his serious disagreement with Marianne Dashwood, as well as potential difficulties in his financial situation or familial disapproval of their relationship. The text suggests that an open avowal of their situation could have prevented misunderstandings and suspicions among the characters; nevertheless, Willoughby opts for secrecy, causing confusion and concern among Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it seems that Marianne does have some level of self-awareness regarding the potential impropriety of visiting Allenham with Mr. Willoughby, as evidenced by her blush and response to Elinor's comment. However, she still downplays the significance of societal expectations and censure, suggesting that she does not fully grasp the potential consequences of their actions on her reputation.&#10;&#10;While Marianne may not explicitly express doubt about the appropriateness of visiting Allenham, her willingness to acknowledge Elinor's concern and admit that it &quot;was rather ill-judged&quot; suggests a degree of reflection and self-criticism that she had not previously exhibited. Nonetheless, she still justifies her actions based on Mr. Willoughby's desires and the future likelihood of their ownership of the property, rather than fully acknowledging the potential impact on her reputation or considering how others might perceive their relationship.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Marianne does show some signs of self-awareness and reflection regarding her conduct, she still seems to be somewhat naive and dismissive of societal expectations and the potential consequences of their actions on her reputation. She continues to prioritize her own desires and emotions over considerations of propriety and social norms." />
    <node id="The plan for the proposed outing on the following day is to visit a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, which belongs to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon. The group will go in open carriages and have a sail on a noble piece of water as part of the amusement. Cold provisions will be taken, and the party has been formed at least twice every summer for the last ten years by Sir John, who is particularly warm in its praise. However, some members of the party express concerns about the timing of the excursion, as it has rained every day for the last fortnight, making the grounds likely to be muddy and the weather uncertain. Mrs. Dashwood also mentions that the proprietor is abroad, and they can only visit with Colonel Brandon's interest. Despite these concerns, the party seems eager to go on the outing, excluding Colonel Brandon, who has determined not to join them." />

The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and&#10;Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed&#10;to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at&#10;least, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained a&#10;noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the&#10;morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages&#10;only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a&#10;complete party of pleasure.&#10;&#10;To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,&#10;considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the&#10;last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already" />

How little did I then think that the very first&#10;news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,&#10;would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate&#10;satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of&#10;prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account&#10;for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?&quot; speaking to her in a lowered&#10;voice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, &quot;And yet this house&#10;you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?

    <node id="Marianne found it necessary to accept a horse from her brother because they have lived together for years and she knows him well, but she considers it an impropriety to do so from Willoughby because her judgment of him has not been formed as thoroughly. Elinor's appeal to Marianne's affection for their mother helps in convincing Marianne to decline the offer by representing the inconveniences that their indulgent mother would draw on herself if she consented to this increase of establishment, which ultimately leads to Marianne promising not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next that it must be declined." />
    <node id=" with each other, and seven&#10;days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of&#10;greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from&#10;Willoughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived together&#10;for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew her&#10;sister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach&#10;her the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection for&#10;her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent&#10;mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she&#10;consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly&#10;subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent&#10;kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw&#10;him next, that it must be declined.&#10;&#10;She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the&#10;cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to&#10;him in a low voice" />
    <node id="Edward Ferdinand's feelings of attachment to the cottage were especially strong one evening because it brought back memories of his acquaintance with the Dashwood family, who lived there. He expressed his strong opposition towards changing the cottage by warmly opposing any alteration or improvement to it. He felt that the simplicity and small size of the cottage contributed to its charm and was against making it larger or more extravagant. He even went so far as to say that he would build a similar cottage if he were rich enough, with all its original features. This display of affection for the cottage reflected his fond feelings towards the Dashwood family and their time spent together in that space." />

No. THAT I will&#10;never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch&#10;to its size, if my feelings are regarded.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do not be alarmed,&quot; said Miss Dashwood, &quot;nothing of the kind will be&#10;done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am heartily glad of it,&quot; he cried.  &quot;May she always be poor, if she&#10;can employ her riches no better.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank" />

But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them&#10;relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,&#10;she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their&#10;general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind&#10;of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her&#10;making any inquiry of Marianne.&#10;&#10;Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than&#10;Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishing&#10;tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the&#10;family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The&#10;cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more&#10;of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general&#10;engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him&#10;out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest&#10;of the day" />
    <node id="The young man that Margaret alludes to as Elinor's particular favorite is Edward Ferrars, who is her secret love interest. However, Edward is already privately engaged to Lucy Steele, which causes distress for Elinor when his name comes up in conversation.

    <node id="Based on the description provided by the speaker, Allenham house has a charming exterior and a remarkably pretty sitting room upstairs. This room is of a comfortable size, with modern furniture it would be delightful. The corner room has windows on two sides, offering picturesque views. On one side, you look across the bowling-green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood. On the other side, you have a view of the church and village, and beyond them, of those fine bold hills that they had often admired. However, the current state of the furniture is forlorn, but Elinor imagines that with just a couple of hundred pounds worth of renovations, it could become one of the pleasantest summer rooms in England.&#10;&#10;Elinor takes such delight in describing Allenham house because she wants to listen to her sister's excitement about visiting the place and visualizing its potential, despite the forlorn state of its current furniture. Elinor is usually more practical and less romantic than Marianne, but here she indulges in imagining how beautiful the room could be with some updates. It's also a way for her to participate in her sister's happiness, which is a common theme in the novel as Elinor often has to suppress her own feelings to take care of her family members." />
    <node id=" go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted&#10;particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure&#10;you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice&#10;comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would&#10;be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On&#10;one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a&#10;beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church&#10;and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so&#10;often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be&#10;more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a&#10;couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the&#10;pleasantest summer-rooms in England.&quot;&#10;&#10;Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,&#10;she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his&#10;steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and" />
    <node id="Elinor is determined not to dispose of the unused money in a way that would be painful to Willoughby because she values his local attachment and doesn't want to sacrifice his feelings for monetary gain. She understands that he has a deep emotional connection to the cottage where they are staying, and sees it as faultless. Although Elinor points out some defects in the cottage, such as dark narrow stairs and a smoking kitchen, Willoughby enthusiastically confirms that he would want all of those features if he were to rebuild the house.&#10;&#10;Elinor's promise to not dispose of the unused sum in a manner painful to Willoughby also demonstrates her strong sense of integrity and loyalty towards people she cares about, as well as her respect for their feelings and wishes. She understands that laying the money uselessly by might be a better option than causing distress to someone she loves or compromising his happiness.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Elinor's commitment to not using the money against Willoughby's wishes highlights her maturity and emotional intelligence, as she strives to maintain harmony and balance in her relationships despite any personal disagreements or misunderstandings that may arise. By making this promise, Elinor reinforces her role as a compassionate, thoughtful, and responsible individual within the narrative." />
    <node id="If Elinor had been given the opportunity to listen to Mrs. Jennings' description of Allenham without interruption, she would have described every room in the house with equal delight. This shows that Elinor is interested in knowing more about Allenham, which is significant because it is the estate associated with Willoughby, Marianne's love interest.&#10;&#10;What filled Elinor's mind after Colonel Brandon's sudden departure from the park was the cause of his sudden termination and his steadiness in concealing it. This event raised Mrs. Jennings' wonder and speculation about some melancholy matter that might have befallen him, possibly related to financial distress or perhaps something else entirely. Elinor, being more attuned to Colonel Brandon's behavior, may have had her own suspicions about the cause of his departure, but she respects his privacy and does not pry further into his personal life." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Marianne and Mr. Willoughby spent a considerable amount of time at Allenham, which is Mrs. Smith's house. They went for a walk in the garden and explored the entire house. Elinor was surprised about their visit to Allenham because she found it unlikely that Marianne would consent to go there with just Mr. Willoughby, without any other acquaintance present, especially considering they had not been introduced to Mrs. Smith. Additionally, given Marianne's usual sensibilities regarding propriety, Elinor would have expected her to avoid such a situation." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, while there is no explicit confirmation of Marianne and Willoughby's engagement, there are several indications that suggest they are likely to be engaged. Margaret's observations of their deepening bond and increased affection, as well as Elinor's discovery of Margaret's accurate information about Marianne and Willoughby entering Allenham together, contribute to this conclusion. Elinor finds every circumstance pointing towards their engagement except for the total silence on the subject from both of them, which she finds unusual. Therefore, it is plausible to infer that Marianne and Willoughby have reached an understanding and become engaged, although they have not yet made an official announcement or shared the news with Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood." />
    <node id="Miss Williams is Colonel Brandon's natural daughter, making her his illegitimate child. This connection is revealed by Mrs. Jennings, who mentions that Miss Williams is a relation of Colonel Brandon and strongly resembles him. The news about Miss Williams initially brings the group together, but their plans are disrupted when Colonel Brandon receives a letter and leaves abruptly, causing disappointment and curiosity among the members of the party. Miss Williams's existence suggests that Colonel Brandon may have had a previous romantic relationship, which could be the source of his melancholy demeanor and reflections on &quot;second attachments.&quot; The group's decision to go on an outing the following day is likely their way of coping with Colonel Brandon's absence and cheering up Elinor after her distress." />
    <node id="The narrative does not explicitly provide a reason for Marianne and Willoughby concealing their engagement from Elinor and her mother. However, there are possible interpretations that can be inferred: uncertainty regarding the engagement's outcome, protecting the feelings of others, or Elinor's skepticism about accepting the news without tangible proof. According to the speaker's perspective, Willoughby and Marianne might be considered unnecessarily secretive, as openness could prevent misunderstandings and suspicions among the characters. It would have been more honorable and consistent with Willoughby's character to admit his difficulties regarding the engagement openly. In summary, whether there is justification for their secrecy depends on various contextual factors and individual perspectives." />
    <node id="Willoughby's altered manners and unusual behavior, such as his sudden departure and secrecy regarding his relationship with Marianne Dashwood, might be attributed to several factors. One potential reason could be the serious disagreement they had the night before their quarrel, which is implied within the narrative. Another possible factor could be difficulties in his financial situation or familial disapproval of their relationship, as these are common issues that cause strain in romantic relationships, especially during this time period.&#10;&#10;However, Willoughby does not make a straightforward explanation of his situation to Elinor, which causes her suspicions about his integrity, because he opts for secrecy instead. This choice may stem from embarrassment or shame regarding the reasons for his departure or a desire to protect Marianne from potential pain or disappointment. Nevertheless, this decision leads to confusion and concern among Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood.&#10;&#10;In addition, Willoughby's emotional state when he and Marianne visit Allenham with Mrs. Smith suggests that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. His reaction to the house and his conversation with Elinor hint at a deeper connection to the place and a possible history there. However, the exact nature of this history or its relevance to their current situation remains unclear within the narrative at this point.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Marianne's imprudent and surprising behavior, such as her delight in receiving a horse from Willoughby despite their sudden separation, suggests that she may be blind to his true intentions or motivations. This dynamic adds another layer of complexity to the situation and highlights the potential consequences of secrecy and miscommunication within romantic relationships." />

Here are some reasons why:&#10;&#10;1. **Behaviors and Actions**: Willoughby's behavior towards Marianne and their circle has changed significantly, indicating a deeper commitment. He is more attentive, respectful, and affectionate, which others have interpreted as signs of an impending marriage.&#10;&#10;2. **Implied Confirmation from Mrs. Jennings**: Although not direct evidence, Mrs. Jennings's statement that she had Mr. Willoughby's groom confirm their visit to Allenham is significant. Marianne's anger at Elinor's disbelief also suggests that they did indeed visit the house. This behavior is unusual for mere acquaintances and aligns more with the actions of a couple in love.&#10;&#10;3. **Marianne's Excitement**: Marianne's delight in sharing the news about Willoughby giving her a horse, a gift often associated with courtship, also hints at an engagement.&#10;&#10;4. **Elinor's Change of Heart**: Elinor, who initially doubted their engagement, begins to believe they are indeed engaged due to the weight of these circumstantial evidences. &#10;&#10;While there is no direct confirmation of their engagement, the preponderance of circumstantial evidence suggests that Willoughby and Marianne are likely engaged.">

However, there are some possible interpretations that can be inferred:&#10;&#10;1. **Uncertainty regarding the engagement's outcome**: It is possible that Marianne and Willoughby have not made a formal commitment yet, and they are still weighing their options due to external factors such as financial constraints or family disapproval. By keeping their relationship private, they may avoid drawing unnecessary attention until they are certain about their future together.&#10;2. **Protecting the feelings of others**: Marianne might not want to hurt her mother's feelings by revealing an engagement that might not lead to an immediate marriage, especially if she and Willoughby have not yet discussed the details of their union. Additionally, Willoughby may be hesitant to share his intentions with Elinor out of respect for her cautious nature.&#10;3. **Elinor's skepticism**: The narrative mentions that Elinor is more reserved and suspicious than Marianne, which might lead Marianne to believe that her sister would not easily accept the news without tangible proof. As a result, Marianne may choose to reveal their engagement at a later time when she can present more concrete evidence of their commitment.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that these interpretations are based on the given text and may not fully capture the reasons behind Marianne and Willoughby's decision to conceal their engagement from Elinor and her mother.">

Firstly, they might be uncertain about the outcome of their engagement or waiting for the right time to officially announce it. Secondly, they could be trying to protect the feelings of others, such as Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood, by not sharing their news prematurely. Lastly, they may believe that Elinor, being more cautious and skeptical, would require more concrete evidence before accepting their engagement, which Marianne chooses to reveal at a later time.&#10;&#10;Elinor herself acknowledges that every circumstance points towards their engagement except for the total silence on the subject from both of them, which she finds unusual. Her mother, Mrs. Dashwood, suggests that Elinor is accusing Marianne and Willoughby of concealment when she has been observing their incautiousness daily. However, Elinor maintains that she wants proof of their engagement, not just their affection for each other.&#10;&#10;In summary, the reasons behind Marianne and Willoughby's silence about their relationship could be a combination of uncertainty, protection of feelings, and the belief that their actions have already conveyed their intentions clearly enough. Elinor remains unconvinced until she receives explicit confirmation of their engagement.">

This behavior is unusual for mere acquaintances and aligns more with the actions of a couple in love.&#10;&#10;3. **Marianne's Excitement**: Marianne's delight in sharing the news about Willoughby giving her a horse, a gift often associated with courtship, also hints at an engagement.&#10;&#10;4. **Elinor's Change of Heart**: Elinor, who initially doubted their engagement, begins to believe they are indeed engaged due to the weight of these circumstantial evidences. &#10;&#10;While there is no direct confirmation of their engagement, the preponderance of circumstantial evidence suggests that Willoughby and Marianne are likely engaged.">

However, there are some possible interpretations that can be inferred:&#10;&#10;1. **Uncertainty regarding the engagement's outcome**: It is possible that Marianne and Willoughby have not made a formal commitment yet, and they are still weighing their options due to external factors such as financial constraints or family disapproval. By keeping their relationship private, they may avoid drawing unnecessary attention until they are certain about their future together.&#10;2. **Protecting the feelings of others**: Marianne might not want to hurt her mother's feelings by revealing an engagement that might not lead to an immediate marriage, especially if she and Willoughby have not yet discussed the details of their union. Additionally, Willoughby may be hesitant to share his intentions with Elinor out of respect for her cautious nature.&#10;3. **Elinor's skepticism**: The narrative mentions that Elinor is more reserved and suspicious than Marianne, which might lead Marianne to believe that her sister would not easily accept the news without tangible proof. As a result, Marianne may choose to reveal their engagement at a later time when she can present more concrete evidence of their commitment.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that these interpretations are based on the given text and may not fully capture the reasons behind Marianne and Willoughby's decision to conceal their engagement from Elinor and her mother.">

One potential reason could be the serious disagreement they had the night before their quarrel, which is implied within the narrative. Another possible factor could be difficulties in his financial situation or familial disapproval of their relationship, as these are common issues that cause strain in romantic relationships, especially during this time period.&#10;&#10;However, Willoughby does not make a straightforward explanation of his situation to Elinor, which causes her suspicions about his integrity, because he opts for secrecy instead. This choice may stem from embarrassment or shame regarding the reasons for his departure or a desire to protect Marianne from potential pain or disappointment. Nevertheless, this decision leads to confusion and concern among Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood.&#10;&#10;In addition, Willoughby's emotional state when he and Marianne visit Allenham with Mrs. Smith suggests that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. His reaction to the house and his conversation with Elinor hint at a deeper connection to the place and a possible history there. However, the exact nature of this history or its relevance to their current situation remains unclear within the narrative at this point.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Marianne's imprudent and surprising behavior, such as her delight in receiving a horse from Willoughby despite their sudden separation, suggests that she may be blind to his true intentions or motivations. This dynamic adds another layer of complexity to the situation and highlights the potential consequences of secrecy and miscommunication within romantic relationships.">

Elinor is usually more practical and less romantic than Marianne, but here she indulges in imagining how beautiful the room could be with some updates.

Firstly, they might be uncertain about the outcome of their engagement or waiting for the right time to officially announce it. Secondly, they could be trying to protect the feelings of others, such as Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood, by not sharing their news prematurely. Lastly, they may believe that Elinor, being more cautious and skeptical, would require more concrete evidence before accepting their engagement, which Marianne chooses to reveal at a later time.&#10;&#10;Elinor herself acknowledges that every circumstance points towards their engagement except for the total silence on the subject from both of them, which she finds unusual.

However, Elinor maintains that she wants proof of their engagement, not just their affection for each other.&#10;&#10;In summary, the reasons behind Marianne and Willoughby's silence about their relationship could be a combination of uncertainty, protection of feelings, and the belief that their actions have already conveyed their intentions clearly enough.

This visit has provided further grounds for gossip among the people in their circle, as evidenced by Mrs. Jennings' determination to find out where they had been and her subsequent laughter after Marianne's confusion.&#10;&#10;Moreover, by visiting Allenham, Marianne has unintentionally reinforced the notion that she and Willoughby have a closer relationship than what is appropriate for two individuals who are not engaged. In this regard, regardless of societal expectations or Mrs. Jennings' opinions, Marianne's actions could be perceived as indiscreet and premature, given the norms of their society and the potential consequences it might bring upon her reputation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Marianne might not personally agree with the criticisms she receives from Mrs. Jennings or other people in their circle, it is still imprudent for her to visit Mr. Willoughby's future home since such actions could be misconstrued by society and give rise to further speculation about their relationship status.">

However, she still downplays the significance of societal expectations and censure, suggesting that she does not fully grasp the potential consequences of their actions on her reputation.&#10;&#10;While Marianne may not explicitly express doubt about the appropriateness of visiting Allenham, her willingness to acknowledge Elinor's concern and admit that it &quot;was rather ill-judged&quot; suggests a degree of reflection and self-criticism that she had not previously exhibited. Nonetheless, she still justifies her actions based on Mr. Willoughby's desires and the future likelihood of their ownership of the property, rather than fully acknowledging the potential impact on her reputation or considering how others might perceive their relationship.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Marianne does show some signs of self-awareness and reflection regarding her conduct, she still seems to be somewhat naive and dismissive of societal expectations and the potential consequences of their actions on her reputation. She continues to prioritize her own desires and emotions over considerations of propriety and social norms.">

Lastly, they may believe that Elinor, being more cautious and skeptical, would require more concrete evidence before accepting their engagement, which Marianne chooses to reveal at a later time.&#10;&#10;Elinor herself acknowledges that every circumstance points towards their engagement except for the total silence on the subject from both of them, which she finds unusual.

In this regard, regardless of societal expectations or Mrs. Jennings' opinions, Marianne's actions could be perceived as indiscreet and premature, given the norms of their society and the potential consequences it might bring upon her reputation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Marianne might not personally agree with the criticisms she receives from Mrs. Jennings or other people in their circle, it is still imprudent for her to visit Mr. Willoughby's future home since such actions could be misconstrued by society and give rise to further speculation about their relationship status.">

On the other side, you have a view of the church and village, and beyond them, of those fine bold hills that they had often admired. However, the current state of the furniture is forlorn, but Elinor imagines that with just a couple of hundred pounds worth of renovations, it could become one of the pleasantest summer rooms in England.&#10;&#10;Elinor takes such delight in describing Allenham house because she wants to listen to her sister's excitement about visiting the place and visualizing its potential, despite the forlorn state of its current furniture. Elinor is usually more practical and less romantic than Marianne, but here she indulges in imagining how beautiful the room could be with some updates. It's also a way for her to participate in her sister's happiness, which is a common theme in the novel as Elinor often has to suppress her own feelings to take care of her family members.">

She understands that laying the money uselessly by might be a better option than causing distress to someone she loves or compromising his happiness.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Elinor's commitment to not using the money against Willoughby's wishes highlights her maturity and emotional intelligence, as she strives to maintain harmony and balance in her relationships despite any personal disagreements or misunderstandings that may arise. By making this promise, Elinor reinforces her role as a compassionate, thoughtful, and responsible individual within the narrative.">

    <edge source="The narrative does not provide explicit information about the reason behind Willoughby's sudden departure or the &quot;very heavy disappointment&quot; he experienced. However, it can be inferred that these circumstances might be related to his serious disagreement with Marianne Dashwood, as well as potential difficulties in his financial situation or familial disapproval of their relationship. The text suggests that an open avowal of their situation could have prevented misunderstandings and suspicions among the characters; nevertheless, Willoughby opts for secrecy, causing confusion and concern among Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood." target="Willoughby's altered manners and unusual behavior, such as his sudden departure and secrecy regarding his relationship with Marianne Dashwood, might be attributed to several factors. One potential reason could be the serious disagreement they had the night before their quarrel, which is implied within the narrative. Another possible factor could be difficulties in his financial situation or familial disapproval of their relationship, as these are common issues that cause strain in romantic relationships, especially during this time period.&#10;&#10;However, Willoughby does not make a straightforward explanation of his situation to Elinor, which causes her suspicions about his integrity, because he opts for secrecy instead. This choice may stem from embarrassment or shame regarding the reasons for his departure or a desire to protect Marianne from potential pain or disappointment. Nevertheless, this decision leads to confusion and concern among Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood.&#10;&#10;In addition, Willoughby's emotional state when he and Marianne visit Allenham with Mrs. Smith suggests that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. His reaction to the house and his conversation with Elinor hint at a deeper connection to the place and a possible history there. However, the exact nature of this history or its relevance to their current situation remains unclear within the narrative at this point.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Marianne's imprudent and surprising behavior, such as her delight in receiving a horse from Willoughby despite their sudden separation, suggests that she may be blind to his true intentions or motivations. This dynamic adds another layer of complexity to the situation and highlights the potential consequences of secrecy and miscommunication within romantic relationships.">

On the other side, you have a view of the church and village, and beyond them, of those fine bold hills that they had often admired. However, the current state of the furniture is forlorn, but Elinor imagines that with just a couple of hundred pounds worth of renovations, it could become one of the pleasantest summer rooms in England.&#10;&#10;Elinor takes such delight in describing Allenham house because she wants to listen to her sister's excitement about visiting the place and visualizing its potential, despite the forlorn state of its current furniture. Elinor is usually more practical and less romantic than Marianne, but here she indulges in imagining how beautiful the room could be with some updates. It's also a way for her to participate in her sister's happiness, which is a common theme in the novel as Elinor often has to suppress her own feelings to take care of her family members." target=" go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted&#10;particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure&#10;you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice&#10;comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would&#10;be delightful.

Margaret's observations of their deepening bond and increased affection, as well as Elinor's discovery of Margaret's accurate information about Marianne and Willoughby entering Allenham together, contribute to this conclusion. Elinor finds every circumstance pointing towards their engagement except for the total silence on the subject from both of them, which she finds unusual. Therefore, it is plausible to infer that Marianne and Willoughby have reached an understanding and become engaged, although they have not yet made an official announcement or shared the news with Elinor and Mrs. Dashwood.">

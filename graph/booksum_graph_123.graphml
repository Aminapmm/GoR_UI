Sumach resented her rejection more than she did the deaths of&#10;her husband and brother, and there was little probability that the&#10;woman would pardon a man who had so unequivocally preferred death to&#10;her embraces. Without her forgiveness, there was scarce a hope that&#10;the tribe could be induced to overlook its loss, and even to Rivenoak,&#10;himself, much as he was disposed to pardon, the fate of our hero now&#10;appeared to be almost hopelessly sealed.&#10;&#10;When the whole band was arrayed around the captive, a grave silence, so&#10;much the more threatening from its profound quiet, pervaded the&#10;place. Deerslayer perceived that the women and boys had been preparing&#10;splinters of the fat pine roots, which he well knew were to be stuck&#10;into his flesh, and set in flames, while two or three of the young men&#10;held the thongs of bark with which he was to be bound.

    <node id=" the result with Indian&#10;patience, while the females prepared the feast that was to celebrate the&#10;termination of the affair, whether it proved fortunate or otherwise for&#10;our hero. No one betrayed feeling, and an indifferent observer, beyond&#10;the extreme watchfulness of the sentinels, would have detected no&#10;extraordinary movement or sensation to denote the real state of things.&#10;Two or three old women put their heads together, and it appeared&#10;unfavorably to the prospects of Deerslayer, by their scowling looks, and&#10;angry gestures; but a group of Indian girls were evidently animated by a&#10;different impulse, as was apparent by stolen glances that expressed pity&#10;and regret. In this condition of the camp, an hour soon glided away.&#10;&#10;Suspense is perhaps the feeling of all others that is most difficult to&#10;be supported. When Deerslayer landed, he fully expected in the course of&#10;a few minutes to undergo the tortures of an Indian revenge, and he&#10;was prepared to meet his fate manfully; but, the delay proved far more&#10;trying than the nearer approach of suffering, and the intended victim&#10;began seriously to meditate some desperate effort at escape, as it&#10;might" />
    <node id=" young. The Iroquois are not poorer than the wolves. They have&#10;villages, and wigwams, and fields of corn; the Good Spirits will be&#10;tired of watching them alone. My people must go back and see to their&#10;own business. There will be joy in the lodges when they hear our whoop&#10;from the forest! It will be a sorrowful whoop; when it is understood,&#10;grief will come after it. There will be one scalp-whoop, but there&#10;will be only one.

Deerslayer must say whether another scalp shall be on our pole.&#10;Two lodges are empty; a scalp, living or dead, is wanted at each door.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then take 'em dead, Huron,&quot; firmly, but altogether without dramatic&#10;boasting, returned the captive. &quot;My hour is come, I do suppose, and what&#10;must be, must.

    <node id=" so soon as the fate of Deerslayer was&#10;determined, the seniors of the party having come to the opinion that it&#10;was getting to be hazardous to delay their departure for Canada beyond&#10;the coming night. In short the band waited merely to dispose of this&#10;single affair, ere it brought matters with those in the Castle to a&#10;crisis, and prepared to commence its retreat towards the distant waters&#10;of Ontario.&#10;&#10;It was an imposing scene into which Deerslayer now found himself&#10;advancing. All the older warriors were seated on the trunk of the fallen&#10;tree, waiting his approach with grave decorum. On the right stood the&#10;young men, armed, while left was occupied by the women and children. In&#10;the centre was an open space of considerable extent, always canopied by&#10;trees, but from which the underbrush, dead wood, and other obstacles had&#10;been carefully removed. The more open area had probably been much used&#10;by former parties, for this was the place where the appearance of a&#10;sward was the most decided. The arches of the woods, even at high noon,&#10;cast their sombre shadows on the spot, which the brilliant rays of the&#10;sun that struggled" />
    <node id="Deerslayer finds himself in a critical and tantalizing situation after discovering the missing canoe and the dead body of the Panther on the beach. He is now certain that the Iroquois tribe intended to leave him stranded and prisoner on the narrow tongue of land, with no other means of escape but swimming. However, he knows that swimming would be dangerous as the canoe would likely be sent in chase, and his chances of success would be uncertain. He also knows that the raft is on the other side of the point, at a considerable distance. Deerslayer lies quiet, trusting to his sense of hearing and waiting to see if anyone approaches by swimming. Eventually, he makes a plan to reach the canoe, run the gauntlet of a few rifles, and escape, as the warriors have left their weapons behind." />
    <node id="rolled about the area, gradually getting nearer and nearer&#10;to the spot where he had landed, when he suddenly quickened his pace,&#10;though carefully avoiding all appearance of flight, and pushing aside&#10;the bushes, he stepped upon the beach. The canoe was gone, nor could he&#10;see any traces of it, after walking to the northern and southern verges&#10;of the point, and examining the shores in both directions. It&#10;was evidently removed beyond his reach and knowledge, and under&#10;circumstances to show that such had been the intention of the savages.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer now better understood his actual situation. He was a prisoner&#10;on the narrow tongue of land, vigilantly watched beyond a question, and&#10;with no other means of escape than that of swimming. He, again, thought&#10;of this last expedient, but the certainty that the canoe would be sent&#10;in chase, and the desperate nature of the chances of success deterred&#10;him from the undertaking. While on the strand, he came to a spot where&#10;the bushes had been cut, and thrust into a small pile. Removing a few of&#10;the upper branches, he found beneath them the dead body of the Panther.&#10;He knew that it was kept" />
    <node id=" skill into a last effort, and&#10;cast himself forward so as to fall into the bottom of the light craft&#10;without materially impeding its way. Here he remained on his back, both&#10;to regain his breath and to cover his person from the deadly rifle.&#10;The lightness, which was such an advantage in paddling the canoe, now&#10;operated unfavorably. The material was so like a feather, that the boat&#10;had no momentum, else would the impulse in that smooth and placid sheet&#10;have impelled it to a distance from the shore that would have rendered&#10;paddling with the hands safe. Could such a point once be reached,&#10;Deerslayer thought he might get far enough out to attract the attention&#10;of Chingachgook and Judith, who would not fail to come to his relief&#10;with other canoes, a circumstance that promised everything. As the young&#10;man lay in the bottom of the canoe, he watched its movements by studying&#10;the tops of the trees on the mountainside, and judged of his distance by&#10;the time and the motions. Voices on the shore were now numerous, and he&#10;heard something said about manning the raft, which, fortunately for the&#10;fugitive, lay at" />
    <node id=" This was&#10;close work, but our hero had too lately gone through that which was&#10;closer to be appalled. He lay still half a minute longer, and then he&#10;saw the summit of an oak coming slowly within his narrow horizon.&#10;&#10;Unable to account for this change, Deerslayer could restrain his&#10;impatience no longer. Hitching his body along, with the utmost caution,&#10;he got his eye at the bullet hole, and fortunately commanded a very&#10;tolerable view of the point. The canoe, by one of those imperceptible&#10;impulses that so often decide the fate of men as well as the course of&#10;things, had inclined southerly, and was slowly drifting down the lake.&#10;It was lucky that Deerslayer had given it a shove sufficiently vigorous&#10;to send it past the end of the point, ere it took this inclination, or&#10;it must have gone ashore again. As it was, it drifted so near it as to&#10;bring the tops of two or three trees within the range of the young man's&#10;view, as has been mentioned, and, indeed, to come in quite as close&#10;proximity with the extremity of the point as was at all safe" />
    <node id=" Voices on the shore were now numerous, and he&#10;heard something said about manning the raft, which, fortunately for the&#10;fugitive, lay at a considerable distance on the other side of the point.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the situation of Deerslayer had not been more critical that&#10;day than it was at this moment. It certainly had not been one half as&#10;tantalizing. He lay perfectly quiet for two or three minutes, trusting&#10;to the single sense of hearing, confident that the noise in the lake&#10;would reach his ears, did any one venture to approach by swimming.&#10;Once or twice he fancied that the element was stirred by the cautious&#10;movement of an arm, and then he perceived it was the wash of the water&#10;on the pebbles of the strand; for, in mimicry of the ocean, it is seldom&#10;that those little lakes are so totally tranquil as not to possess a&#10;slight heaving and setting on their shores. Suddenly all the voices&#10;ceased, and a death like stillness pervaded the spot: A quietness as&#10;profound as if all lay in the repose of inanimate life. By this time,&#10;the canoe had drifted so far as to render nothing" />
    <node id=" of escape by the woods, he made the best of his&#10;way towards the canoe. He knew where it lay; could it be reached, he had&#10;only to run the gauntlet of a few rifles, and success would be certain.&#10;None of the warriors had kept their weapons, which would have retarded&#10;their speed, and the risk would come either from the uncertain hands&#10;of the women, or from those of some well grown boy; though most of the&#10;latter were already out in hot pursuit. Everything seemed propitious to&#10;the execution of this plan, and the course being a continued descent,&#10;the young man went over the ground at a rate that promised a speedy&#10;termination to his toil.&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer approached the point, several women and children were&#10;passed, but, though the former endeavoured to cast dried branches&#10;between his legs, the terror inspired by his bold retaliation on&#10;the redoubted Panther was so great, that none dared come near enough&#10;seriously to molest him. He went by all triumphantly and reached the&#10;fringe of bushes. Plunging through these, our hero found himself once&#10;more in the lake, and within fifty feet of the canoe. Here he ceased" />
    <node id="1. The change in the drift of Deerslayer's canoe was caused by the &quot;baffling nature of the light currents of the air, aided by some eddies in the water.&quot; It was not due to Rivenoak's actions.&#10;2. Rivenoak helped the canoe reach the point, seemingly, to make it easier for Deerslayer to land. The narrative states that Rivenoak &quot;had so far aided the slow progress of the boat, as to draw it on the point,&quot; which led Deerslayer to believe that the Hurons intended to leave him stranded on the land. However, the true motivations behind Rivenoak's actions are not explicitly stated in the text, leaving room for interpretation. It is possible that Rivenoak wanted to ensure Deerslayer was marooned and had no means of escape, or perhaps he aimed to bring Deerslayer closer to make it easier to capture him. The narrative does not provide sufficient information to determine the exact reason with certainty." />
    <node id=" savages could so completely control&#10;their thirst for revenge, he was resolved to be as calm as themselves,&#10;and to trust his fate to the interposition of the currents and air.&#10;&#10;Some additional ten minutes may have passed in this quiescent manner, on&#10;both sides, when Deerslayer thought he heard a slight noise, like a low&#10;rubbing against the bottom of his canoe. He opened his eyes of course,&#10;in expectation of seeing the face or arm of an Indian rising from the&#10;water, and found that a canopy of leaves was impending directly over&#10;his head. Starting to his feet, the first object that met his eye was&#10;Rivenoak, who had so far aided the slow progress of the boat, as to&#10;draw it on the point, the grating on the strand being the sound that had&#10;first given our hero the alarm. The change in the drift of the canoe had&#10;been altogether owing to the baffling nature of the light currents of&#10;the air, aided by some eddies in the water.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come,&quot; said the Huron with a quiet gesture of authority, to order his&#10;prisoner to land, &quot;my young friend has sailed about till he is tired; he&#10;" />
    <node id=" good deal of surprise&#10;and some uneasiness, for he had never known it to occur, in the course&#10;of his experience among the Delawares. He suspected, however, and&#10;rightly, that a change of encampment was intended, and that the mystery&#10;of the movement was resorted to in order to work on his apprehensions.&#10;&#10;Rivenoak walked up the vista of trees as soon as he ceased speaking,&#10;leaving Deerslayer by himself. The chief disappeared behind the covers&#10;of the forest, and one unpractised in such scenes might have believed&#10;the prisoner left to the dictates of his own judgment. But the young&#10;man, while he felt a little amazement at the dramatic aspect of things,&#10;knew his enemies too well to fancy himself at liberty, or a free&#10;agent. Still, he was ignorant how far the Hurons meant to carry&#10;their artifices, and he determined to bring the question, as soon as&#10;practicable, to the proof. Affecting an indifference he was far from&#10;feeling, he strolled about the area, gradually getting nearer and nearer&#10;to the spot where he had landed, when he suddenly quickened his pace,&#10;though carefully avoiding all" />
    <node id="From Deerslayer's perspective, the two Iroquois warriors have been killed in a fair fight during a hunting accident. He believes that their deaths were not intentional and that the Great Spirit did not specifically intend for them to die at his hands. However, Sumach, the wife and sister of the deceased warriors, sees it differently. She blames Deerslayer for their deaths and views it as an unprovoked act of cruelty by the pale-face.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer is aware that Sumach holds him responsible for the deaths of her husband and brother, and he knows that she and the tribe are seeking revenge. Despite this, he remains committed to the truth and refuses to take part in any deception or adopt red-skin forms to avoid punishment.&#10;&#10;However, Deerslayer is also aware that his chances of escaping the Iroquois' wrath are slim, especially since the tribe intends to use torture and possibly execute him for his actions. He tries to come up with a plan to reach the canoe, run the gauntlet of a few rifles, and escape, but he knows that it will be difficult to avoid the tribe's vengeance.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Sumach sees Deerslayer as a cruel pale-face who has taken the lives of her loved ones, Deerslayer sees himself as a man who has acted in self-defense and is now facing the consequences of his actions." />
    <node id=" What&#10;you say, that will you do. You are just. When you have done wrong, it is&#10;your wish to do right, again, as soon as you can. Here, is the Sumach;&#10;she is alone in her wigwam, with children crying around her for&#10;food--yonder is a rifle; it is loaded and ready to be fired. Take the&#10;gun, go forth and shoot a deer; bring the venison and lay it before the&#10;widow of Le Loup Cervier, feed her children; call yourself her husband.&#10;After which, your heart will no longer be Delaware, but Huron; le&#10;Sumach's ears will not hear the cries of her children; my people will&#10;count the proper number of warriors.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I fear'd this, Rivenoak,&quot; answered Deerslayer, when the other had&#10;ceased speaking--&quot;yes, I did dread that it would come to this. Howsever,&#10;the truth is soon told, and that will put an end to all expectations on&#10;this head. Mingo, I'm white and Christian born; 't would ill become me&#10;to take a wife, under red-skin forms, from among heathen" />
    <node id=" till he grins in their faces, and tells 'em the hour is come!&quot;&#10;&#10;While this soliloquy was being pronounced, the hunter advanced into the&#10;area, where to his surprise he saw Hetty alone, evidently awaiting his&#10;return. The girl carried the Bible under her arm, and her face, over&#10;which a shadow of gentle melancholy was usually thrown, now seemed sad&#10;and downcast. Moving nearer, Deerslayer spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor Hetty,&quot; he said, &quot;times have been so troublesome, of late, that&#10;I'd altogether forgotten you; we meet, as it might be to mourn over what&#10;is to happen. I wonder what has become of Chingachgook and Wah!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did you kill the Huron, Deerslayer?--&quot; returned the girl&#10;reproachfully. &quot;Don't you know your commandments, which say 'Thou shalt&#10;not kill!' They tell me you have now slain the woman's husband and&#10;brother!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's true, my good Hetty--'tis gospel truth, and I'll not deny what has&#10;come to pass. But, you must remember, gal, that many things are lawful" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer has formed a new plan to reach the canoe and escape from the Iroquois tribe. He plans to run the gauntlet of a few rifles and make a desperate attempt to reach the canoe. This is because he knows that escaping through the woods is no longer an option, as he is virtually surrounded on three sides and has the lake on the fourth. Deerslayer also knows that the Iroquois tribe intends to use torture and possibly execute him for his actions, so he realizes that his chances of escaping their wrath are slim. However, he remains committed to the truth and refuses to take part in any deception or adopt red-skin forms to avoid punishment." />
    <node id=" which he had first fled. The nature of the calls in&#10;the glen, however, soon made him uneasy, and he sprang upon the summit&#10;again, in order to reconnoitre. No sooner did he reach the height than&#10;he was seen, and the chase renewed. As it was better footing on the&#10;level ground, Deerslayer now avoided the side hill, holding his flight&#10;along the ridge; while the Hurons, judging from the general formation of&#10;the land, saw that the ridge would soon melt into the hollow, and kept&#10;to the latter, as the easiest mode of heading the fugitive. A few, at&#10;the same time, turned south, with a view to prevent his escaping in that&#10;direction, while some crossed his trail towards the water, in order to&#10;prevent his retreat by the lake, running southerly.&#10;&#10;The situation of Deerslayer was now more critical than it ever had&#10;been. He was virtually surrounded on three sides, having the lake on&#10;the fourth. But he had pondered well on all the chances, and took&#10;his measures with coolness, even while at the top of his speed. As is&#10;generally the case with the vigorous border men," />
    <node id=" sufficiently toilsome for one contending&#10;for life, to render it painfully oppressive. There, however, he&#10;slackened his speed to recover breath, proceeding even at a quick walk,&#10;or a slow trot, along the more difficult parts of the way. The Hurons&#10;were whooping and leaping behind him, but this he disregarded, well&#10;knowing they must overcome the difficulties he had surmounted ere they&#10;could reach the elevation to which he had attained. The summit of the&#10;first hill was now quite near him, and he saw, by the formation of the&#10;land, that a deep glen intervened before the base of a second hill could&#10;be reached. Walking deliberately to the summit, he glanced eagerly about&#10;him in every direction in quest of a cover. None offered in the ground,&#10;but a fallen tree lay near him, and desperate circumstances required&#10;desperate remedies. This tree lay in a line parallel to the glen, at the&#10;brow of the hill. To leap on it, and then to force his person as close&#10;as possible under its lower side, took but a moment. Previously to&#10;disappearing from his pursuers, however, Deerslayer stood on the height&#10;" />

Could he now have seen any probable opening for an&#10;escape, the attempt would not have been delayed a minute. But the case&#10;seem'd desperate. He was aware of the line of sentinels, and felt&#10;the difficulty of breaking through it, unharmed. The lake offered&#10;no advantages, as the canoe would have given his foes the greatest&#10;facilities for overtaking him; else would he have found it no difficult&#10;task to swim as far as the castle. As he walked about the point, he even&#10;examined the spot to ascertain if it offered no place of concealment,&#10;but its openness, its size, and the hundred watchful glances that were&#10;turned towards him, even while those who made them" />
    <node id="The woman, Sumach, became furious and enraged when the man, Deerslayer, refused her marriage proposals. Her tenderness disappeared and was replaced by fury, rage, mortified pride, and wrath. She made the arches of the forest ring with screams and flew forward at her victim without deigning a reply in words. The reaction of Sumach highlights the significance of marriage and the importance of honor in her tribe. Her anger and volcanic wrath can be seen as a manifestation of her humiliation and the frustration of not being able to fulfill her desires, as well as the pressure from her tribe to secure a husband for herself." />
    <node id=" whose imagination was far&#10;from seconding the appeal of the widow, and who began to grow restive&#10;under the vivid pictures she was drawing, &quot;all this is nothing to me.&#10;People and kindred must take care of their own fatherless, leaving them&#10;that have no children to their own loneliness. As for me, I have no&#10;offspring, and I want no wife. Now, go away Sumach; leave me in the&#10;hands of your chiefs, for my colour, and gifts, and natur' itself cry&#10;out ag'in the idee of taking you for a wife.&quot;&#10;&#10;It is unnecessary to expatiate on the effect of this downright refusal&#10;of the woman's proposals. If there was anything like tenderness in her&#10;bosom--and no woman was probably ever entirely without that feminine&#10;quality--it all disappeared at this plain announcement. Fury, rage,&#10;mortified pride, and a volcano of wrath burst out, at one explosion,&#10;converting her into a sort of maniac, as it might beat the touch of a&#10;magician's wand. Without deigning a reply in words, she made the arches&#10;of the forest ring with screams, and then flew forward at her victim," />
    <node id=" supporters, her&#10;husband and brother, were both gone, few cared about concealing their&#10;aversion. Nevertheless, it had become a point of honor to punish the&#10;pale-face who disdained a Huron woman, and more particularly one who&#10;coolly preferred death to relieving the tribe from the support of a&#10;widow and her children. The young men showed an impatience to begin&#10;to torture that Rivenoak understood, and, as his older associates&#10;manifested no disposition to permit any longer delay, he was compelled&#10;to give the signal for the infernal work to proceed.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

No Christian girl could, or would do that! I never&#10;shall be the wife of Hurry, I know, but were he my husband no man should&#10;ever be it, again, after his death!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought it would get to this, Hetty, when you come to understand&#10;sarcumstances.

    <node id="erslayer might be prevailed on to enter her&#10;wigwam, in preference to entering the world of spirits, and this, too,&#10;with a success that previous symptoms scarcely justified. All this was&#10;the result of a resolution on the part of the chief to leave no proper&#10;means unemployed, in order to get transferred to his own nation the&#10;greatest hunter that was then thought to exist in all that region,&#10;as well as a husband for a woman who he felt would be likely to be&#10;troublesome, were any of her claims to the attention and care of the&#10;tribe overlooked.&#10;&#10;In conformity with this scheme, the Sumach had been secretly advised to&#10;advance into the circle, and to make her appeal to the prisoner's sense&#10;of justice, before the band had recourse to the last experiment. The&#10;woman, nothing loth, consented, for there was some such attraction in&#10;becoming the wife of a noted hunter, among the females of the tribes, as&#10;is experienced by the sex, in more refined life, when they bestow their&#10;hands on the affluent.

The animal from which he got his name does not glare on his&#10;intended prey with more frightful ferocity than his eyes gleamed on the&#10;captive, nor was his arm backward in seconding the fierce resentment&#10;that almost consumed his breast.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dog of the pale-faces!&quot; he exclaimed in Iroquois, &quot;go yell among the&#10;curs of your own evil hunting grounds!&quot;&#10;&#10;The denunciation was accompanied by an appropriate action. Even while&#10;speaking his arm was lifted, and the tomahawk hurled. Luckily the loud&#10;tones of the speaker had drawn the eye of Deerslayer towards him, else&#10;would that moment have probably closed his career. So great was the&#10;dexterity with which this dangerous weapon was thrown, and so deadly the&#10;intent, that" />

This strategy allowed him to gain distance from his pursuers and make his escape more challenging for them. He knew that turning or doubling back would put escape out of the question due to the greater number of pursuers who could easily overtake or outwit a fugitive in such situations.&#10;   &#10;2. Deerslayer ran in a straight line because he was aware of the line of sentinels and felt the difficulty of breaking through it unharmed. The lake offered no advantages for him, as the canoe would give his foes the greatest facilities for overtaking him. Additionally, he knew that he could outrun any single Indian pursuer but not the entire group, which had the advantage in numbers and position.&#10;&#10;By employing these strategies, Deerslayer gained more than a hundred yards on even the leading men of the Hurons, buying himself time and space to come up with a new plan for escape." />
    <node id="&#10;delay caused by these fruitless attempts was of great service to the&#10;fugitive, who had gained more than a hundred yards on even the leading&#10;men of the Hurons, ere something like concert and order had entered&#10;into the chase. To think of following with rifles in hand was out of&#10;the question, and after emptying their pieces in vague hopes of wounding&#10;their captive, the best runners of the Indians threw them aside, calling&#10;out to the women and boys to recover and load them, again, as soon as&#10;possible.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer knew too well the desperate nature of the struggle in which&#10;he was engaged to lose one of the precious moments. He also knew that&#10;his only hope was to run in a straight line, for as soon as he began to&#10;turn, or double, the greater number of his pursuers would put escape out&#10;of the question. He held his way therefore, in a diagonal direction up&#10;the acclivity, which was neither very high nor very steep in this part&#10;of the mountain, but which was sufficiently toilsome for one contending&#10;for life, to render it painfully oppressive. There, however, he&#10;slackened his speed to recover breath" />
    <node id=", and took&#10;his measures with coolness, even while at the top of his speed. As is&#10;generally the case with the vigorous border men, he could outrun any&#10;single Indian among his pursuers, who were principally formidable to&#10;him on account of their numbers, and the advantages they possessed in&#10;position, and he would not have hesitated to break off in a straight&#10;line at any spot, could he have got the whole band again fairly behind&#10;him. But no such chance did, or indeed could now offer, and when he&#10;found that he was descending towards the glen, by the melting away of&#10;the ridge, he turned short, at right angles to his previous course,&#10;and went down the declivity with tremendous velocity, holding his way&#10;towards the shore. Some of his pursuers came panting up the hill in&#10;direct chase, while most still kept on in the ravine, intending to head&#10;him at its termination.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer had now a different, though a desperate project in view.&#10;Abandoning all thoughts of escape by the woods, he made the best of his&#10;way towards the canoe. He knew where it lay; could it be reached, he had&#10;" />

Previously to&#10;disappearing from his pursuers, however, Deerslayer stood on the height&#10;and gave a cry of triumph, as if exulting at the sight of the descent&#10;that lay before him. In the next instant he was stretched beneath the&#10;tree.&#10;&#10;No sooner was this expedient adopted, than the young man ascertained how&#10;desperate had been his own efforts, by the violence of the pulsations in&#10;his frame. He could hear his heart beat, and his breathing was like the&#10;action of a bellows, in quick motion. Breath was gained, however,&#10;and the heart soon ceased to throb as if about to break through its&#10;confinement. The footsteps of those who toiled up the opposite side&#10;of the acclivity were now audible, and presently voices and treads&#10;announced the arrival of the pursuers. The foremost shouted as they&#10;reached the height; then, fearful that their enemy would escape under&#10;favor of the descent, each leaped upon the fallen tree and plunged into&#10;the ravine, trusting to get a sight of the pursued ere he reached the&#10;bottom.

This is mentioned in the text as an explanation for why the canoe didn't crash into the point again after drifting close to it.&#10;2. Deerslayer's vigorous shove played a role in this by providing enough momentum for the canoe to continue past the end of the point, even after it began drifting towards the shore due to the light current of air. If Deerslayer had not given the canoe such a strong push, it would have likely crashed into the point again and become stuck on the shore." />

The&#10;distance could not much have exceeded a hundred feet, though fortunately&#10;a light current of air from the southwest began to set it slowly off&#10;shore.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer now felt the urgent necessity of resorting to some expedient&#10;to get farther from his foes, and if possible to apprise his friends&#10;of his situation. The distance rendered the last difficult, while the&#10;proximity to the point rendered the first indispensable. As was usual in&#10;such craft, a large, round, smooth stone was in each end of the canoe,&#10;for the double purpose of seats and ballast; one of these was within&#10;reach of his feet. This stone he contrived to get so far between his&#10;legs as to reach it with his hands, and then he managed to roll it to&#10;the side of its fellow in the bows, where the two served to keep the&#10;trim of the light boat, while he worked his own body as far aft as&#10;possible.

They admire his spirit, and there is a strong desire to adopt him into the tribe. However, some members such as the Panther and his sister Le Sumach, driven by native ferocity and revenge, disagree with this wish. The Panther holds the captive in subjection due to his inherent ferocity, while Le Sumach, whose husband and brother have fallen by the captive's hand, is fueled by a corroding passion for revenge, preventing her from admitting any gentler feelings at the moment.

Still there were dissenters&#10;from this wish, among the principal of whom might be classed the&#10;Panther, and his sister, le Sumach, so called from the number of her&#10;children, who was the widow of le Loup Cervier, now known to have fallen&#10;by the hand of the captive. Native ferocity held one in subjection,&#10;while the corroding passion of revenge prevented the other from&#10;admitting any gentler feeling at the moment. Not so with Rivenoak.

Nevertheless, he had influence; and was far&#10;from being altogether without just claims to its possession. Like most&#10;men who reason more than they feel, the Huron was not addicted to the&#10;indulgence of the more ferocious passions of his people: he had been&#10;commonly found on the side of mercy, in all the scenes of vindictive&#10;torture and revenge that had occurred in his tribe since his own&#10;attainment to power. On the present occasion, he was reluctant to&#10;proceed to extremities, although the provocation was so great.

One&#10;was a senior, well known for eloquence in debate, wisdom in council, and&#10;prudence in measures; while his great competitor, if not his rival, was&#10;a brave distinguished in war, notorious for ferocity, and remarkable, in&#10;the way of intellect, for nothing but the cunning and expedients of the&#10;war path. The first was Rivenoak, who has already been introduced to the&#10;reader, while the last was called le Panth'ere, in the language of the&#10;Canadas, or the Panther, to resort to the vernacular of the English&#10;colonies. The appellation of the fighting chief was supposed to indicate&#10;the qualities of the warrior, agreeably to a practice of the red man's&#10;nomenclature, ferocity, cunning and treachery being, perhaps, the&#10;distinctive features of his character.

    <node id="The Huron orator conveys to the captured pale-face, referred to as Deerslayer, that he will be treated honorably as a brave prisoner since he has killed one of their warriors. The Hurons intend to uphold their code of honor, which requires them to torture and execute Deerslayer for his actions, unless he can redeem himself by bringing off proof of victory through the taking of a trophy, such as his captor's scalp. This is a way for the Hurons to assert their dominance over the pale-face and disgrace the Delawares, their rivals. The orator also implies that Deerslayer might have an opportunity to live among them if he can prove himself worthy of such acceptance. However, this possibility remains uncertain as it depends on various factors, including the decisions of the chiefs and the reactions of the young men." />

You will&#10;show them it is not so; your heart is stout, as well as your body. It&#10;is a pleasure to make such a prisoner; should my warriors say that the&#10;death of le Loup Cervier ought not to be forgotten, and that he cannot&#10;travel towards the land of spirits alone, that his enemy must be sent&#10;to overtake him, they will remember that he fell" />

To slay,&#10;and not to bring off the proof of victory, indeed, was scarcely deemed&#10;honorable, even these rude and fierce tenants of the forest, like their&#10;more nurtured brethren of the court and the camp, having set up for&#10;themselves imaginary and arbitrary points of honor, to supplant the&#10;conclusions of the right and the decisions of reason.&#10;&#10;The Hurons had been divided in their opinions concerning the probability&#10;of their captive's return. Most among them, indeed, had not expected it&#10;possible for a pale-face to come back voluntarily, and meet the known&#10;penalties of an Indian torture; but a few of the seniors expected better&#10;things from one who had already shown himself so singularly cool, brave&#10;and upright. The party had come to its decision, however, less in&#10;the expectation of finding the pledge redeemed, than in the hope of&#10;disgracing the Delawares by casting into their teeth the delinquency&#10;of one bred in their villages.

Without deigning a reply in words, she made the arches&#10;of the forest ring with screams, and then flew forward at her victim,&#10;seizing him by the hair, which she appeared resolute to draw out by the&#10;roots. It was some time before her grasp could be loosened. Fortunately&#10;for the prisoner her rage was blind; since his total helplessness left&#10;him entirely at her mercy. Had it been better directed it might have&#10;proved fatal before any relief could have been offered. As it was, she&#10;did succeed in wrenching out two or three handsful of hair, before the&#10;young men could tear her away from her victim.&#10;&#10;The insult that had been offered to the Sumach was deemed an insult to&#10;the whole tribe; not so much, however, on account of any respect that&#10;was felt for the woman, as on account of the honor of the Huron nation.&#10;Sumach, herself, was generally considered to be as acid as the berry&#10;from which she derived her name, and now that her great supporters, her&#10;husband and brother, were both gone, few cared about concealing their&#10;aversion.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the husband was an Iroquois warrior who was killed in a hunting accident from Deerslayer's perspective. He believes that the death was not intentional and that it occurred during a fair fight. The brother, on the other hand, was killed when he threw his tomahawk at an unarmed prisoner, which includes Deerslayer himself. In response, Deerslayer defended himself and raised a hand in self-defense, which he believes is justifiable according to the rules of war and his own principles. He argues that it would have been against nature not to defend himself in such a situation, and it would have done discredit to his training and gifts as a skilled hunter and warrior. Therefore, Deerslayer sees his actions as necessary and lawful in war, even though they may be considered unlawful in peace." />

To render their&#10;voices harsh, it would seem to require active, malignant, passions,&#10;though, when excited, their screams can rise to a sufficiently&#10;conspicuous degree of discordancy to assert their claim to possess&#10;this distinctive peculiarity of the sex. The Sumach was not altogether&#10;without feminine attraction, however, and had so recently been deemed&#10;handsome in her tribe, as not to have yet learned the full influence&#10;that time and exposure produce on man, as well as on woman. By an&#10;arrangement of Rivenoak's, some of the women around her had been&#10;employing the time in endeavoring to persuade the bereaved widow that&#10;there was still a hope Deerslayer might be prevailed on to enter her&#10;wigwam, in preference to entering the world of spirits, and this, too,&#10;with a success" />

Instead of getting anxious or revealing himself, he continued to lie quiet and watch every movement below with jealous vigilance. He had already leaped over a tree into a ravine, creating a gap between him and his pursuers. By staying still and not rising to flee, Deerslayer ensured that the Hurons would have to work harder to locate his trail, giving him more time to plan his next move.

Presently all were in the bottom&#10;of the glen, quite a hundred feet below him, and some had even ascended&#10;part of the opposite hill, when it became evident an inquiry was making&#10;as to the direction he had taken. This was the critical moment, and one&#10;of nerves less steady, or of a training that had been neglected, would&#10;have seized it to rise and fly. Not so with Deerslayer. He still lay&#10;quiet, watching with jealous vigilance every movement below, and fast&#10;regaining his breath.&#10;&#10;The Hurons now resembled a pack of hounds at fault.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer's shifting between white and Native American customs and feelings is influenced by his cultural background, personal principles, and survival instincts. As a white man living among the Native Americans, he has adopted some of their ways but still holds onto his European values and beliefs.&#10;&#10;In a feverish haste situation, such as when he discovers the missing canoe and the dead body of the Panther, Deerslayer's actions reflect his commitment to the truth, refusal to take part in deception, and strategic thinking. He lies quiet, trusting his sense of hearing, and waits to see if anyone approaches by swimming. This shows that he is relying on his instincts and skills as a hunter and warrior to navigate the dangerous situation, rather than adopting Native American forms or customs.&#10;&#10;However, Deerslayer's actions also demonstrate his respect for Native American culture and traditions. When he decides to run the gauntlet of a few rifles and make a desperate attempt to reach the canoe, he is aware that this plan may put him at odds with the Iroquois tribe's customs and beliefs. Nevertheless, he feels justified in taking this action because he believes it is necessary for his survival and escape from their wrath.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer's shifting between white and Native American customs and feelings is a complex process influenced by various factors, including his cultural background, personal principles, and survival instincts. His actions during a feverish haste situation reflect his ability to adapt to new circumstances while staying true to his values and beliefs." />
    <node id="The speaker, Deerslayer, believes it is morally impossible for him to marry Sumach due to their differences in age, race, religion, and culture. He is a young white Christian man, while she is an older Native American woman who practices a different religion. Deerslayer sees these differences as significant barriers to marriage, stating that it is against reason and nature for them to wed.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Deerslayer points out several qualities that make Hetty more suitable for Hurry than Sumach. He describes Hetty as a &quot;comely young Christian&quot; with a good heart, a pleasant smile, and kind eyes. These positive attributes suggest that Hetty would make a better partner for Hurry, both in terms of compatibility and happiness.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Sumach is portrayed as an angry and vengeful woman who attacks Deerslayer when he rejects her marriage proposals. This behavior reinforces the idea that Sumach may not be the best match for Hurry, as she is more concerned with seeking revenge than building a healthy relationship.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer believes it is morally impossible for him to marry Sumach due to their significant differences in age, race, religion, and culture. He sees Hetty as a more suitable partner for Hurry, given her positive qualities and compatibility with him." />

    <node id="The natives removed the prisoner's canoe and set up sentinels to ensure that Deerslayer would not escape easily, despite being granted apparent liberty. This action suggests that their culture draws fine distinctions in cases of captivity, as they value the challenge of overtaking or outwitting a fugitive when the stakes are high. They often give their victims a chance to evade torture, considering it honorable for both the captor and the captured if the latter manages to escape from such extraordinary vigilance. This highlights the native's complex code of conduct, where they balance their desire for revenge with their sense of honor and respect for bravery." />

As soon as the latter ended, three or&#10;four young men fell back from among the armed group, and disappeared.&#10;Then it was signified to the prisoner that he was at liberty to go at&#10;large on the point, until a council was held concerning his fate. There&#10;was more of seeming, than of real confidence, however, in this apparent&#10;liberality, inasmuch as the young men mentioned already formed a line of&#10;sentinels across the breadth of the point, inland, and escape from any&#10;other part was out of the question. Even the canoe was removed beyond&#10;this line of sentinels, to a spot where it was considered safe from&#10;any sudden attempt. These precautions did not proceed from a failure of&#10;confidence, but from the circumstance that the prisoner had now complied&#10;with all the required conditions of his parole, and it would have been&#10;considered a commendable and honorable exploit to escape from his foes.&#10;So nice, indeed, were the distinctions drawn by the savages in cases of&#10;this nature, that they often gave their victims a chance to evade the&#10;torture, deeming it as creditable to" />

Several of the elder warriors stood near him,&#10;but, now that the brother of Sumach had fallen, there was no longer&#10;any recognised chief present whose influence and authority offered a&#10;dangerous rivalry to his own. Nevertheless, it is well known that little&#10;which could be called monarchical or despotic entered into the politics&#10;of the North American tribes, although the first colonists, bringing&#10;with them to this hemisphere the notions and opinions of their own&#10;countries, often dignified the chief men of those primitive nations&#10;with the titles of kings and princes. Hereditary influence did certainly&#10;exist, but there is much reason to believe it existed rather as a&#10;consequence of hereditary merit and acquired qualifications, than as a&#10;birthright. Rivenoak, however, had not even this claim, having risen to&#10;consideration purely by the force of talents, sagacity, and, as Bacon&#10;expresses it in relation to all distinguished statesmen, &quot;by a union of&#10;great and mean qualities;&quot; a truth of which the career of the profound" />

A common, but low exclamation of surprise and admiration escaped&#10;every mouth, and the grim warriors looked at each other, some with envy&#10;and disappointment, some with astonishment at the precise accuracy of&#10;their victim, and others with a more generous and liberal feeling. The&#10;American Indian always deemed his moral victories the noblest, prizing&#10;the groans and yielding of his victim under torture, more than the&#10;trophy of his scalp; and the trophy itself more than his life.

The Hurons were making their way to him from different directions, intending to capture or harm him.&#10;2. To navigate this challenging situation, Deerslayer came up with a plan to run the gauntlet of a few rifles and make a desperate attempt to reach the canoe and escape. He knew that escaping through the woods was no longer an option due to the surrounding Hurons.&#10;3. Deerslayer remained calm and composed under pressure, using strategy to his advantage. By lying quiet and watching the movements of the Hurons, he gained time to plan his next move. When running from the Hurons, he chose a straight diagonal direction up the acclivity, which was toilsome enough to gain distance but not too steep to hinder his progress.&#10;4. Deerslayer knew that turning or doubling back would make escape impossible due to the greater number of pursuers who could easily overtake or outwit him. He also understood that he could outrun any single Indian pursuer, but not the entire group, which had the advantage in numbers and position.&#10;5. By employing these strategies, Deerslayer gained more than a hundred yards on even the leading men of the Hurons, buying himself time and space to execute his plan for escape." />
    <node id="The significant transformation taking place in the Delaware camp is the increasing influence of Native American customs and traditions on Deerslayer. Although he is a seasoned warrior who has adopted some Native American ways, he remains committed to his European values and beliefs. However, as the narrative progresses, Deerslayer finds himself relying more on his instincts and skills as a hunter and warrior, which are influenced by Native American customs, while still holding onto his principles of truth and honesty.&#10;&#10;This transformation causes Deerslayer to feel surprised and uneasy because he is in a critical and tantalizing situation where he must navigate the dangerous circumstances of being stranded and potentially executed by the Iroquois tribe. He knows that adopting Native American forms or customs may put him at odds with their beliefs, but he also feels justified in taking such actions for his survival and escape.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Deerslayer's shifting between white and Native American customs and feelings is a complex process influenced by various factors, including his cultural background, personal principles, and survival instincts. His ability to adapt to new circumstances while staying true to his values and beliefs highlights the complexity of his character and the challenges he faces in the Delaware camp." />

By employing these strategies, Deerslayer gained more than a hundred yards on even the leading men of the Hurons, buying himself time and space to come up with a new plan for escape. Running in a straight line made it difficult for the Hurons to surround him and forced them to spread out, giving him more room to maneuver." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Deerslayer didn't use any desperate measures with the canoe to increase his distance from his enemies or signal for help. The change in the drift of his canoe was due to a light current of air from the southwest, and his vigorous shove gave it enough momentum to continue past the end of the point. Deerslayer didn't have many options in the canoe, as it only had a large stone for ballast. Instead, he focused on evading his pursuers by employing strategic actions such as running in a straight diagonal direction up the acclivity and lying quiet to avoid detection." />
    <node id="The Hurons were motivated to torture the pale-face man, referred to as Deerslayer, due to their code of honor that required them to punish him for killing one of their warriors.

The Hurons also wanted to uphold their reputation by following through with their threat of torture and execution, even if some of them had doubts about Deerslayer's willingness to return voluntarily to face punishment. Additionally, they hoped to disgrace the Delawares by capturing one of their own and possibly forcing him to betray his people." />
    <node id="Based on the supporting materials provided, Rivenoak is a chief among the North American tribes and has risen to become the most influential leader, despite the fact that hereditary influence is not a significant factor in their politics. Instead, Rivenoak has achieved his position through the force of his talents, sagacity, and a union of great and mean qualities, as Bacon would express it. He has succeeded in gaining influence through eloquence and rendering fallacies acceptable to his listeners, which has helped him become a prominent figure in his tribe. Rivenoak is also known for being commonly found on the side of mercy in all scenes of vindictive torture and revenge in his tribe since his attainment to power. He has not inherited his position, but rather earned it through his abilities and actions, making him an influential leader among the North American tribes." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer finds himself in a critical and dangerous situation after discovering the missing canoe and the dead body of the Panther on the beach.

However, he knows that swimming would be risky as the canoe would likely be sent in chase, and his chances of success would be uncertain. He also knows that the raft is at a considerable distance on the other side of the point. Deerslayer lies quiet, trusting to his sense of hearing and waiting to see if anyone approaches by swimming. Eventually, he makes a plan to reach the canoe, run the gauntlet of a few rifles, and escape, as the warriors have left their weapons behind.

The Sumach is generally considered unpopular and acidic in nature by her tribe, but they feel obligated to uphold her honor based on their cultural customs and the significance of marriage in their society.&#10;4. The killing of her husband and brother has already stained the tribe's honor, and failing to defend Sumach against perceived insults would further harm the tribe's reputation.&#10;5. The Huron tribe defends Sumach's honor not necessarily due to personal respect for her but because they view the insult as an affront to the entire Huron nation's honor.&#10;6. The Sumach becomes enraged and violently attacks Deerslayer, blaming him for her husband and brother's deaths, despite his belief that their deaths were accidental.&#10;7. The Huron tribe is motivated to defend Sumach's honor based on their cultural values of marriage and tribal customs, rather than personal regard for her." />

In response, Deerslayer defended himself and raised a hand in self-defense, which he believes is justifiable according to the rules of war and his own principles. He argues that it would have been against nature not to defend himself in such a situation, and it would have done discredit to his training and gifts as a skilled hunter and warrior. Therefore, Deerslayer sees his actions as necessary and lawful in war, even though they may be considered unlawful in peace.">

The Hurons intend to uphold their code of honor, which requires them to torture and execute Deerslayer for his actions, unless he can redeem himself by bringing off proof of victory through the taking of a trophy, such as his captor's scalp. This is a way for the Hurons to assert their dominance over the pale-face and disgrace the Delawares, their rivals. The orator also implies that Deerslayer might have an opportunity to live among them if he can prove himself worthy of such acceptance.

A common, but low exclamation of surprise and admiration escaped&#10;every mouth, and the grim warriors looked at each other, some with envy&#10;and disappointment, some with astonishment at the precise accuracy of&#10;their victim, and others with a more generous and liberal feeling. The&#10;American Indian always deemed his moral victories the noblest, prizing&#10;the groans and yielding of his victim under torture, more than the&#10;trophy of his scalp; and the trophy itself more than his life.

    <edge source="The significant transformation taking place in the Delaware camp is the increasing influence of Native American customs and traditions on Deerslayer. Although he is a seasoned warrior who has adopted some Native American ways, he remains committed to his European values and beliefs. However, as the narrative progresses, Deerslayer finds himself relying more on his instincts and skills as a hunter and warrior, which are influenced by Native American customs, while still holding onto his principles of truth and honesty.&#10;&#10;This transformation causes Deerslayer to feel surprised and uneasy because he is in a critical and tantalizing situation where he must navigate the dangerous circumstances of being stranded and potentially executed by the Iroquois tribe. He knows that adopting Native American forms or customs may put him at odds with their beliefs, but he also feels justified in taking such actions for his survival and escape.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Deerslayer's shifting between white and Native American customs and feelings is a complex process influenced by various factors, including his cultural background, personal principles, and survival instincts. His ability to adapt to new circumstances while staying true to his values and beliefs highlights the complexity of his character and the challenges he faces in the Delaware camp." target="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer finds himself in a critical and dangerous situation after discovering the missing canoe and the dead body of the Panther on the beach. He is now certain that the Iroquois tribe intended to leave him stranded and prisoner on the narrow tongue of land, with no other means of escape but swimming. However, he knows that swimming would be risky as the canoe would likely be sent in chase, and his chances of success would be uncertain. He also knows that the raft is at a considerable distance on the other side of the point. Deerslayer lies quiet, trusting to his sense of hearing and waiting to see if anyone approaches by swimming. Eventually, he makes a plan to reach the canoe, run the gauntlet of a few rifles, and escape, as the warriors have left their weapons behind. However, he is aware that the Iroquois tribe plans to use torture and possibly execute him for his actions, so he remains committed to the truth and refuses to take part in any deception or adopt red-skin forms to avoid punishment.">

The Hurons also wanted to uphold their reputation by following through with their threat of torture and execution, even if some of them had doubts about Deerslayer's willingness to return voluntarily to face punishment.

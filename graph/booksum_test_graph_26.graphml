She duly went on with the Lord's Prayer, the&#10;children lisping it after her in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the&#10;conclusion, raising their voices to clerk's pitch, they again piped&#10;into silence, &quot;Amen!&quot;&#10;&#10;Then their sister, with much augmented confidence in the efficacy&#10;of the sacrament, poured forth from the bottom of her heart the&#10;thanksgiving that follows, uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the&#10;stopt-diapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in&#10;her speech, and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her.&#10;The ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her; it set upon her face a&#10;glowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each&#10;cheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her eye-pupils&#10;shone like a diamond.

The kindly dimness of the weak&#10;candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes&#10;which sunlight might have revealed--the stubble scratches upon her&#10;wrists, and the weariness of her eyes--her high enthusiasm having&#10;a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing,&#10;showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity&#10;which was almost regal.  The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy&#10;eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended&#10;wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to&#10;become active.&#10;&#10;The most impressed of them said:&#10;&#10;&quot;Be you really going to christen him, Tess" />

Perhaps it will be just the same!&quot;&#10;&#10;She spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have&#10;shone in the gloom surrounding her.  She lit a candle, and went to&#10;a second and a third bed under the wall, where she awoke her young&#10;sisters and brothers, all of whom occupied the same room.  Pulling&#10;out the washing-stand so that she could get behind it, she poured&#10;some water from a jug, and made them kneel around, putting their&#10;hands together with fingers exactly vertical.  While the children,&#10;scarcely awake, awe-stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger&#10;and larger, remained in this position, she took the baby from her&#10;bed--a child's child--so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient&#10;personality to endow its producer with the maternal title.

She--and how many more--might have ironically said&#10;to God with Saint Augustine: &quot;Thou hast counselled a better course&#10;than Thou hast permitted.&quot;&#10;&#10;She remained at her father's house during the winter months, plucking&#10;fowls, or cramming turkeys and geese, or making clothes for her&#10;sisters and brothers out of some finery which d'Urberville had given&#10;her, and she had put by with contempt.

The lurid presentment so powerfully&#10;affected her imagination in the silence of the sleeping house that&#10;her nightgown became damp with perspiration, and the bedstead shook&#10;with each throb of her heart.&#10;&#10;The infant's breathing grew more difficult, and the mother's mental&#10;tension increased.  It was useless to devour the little thing with&#10;kisses; she could stay in bed no longer, and walked feverishly about&#10;the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;O merciful God, have pity; have pity upon my poor baby!&quot; she cried.&#10;&quot;Heap as much anger as you want to upon me, and welcome; but pity the&#10;child!&quot;&#10;&#10;She leant against the chest of drawers, and murmured incoherent&#10;supplications for a long while, till she" />
    <node id="Tess noticed the approach of a group of children, ranging in age from six to fourteen, while she was working in the fields. Despite her initial slight flush, she continued her work and did not pause. The group included an older girl carrying an infant in long clothes, and another child bringing lunch. Tess had come out to the fields dressed neatly, appearing dignified and calm even when holding the baby, as she had been influenced by some spirit. She bore herself with dignity and looked people directly in the eye, a contrast to her usual behavior when she avoided eye contact. This change in demeanor can be attributed to Tess's desire to present herself well, as harvest-hands were in high demand at that time." />

As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might&#10;have noticed that every now and then Tess's glance flitted wistfully&#10;to the brow of the hill, though she did not pause in her sheafing.&#10;On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages&#10;ranging from six to fourteen, rose over the stubbly convexity of the&#10;hill.&#10;&#10;The face of Tess flushed slightly, but still she did not pause.&#10;&#10;The eldest of the comers, a girl who wore a triangular shawl, its&#10;corner draggling on the stubble, carried in her arms what at first&#10;sight seemed to be a doll, but proved to be an infant in long&#10;clothes.

No, she would&#10;have taken it calmly, and found pleasure therein. Most of the misery&#10;had been generated by her conventional aspect, and not by her innate&#10;sensations.&#10;&#10;Whatever Tess's reasoning, some spirit had induced her to dress&#10;herself up neatly as she had formerly done, and come out into the&#10;fields, harvest-hands being greatly in demand just then.  This was&#10;why she had borne herself with dignity, and had looked people calmly&#10;in the face at times, even when holding the baby in her arms.&#10;&#10;The harvest-men rose from the shock of corn, and stretched their&#10;limbs, and extinguished their pipes.

She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a&#10;structure of sensations, to anybody but herself.  To all humankind&#10;besides, Tess was only a passing thought.  Even to friends she was&#10;no more than a frequently passing thought.

All the women but Tess fell into animated&#10;talk, and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair.&#10;&#10;When the infant had taken its fill, the young mother sat it upright&#10;in her lap, and looking into the far distance, dandled it with a&#10;gloomy indifference that was almost dislike; then all of a sudden she&#10;fell to violently kissing it some dozens of times, as if she could&#10;never leave off, the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which&#10;strangely combined passionateness with contempt.&#10;&#10;&quot;She's fond of that there child, though she mid pretend to hate en,&#10;and say she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard,&quot;&#10;observed the woman in the red pettico" />
    <node id="Tess Durbeyfield, the protagonist in Thomas Hardy's novel &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles,&quot; has complex feelings about her knightly ancestry as she begins her job at Talbothays dairy. On one hand, Tess feels distant from her d'Urberville heritage, having been told that they were not Blakemore men and that her mother was Blakemore to the bone. She even decides that in her new life, she will be the dairymaid Tess, and nothing more, with her mother never alluding to the knightly ancestry due to Tess's feelings on the subject.&#10;&#10;However, there is also a sense of curiosity and hope within Tess about being in her ancestral land. She wonders if any strange good thing might come of her being in her forefathers' territory and entertains the idea that her individual innocence as a humble descendant could lapse as silently as d'Urberville, the family name, had fallen. This suggests that Tess may harbor some hope for social mobility or improvement through her connection to the d'Urbervilles, despite her resolve to distance herself from that past.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess experiences conflicting feelings about her knightly ancestry as she starts her job at Talbothays dairy. While she has decided to leave the past behind and be simply Tess, the dairymaid, there is also a sense of curiosity, hope, and perhaps even secret ambition associated with being in the land of her forefathers, near their former estates and vaults." />

The dairy called Talbothays,&#10;for which she was bound, stood not remotely from some of the former&#10;estates of the d'Urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her&#10;granddames and their powerful husbands.  She would be able to look at&#10;them, and think not only that d'Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen,&#10;but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse&#10;as silently.  All the while she wondered if any strange good thing&#10;might come of her being in her ancestral land; and some spirit within&#10;her rose  automatically as the sap in the twigs.  It was unexpected&#10;youth, surging up anew after its temporary check, and bringing with&#10;it hope, and the invincible instinct towards self-delight.&#10;&#10;&#10;END OF PHASE THE SECOND&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Phase the Third" />

To persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical&#10;degrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.&#10;&#10;On one point she was resolved: there should be no more d'Urberville&#10;air-castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life.

'Tis nater, after all, and what do please God!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The event of Tess Durbeyfield's return from the manor of her bogus&#10;kinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for&#10;a space of a square mile.  In the afternoon several young girls of&#10;Marlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess, called to&#10;see her, arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as&#10;became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest (as&#10;they supposed), and sat round the room looking at her with great&#10;curiosity.  For the fact that it was this said thirty-first cousin,&#10;Mr d'Urberville, who had fallen in love with her, a gentleman&#10;not altogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and&#10;heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries&#10;of Trant" />

Yet even now Tess felt the&#10;pulse of hopeful life still warm within her; she might be happy in&#10;some nook which had no memories.

After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to&#10;undertake outdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of&#10;the year in the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that&#10;she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as&#10;harvesting in the fields.&#10;&#10;The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess's,&#10;the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille&#10;at the completion of a sheaf" />

Tess felt uncomfortable there and believed that she could not be happy in a place with so many memories.&#10;&#10;She undertook a toilful journey on foot because she wanted to get away as soon as possible, and there was no other means of transportation available to her. The narrative mentions that she saw a two-wheeled vehicle driven by Alec d'Urberville, who had followed her in an attempt to understand why she left stealthily.

Occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some&#10;gate or post; and then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her&#10;full round arm, went steadily on again.&#10;&#10;It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess&#10;Durbeyfield's arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to&#10;the night ride in The Chase.  The time was not long past daybreak,&#10;and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted&#10;the ridge towards which her face was set--the barrier of the vale&#10;wherein she had of late been a stranger--which she would have to&#10;climb over to reach her birthplace.  The ascent was gradual on this&#10;side, and the soil and scenery differed much from those within&#10;Blakemore Vale.

    <node id="Tess's demeanor and behavior change significantly throughout the evening as she interacts with her visitors. Initially, she is reserved and avoids eye contact, reflecting her usual disposition. However, during the sacrament, Tess becomes more confident and radiant, gaining an almost divine aura in the eyes of her siblings. This transformation showcases her deep faith and the emotional significance of the sacrament for her.&#10;&#10;Tess's true perspective on her past experiences is revealed through her introspection while working in the fields. She recognizes that the world's concern about her situation is largely an illusion, as she is mostly a &quot;passing thought&quot; to others. Tess realizes that even if she makes herself miserable or tries to be cheerful, people would only form simple opinions about her, such as &quot;Ah, she makes herself unhappy&quot; or &quot;Ah, she bears it very well.&quot; This insight highlights Tess's growing self-awareness and her understanding that the weight of her past is primarily a burden for her to carry.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Tess's decision to leave the d'Urberville estate stealthily demonstrates her determination to escape her past and find happiness elsewhere. Despite having been a guest at the estate and potentially being able to claim kinship with the wealthy d'Urbervilles, she chooses to walk away on foot, carrying a heavy load, rather than trying to reconcile or seeking help from Alec, who follows her in a two-wheeled vehicle. Tess's actions emphasize her desire for a new beginning and her determination to move past the challenges and memories associated with her past experiences." />
    <node id="The woman, Tess, has a profound connection with solitude and nature during her evening walks, which serve as a means for her to find mental liberty. She is well-acquainted with the precise moment when light and darkness are evenly balanced, making it easier for her to avoid mankind. This specific time of day allows her to diminish the weight of being alive, as she finds comfort in nature rather than human connections. Tess perceives the world as a psychological phenomenon, and she often anthropomorphizes natural elements to intensify her experiences. The airs, gusts, midnight twigs, and winter buds all become part of her story, mirroring her emotions and feelings. This relationship with solitude and nature highlights Tess's self-reliance and the role that the natural world plays in her emotional wellbeing." />
    <node id=" least solitary.  She&#10;knew how to hit to a hair's-breadth that moment of evening when the&#10;light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of&#10;day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute&#10;mental liberty.  It is then that the plight of being alive becomes&#10;attenuated to its least possible dimensions.  She had no fear of the&#10;shadows; her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind--or rather that&#10;cold accretion called the world, which, so terrible in the mass, is&#10;so unformidable, even pitiable, in its units.&#10;&#10;On these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece&#10;with the element she moved in.  Her flexuous and stealthy figure&#10;became an integral part of the scene.  At times her whimsical fancy&#10;would intensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part&#10;of her own story.

    <node id=".  The&#10;midnight airs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly-wrapped buds and&#10;bark of the winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach.  A wet&#10;day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the&#10;mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely&#10;as the God of her childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.&#10;&#10;But this encompassment of her own characterization, based on shreds&#10;of convention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her,&#10;was a sorry and mistaken creation of Tess's fancy--a cloud of moral&#10;hobgoblins by which she was terrified without reason.  It was they&#10;that were out of harmony with the actual world, not she.  Walking&#10;among the sleeping birds in the hedges, watching the skipping rabbits&#10;on a moonlit warren, or standing under a pheasant-laden bough, she&#10;looked upon herself as a figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts&#10;of Innocence.  But all the while she was making a distinction where&#10;there was no difference.  Feeling herself in antagonism, she was&#10;quite in accord." />
    <node id="Τess's attempt to speak with the new parish parson in the evening after dusk can be understood as an effort to ensure a proper Christian burial for her child. Since she couldn't bring herself to go to his house and approach him directly, she waited outside his gate, hoping to gather the courage to talk to him. When she accidentally met him on his way home, she took it as an opportunity to ask about the requirements for a Christian burial, particularly given that her baby had not been baptized.&#10;&#10;Tess is concerned about her child's eternal rest and wants to make sure that her baby will be accepted in consecrated ground. She has been contemplating the significance of her child's impending death, knowing that her baby would not receive salvation without being baptized. Her Catholic upbringing might have emphasized the importance of a proper burial for her child's soul, making it crucial for Tess to seek out the parson and ask about the necessary steps.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, she is unable to meet with him due to her father's objections, which stem from his sense of family nobility and shame over Tess's pregnancy. This leaves Tess distraught, knowing that she cannot provide a proper Christian burial for her dying child." />

She went to his house after dusk,&#10;and stood by the gate, but could not summon courage to go in.  The&#10;enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met&#10;him coming homeward as she turned away.  In the gloom she did not&#10;mind speaking" />

Somewhat moved, he said in&#10;this case also--&#10;&#10;&quot;It will be just the same.&quot;&#10;&#10;So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman's&#10;shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light,&#10;at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that&#10;shabby corner of God's allotment where He lets the nettles grow,&#10;and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides,&#10;and others of the conjecturally damned are laid.

    <node id=" that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the&#10;flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured.&#10;And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which&#10;transcended that of the child's simple loss.  Her baby had not been&#10;baptized.&#10;&#10;Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the&#10;consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done,&#10;burn she must, and there was an end of it.  Like all village girls,&#10;she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully&#10;studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences&#10;to be drawn therefrom.  But when the same question arose with regard&#10;to the baby, it had a very different colour.  Her darling was about&#10;to die, and no salvation.&#10;&#10;It was nearly bedtime, but she rushed downstairs and asked if she&#10;might send for the parson.  The moment happened to be one at which&#10;her father's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest,&#10;and his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that&#10;nobility" />
    <node id="her father's sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest,&#10;and his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that&#10;nobility most pronounced, for he had just returned from his weekly&#10;booze at Rolliver's Inn.  No parson should come inside his door, he&#10;declared, prying into his affairs, just then, when, by her shame, it&#10;had become more necessary than ever to hide them.  He locked the door&#10;and put the key in his pocket.&#10;&#10;The household went to bed, and, distressed beyond measure, Tess&#10;retired also.  She was continually waking as she lay, and in the&#10;middle of the night found that the baby was still worse.  It was&#10;obviously dying--quietly and painlessly, but none the less surely.&#10;&#10;In her misery she rocked herself upon the bed.  The clock struck the&#10;solemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and&#10;malignant possibilities stand rock-firm as facts.  She thought of&#10;the child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell, as its double&#10;doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy; saw the arch" />
    <node id="The mother's intense fear and anxiety in the middle of the night are primarily caused by her concerns about her baby's spiritual fate after death. She is worried that her child, who has not been baptized, might be condemned to hell due to its double doom - lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy. This fear is so powerful that it affects her physically, making her nightgown damp with perspiration and causing the bedstead to shake with each throb of her heart.&#10;&#10;Her concern for her baby's well-being goes beyond his physical state; she is deeply troubled by the prospect of his eternal rest and wants to ensure that he will be accepted in consecrated ground. This concern stems from her Catholic upbringing, which might have emphasized the importance of a proper burial for her child's soul. Unfortunately, she is unable to meet with the parish parson due to her father's objections, which adds to her distress and feeling of helplessness." />
    <node id="The sister, Tess, undergoes a significant transformation in demeanor after she finishes pouring forth her thanksgiving during the sacrament. She becomes more confident and radiant, gaining an almost divine aura in the eyes of her siblings. This transformation is a result of her deep faith and the emotional significance of the sacrament for her. Her face glows with irradiation, and her eyes shine like diamonds, causing the children to gaze up at her with reverence. They no longer see her as just their sister but as a figure of immaculate beauty and dignity, no longer wishing to disturb her. The change in Tess's demeanor emphasizes her strong faith and the emotional impact of the sacrament on her spiritual journey." />
    <node id="Tess, the main character, is working in the fields when a group of children, ranging in age from six to fourteen, appear on the hill. Despite her initial blush, Tess continues working and does not pause. The group includes an older girl carrying an infant, and another child bringing lunch. Tess had come out to the fields dressed neatly and presents herself with dignity and calmness, making eye contact with people, which is a contrast to her usual behavior. This change in demeanor can be attributed to Tess's desire to present herself well, as harvest-hands were in high demand at that time. The children come to break for breakfast and return to work, and Tess steals glances towards the hill, where they appeared. When the infant in her care is hungry, Tess nurses it, and the men and women working in the field turn away out of consideration. After feeding the infant, Tess holds it with a &quot;gloomy indifference&quot; before violently kissing it, showing a mix of passion and contempt. The actions of Tess suggest that she has a strong emotional connection to the child, but also feels some level of resentment towards her role as a mother." />
    <node id="The significant action Tess Durbeyfield takes after declining the offer of ale and calling up her sister to take the baby is that she begins to breastfeed the infant. This is implied when it says &quot;Tess, with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still rising colour, unfastened her frock&quot; - this suggests that she is revealing her breast to nurse the child. The fact that she chooses to do this instead of drinking alcohol shows her responsibility and selflessness as a mother, as well as her determination to take care of her child despite their difficult circumstances." />

Here&#10;they fell to, the men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a&#10;cup.&#10;&#10;Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours.&#10;She sat down at the end of the shock, her face turned somewhat away&#10;from her companions.  When she had deposited herself a man in a&#10;rabbit-skin cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt,&#10;held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink.  But&#10;she did not accept his offer.  As soon as her lunch was spread she&#10;called up the big girl, her sister, and took the baby of her, who,&#10;glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to the next shock and&#10;joined the other children playing there.

She suddenly thought&#10;one afternoon, when looking in the glass at her fairness, that there&#10;was yet another date, of greater importance to her than those; that&#10;of her own death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day&#10;which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving&#10;no sign or sound when she annually passed over it; but not the less&#10;surely there.  When was it?  Why did she not feel the chill of each&#10;yearly encounter with such a cold relation?  She had Jeremy Taylor's&#10;thought that some time in the future those who had known her would&#10;say: &quot;It is the ----th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died&quot;; and&#10;there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement.

    <node id="The question asks about the new opportunity for departure that is presented to Tess in early May through a letter from a former friend. The narrative does not provide explicit details about the contents of the letter or how it facilitates Tess's escape. However, considering Tess's strong desire to leave her past behind and start anew, this letter likely brought her a chance for a fresh start, possibly by offering employment, lodging, or other means of support in a new location. This opportunity encourages Tess to make the decision of leaving her home and family to work at Talbothays dairy, where she eventually meets Angel Clare. Ultimately, this letter represents a turning point for Tess as it materializes an otherwise uncertain path toward a new life, contributing to her pursuit of happiness and escape from her past." />
    <node id="Tess Durbeyfield decided to take up outdoor work during the busiest agricultural season because it was more remunerative than any indoor tasks she could do at home. As a newly single mother and the primary breadwinner for her family, Tess needed to maximize her income.&#10;&#10;In terms of her appearance and demeanor, Tess differs from other country-bred girls in several ways. Firstly, she has an oval face with deep-set dark eyes, contrasting with the usual fair complexion and light eyes common among country girls. Her long, heavy tresses are also unique, as they appear darker and thicker than those of her peers. Additionally, Tess's physical features, such as paler cheeks, regular teeth, and thinner red lips, contribute to her distinctive appearance.&#10;&#10;Regarding demeanor, Tess conducts herself with more dignity and self-assurance compared to other country girls. When she first arrives at the harvest fields, she takes time to compose herself by adjusting her clothing and bonnet, suggesting a greater awareness of her appearance and social standing. Furthermore, when working in the fields, Tess maintains her composure even when interrupted by a group of children, exhibiting a calm and dignified demeanor that sets her apart from her peers." />
    <node id="The young girl, Tess, initially felt attracted to Alec d'Urberville, but she later despised and disliked him because he took advantage of her helplessness and tried to manipulate her into marriage. She had been away from home for four months and was not aware of the dangers that men could pose. Tess expresses her frustration to her mother, saying that if she had known about these dangers, she would have been more cautious. Furthermore, Tess had not wholly cared for Alec; she had only temporarily surrendered to his advances due to his persistent courtship. However, she later realized that she did not love him and even despised him.&#10;&#10;Tess felt unprepared for the dangers of men-folk because she was naive and innocent, having been raised in a sheltered environment. She had not read novels or received any formal education about these matters, which made her vulnerable to Alec's manipulations. Additionally, Tess's mother did not warn her about the dangers of men, instead encouraging her to marry Alec for financial gain. This lack of guidance and protection from her mother left Tess feeling vulnerable and unprepared for the challenges she faced with Alec." />

She had&#10;never wholly cared for him; she did not at all care for him now.  She&#10;had dreaded him, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages&#10;he took of her helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent&#10;manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly&#10;despised and disliked him, and had run away.

    <node id="The argument between Tess and Alec d'Urberville was sparked by a comment he made that demonstrated his generalization about women, implying that they all react similarly without regard for their individual experiences or perspectives. This angered Tess, leading her to threaten him, causing the man to apologize.&#10;&#10;Alec had used words that Tess found objectionable when he suggested that she should get him to marry her, despite his never having mentioned marriage before. He made this comment without considering Tess's feelings or individual circumstances. Upon realizing that his words and actions had upset Tess, Alec expressed regret for his behavior.&#10;&#10;The immediate circumstance leading up to the argument was Alec's reluctance to let Tess go, even though she had made it clear that she did not love him. He still harbored feelings for her due to her beauty and the fascination her supposed position as his lover brought upon others. This led to an exchange where Alec suggested marriage, which upset Tess and sparked their argument.&#10;&#10;In summary, the argument between Tess and Alec arose from his thoughtless words and actions, which did not take into account her feelings or individual experiences. The man later expressed regret for his behavior after realizing that his words had upset Tess." />
    <node id="1. Tess slipped away stealthily and chose to toil on foot instead of using the two-wheeled vehicle offered by Alec d'Urberville because she was determined to leave her past behind and find happiness elsewhere. She wanted to escape the memories associated with the d'Urberville estate and the uncomfortable situation she found herself in there.&#10;2. Tess did not want to be hindered from going since she felt that staying at the d'Urberville estate would prevent her from moving forward and finding true happiness. By leaving on foot, she demonstrated her resolve to leave behind her past and make a fresh start.&#10;3. Additionally, accepting Alec's offer might imply that Tess was open to continuing their relationship or allowing him to maintain some control over her life, which contradicted her desire for independence and separation from the d'Urberville family." />
    <node id="The children's perception of Sissy (Tess) changes dramatically after her emotional transformation during the sacrament. They begin to see her as a divine, immaculate figure, gazing up at her with reverence and a sense of awe. This shift in their perspective highlights Tess's strong faith and the powerful impact of the sacrament on her demeanor.&#10;&#10;In response to the death of Poor Sorrow (the infant), the children cry bitterly but eventually come to terms with his loss. Tess, on the other hand, feels a sense of calmness and acceptance about the situation. She reflects on her previous fears for the child's soul and realizes that even if he wasn't baptized, she doesn't value the kind of heaven lost by the irregularity. This attitude demonstrates Tess's growth in faith and her understanding that her child's eternal rest is ultimately in the hands of Providence." />

In the blue of the morning that fragile&#10;soldier and servant breathed his last, and when the other children&#10;awoke they cried bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty&#10;baby.&#10;&#10;The calmness which had possessed Tess since the christening remained&#10;with her in the infant's loss.  In the daylight, indeed, she felt her&#10;terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether&#10;well founded or not, she had no uneasiness now, reasoning that&#10;if Providence would not ratify such an act of approximation&#10;she, for one, did not value the kind of heaven lost by the&#10;irregularity--either for herself or for her child" />
    <node id="In the early morning scene near Marlott village, a young man's light breaks through chinks of cottage shutters and illuminates the interior of the houses with stripes of red-hot pokers. This light serves to awaken harvesters who were not already stirring. The most striking details in the cornfield during this time are the reaping-machine's broad arms of painted wood, which form the revolving Maltese cross of the machine. These arms have been smeared with paint that intensifies in hue when exposed to sunlight, giving them the appearance of having been dipped in liquid fire. The field has already been &quot;opened&quot; for the horses and machine to pass through, creating a lane a few feet wide along the entire circumference of the field." />

They, with two others below, formed the&#10;revolving Maltese cross of the reaping-machine, which had been&#10;brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for&#10;operations this day.  The paint with which they were smeared,&#10;intensified in hue by the sunlight, imparted to them a look of&#10;having been dipped in liquid fire.&#10;&#10;The field had already been &quot;opened&quot;; that is to say, a lane a few&#10;feet wide had been hand-cut through the wheat along the whole&#10;circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and&#10;machine.&#10;&#10;Two" />

A field-man is a&#10;personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field; she had&#10;somehow lost her own margin, imbibed the essence of her surrounding,&#10;and assimilated herself with it.&#10;&#10;The women--or rather girls, for they were mostly young--wore drawn&#10;cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun," />

He did this in a business-like manner, placing a comma after each word and emphasizing them as if to drive the words deep into the reader's heart. The message appeared stark and defaced against the peaceful landscape, but it entered Tess's mind with accusatory horror, making her feel as though the man knew about her recent history." />

They seemed to shout&#10;themselves out and make the atmosphere ring.

This morning the&#10;eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she&#10;being the most flexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all.  But&#10;her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is&#10;disclosed while she binds, though her complexion may be guessed from&#10;a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the&#10;curtain of her bonnet.  Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual&#10;attention is that she never courts it, though the other women often&#10;gaze around them." />
    <node id="The sister, Tess, undergoes a significant transformation in demeanor as she leads her siblings in post-communion prayers. She becomes more confident and radiant, gaining an almost divine aura in the eyes of her siblings. This transformation is due to her deep faith and the emotional significance of the sacrament for her. Her face glows with irradiation, and her eyes shine like diamonds, causing the children to gaze up at her with reverence. They no longer see her as just their sister but as a figure of immaculate beauty and dignity, no longer wishing to disturb her. The change in Tess's demeanor emphasizes her strong faith and the powerful impact of the sacrament on her spiritual journey." />
    <node id="Tess, the solitary woman, skillfully navigates the balance between light and darkness by choosing to walk during the evenly balanced moment when light and darkness are equal. This allows her to find mental liberty and avoid human connections, which she sees as a cold and unformidable &quot;world&quot; when viewed in its entirety but finds pitiable in individuals. Tess perceives the world as a psychological phenomenon, often anthropomorphizing natural elements to reflect her emotions and feelings. She considers herself an anomaly, yet she has only violated a social convention, not a law inherent to her environment. While on lonely hills and dales, Tess experiences a strong connection with nature, finding comfort in its familiarity during her moments of grief and pain." />
    <node id=".  But all the while she was making a distinction where&#10;there was no difference.  Feeling herself in antagonism, she was&#10;quite in accord.  She had been made to break an accepted social law,&#10;but no law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such&#10;an anomaly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was a hazy sunrise in August.  The denser nocturnal vapours,&#10;attacked by the warm beams, were dividing and shrinking into isolated&#10;fleeces within hollows and coverts, where they waited till they&#10;should be dried away to nothing.&#10;&#10;The sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal&#10;look, demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression.&#10;His present aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the&#10;scene, explained the old-time heliolatries in a moment.  One could&#10;feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky.  The&#10;luminary was a golden-haired, beaming, mild-eyed, God-like creature,&#10;gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that&#10;was brimming with interest for him.&#10;&#10;His light, a" />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide the exact date of Tess Durbeyfield's death. This is because Tess herself contemplates her own death in a philosophical manner, realizing that it will be just another day among the days of the year with no particular sign or sound to mark its significance. It is only after she has passed away that people might say, &quot;It is the --th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died,&quot; without any singularity in their minds." />
    <node id="Tess does not return Alec's kisses or admit to loving him because she genuinely does not have feelings for him. Although she initially felt attracted to him, his actions of taking advantage of her vulnerability and trying to manipulate her into marriage caused her to despise and dislike him. She recognizes that marrying him would not be for love but out of a sense of obligation or convenience, which she rejects. Tess values honesty and has honor, as seen when she says that lying about her feelings would do the most good but that she cannot bring herself to do it. Additionally, Tess's naivete and lack of formal education about romantic relationships make her more vulnerable to Alec's advances, but they also contribute to her inability to pretend to have feelings for him as a means of gaining some comfort." />

You never willingly&#10;do that--you'll never love me, I fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have said so, often.  It is true.  I have never really and truly&#10;loved you, and I think I never can.&quot;  She added mournfully, &quot;Perhaps,&#10;of all things, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now;&#10;but I have honour enough" />
    <node id="Tess's lack of interest in attending a charity sermon is due to her disbelief in the commandment &quot;Thou, shalt, not, commit--&quot; which she sees Alec's brush inscribed with. This commandment, likely referring to &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery,&quot; does not interest or move Tess, possibly because she has already violated it with Alec.&#10;&#10;Tess contemptuously questions if God said such things as she gazes at her family's chimney and interior because she is grappling with the consequences of her actions. Her baby, who is about to die, has not been baptized, and Tess feels the weight of this fact heavily. She had accepted that she might have to &quot;burn&quot; for what she did, but when it comes to her baby's salvation, she feels a profound sense of despair. This leads her to question the very relevance and applicability of the teachings she grew up with, as represented by the commandment on Alec's brush." />

I'm&#10;not of his persuasion now, but he's a good man, and he'll expound as&#10;well as any parson I know.  'Twas he began the work in me.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Tess did not answer; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes&#10;fixed on the ground.  &quot;Pooh--I don't believe God said such things!&quot;&#10;she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away.&#10;&#10;A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney, the&#10;sight of which made her heart ache.  The aspect of the interior, when&#10;she reached it, made her heart ache more.  Her mother, who had just&#10;come down stairs, turned to greet her from the fireplace, where she" />

She undertook a long and arduous journey on foot, carrying a heavy load, as she was determined to find happiness elsewhere and escape the memories associated with the place. This decision demonstrated her resolve to leave behind her past and make a fresh start, independent of the d'Urberville family.&#10;&#10;During her travels, Tess spent her time reflecting on her decisions and their consequences. She recognized that the world's concern about her situation was largely an illusion, as she was mostly a &quot;passing thought&quot; to others. This insight highlighted Tess's growing self-awareness and her understanding that the weight of her past was primarily a burden for her to carry.&#10;&#10;Tess also experienced a transformation in her demeanor during the sacrament at her family home, becoming more confident and radiant, gaining an almost divine aura in the eyes of her siblings. This change showcased her deep faith and the emotional significance of the sacrament for her.&#10;&#10;Overall, Tess moved forward after leaving the d'Urberville estate by reflecting on her decisions, acknowledging the weight of her past, and demonstrating determination to find happiness elsewhere." />
    <node id="The girl, Sissy (Tess), meets a man accidentally while she is emotionally distressed and seeking advice. Her baby is sick and she has performed an improvised sacrament out of desperation, hoping it would save her child's soul. She approaches the man, who is a parish parson, to ask if this makeshift ritual will have the same effect as if he had conducted it himself.&#10;&#10;The man, having natural feelings of a tradesman wanting to do the job right and being initially dismissive of the situation, grapples with an internal struggle between his technical belief and actual scepticism. The girl's dignity and tender voice affect his nobler impulses, which have been shaped by ten years of trying to reconcile religious beliefs with his own scepticism.&#10;&#10;As a result, he responds with compassion, putting aside his doubts and telling Tess that it will be just the same. This decision highlights the man's human side, as he allows his nobler instincts to guide him in this instance, despite his personal reservations about religious doctrine." />
    <node id="Tess's change in demeanor and passive behavior beside Alec d'Urberville can be attributed to her acceptance of the situation and her lack of fear. After deciding to leave her past behind, she no longer feels threatened or intimidated by him. Additionally, the power dynamic between them has shifted as Tess is no longer in a position where she needs to rely on Alec. She places her basket and bundle in his dog-cart and sits beside him willingly, responding to his remarks in monosyllables. This change signifies Tess's determination to move forward and find happiness elsewhere, independent of the d'Urberville family and their influence on her life." />

Well, then, put up your basket,&#10;and let me help you on.&quot;&#10;&#10;She listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and&#10;stepped up, and they sat side by side.  She had no fear of him now,&#10;and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.&#10;&#10;D'Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued&#10;with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by&#10;the wayside.  He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when,&#10;in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along&#10;the same road.

Tess realizes that even if she makes herself miserable or tries to be cheerful, people would only form simple opinions about her, such as &quot;Ah, she makes herself unhappy&quot; or &quot;Ah, she bears it very well.&quot; This insight highlights Tess's growing self-awareness and her understanding that the weight of her past is primarily a burden for her to carry.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Tess's decision to leave the d'Urberville estate stealthily demonstrates her determination to escape her past and find happiness elsewhere. Despite having been a guest at the estate and potentially being able to claim kinship with the wealthy d'Urbervilles, she chooses to walk away on foot, carrying a heavy load, rather than trying to reconcile or seeking help from Alec, who follows her in a two-wheeled vehicle.

Initially, she is reserved and avoids eye contact, reflecting her usual disposition. However, during the sacrament, Tess becomes more confident and radiant, gaining an almost divine aura in the eyes of her siblings. This transformation showcases her deep faith and the emotional significance of the sacrament for her.&#10;&#10;Tess's true perspective on her past experiences is revealed through her introspection while working in the fields. She recognizes that the world's concern about her situation is largely an illusion, as she is mostly a &quot;passing thought&quot; to others. Tess realizes that even if she makes herself miserable or tries to be cheerful, people would only form simple opinions about her, such as &quot;Ah, she makes herself unhappy&quot; or &quot;Ah, she bears it very well.&quot; This insight highlights Tess's growing self-awareness and her understanding that the weight of her past is primarily a burden for her to carry.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Tess's decision to leave the d'Urberville estate stealthily demonstrates her determination to escape her past and find happiness elsewhere. Despite having been a guest at the estate and potentially being able to claim kinship with the wealthy d'Urbervilles, she chooses to walk away on foot, carrying a heavy load, rather than trying to reconcile or seeking help from Alec, who follows her in a two-wheeled vehicle.

Tess had come out to the fields dressed neatly and presents herself with dignity and calmness, making eye contact with people, which is a contrast to her usual behavior. This change in demeanor can be attributed to Tess's desire to present herself well, as harvest-hands were in high demand at that time. The children come to break for breakfast and return to work, and Tess steals glances towards the hill, where they appeared. When the infant in her care is hungry, Tess nurses it, and the men and women working in the field turn away out of consideration. After feeding the infant, Tess holds it with a &quot;gloomy indifference&quot; before violently kissing it, showing a mix of passion and contempt.

Firstly, she has an oval face with deep-set dark eyes, contrasting with the usual fair complexion and light eyes common among country girls. Her long, heavy tresses are also unique, as they appear darker and thicker than those of her peers. Additionally, Tess's physical features, such as paler cheeks, regular teeth, and thinner red lips, contribute to her distinctive appearance.&#10;&#10;Regarding demeanor, Tess conducts herself with more dignity and self-assurance compared to other country girls. When she first arrives at the harvest fields, she takes time to compose herself by adjusting her clothing and bonnet, suggesting a greater awareness of her appearance and social standing. Furthermore, when working in the fields, Tess maintains her composure even when interrupted by a group of children, exhibiting a calm and dignified demeanor that sets her apart from her peers.">

This decision highlights the man's human side, as he allows his nobler instincts to guide him in this instance, despite his personal reservations about religious doctrine.">

Tess had come out to the fields dressed neatly and presents herself with dignity and calmness, making eye contact with people, which is a contrast to her usual behavior. This change in demeanor can be attributed to Tess's desire to present herself well, as harvest-hands were in high demand at that time. The children come to break for breakfast and return to work, and Tess steals glances towards the hill, where they appeared. When the infant in her care is hungry, Tess nurses it, and the men and women working in the field turn away out of consideration. After feeding the infant, Tess holds it with a &quot;gloomy indifference&quot; before violently kissing it, showing a mix of passion and contempt. The actions of Tess suggest that she has a strong emotional connection to the child, but also feels some level of resentment towards her role as a mother." target="In the early morning scene near Marlott village, a young man's light breaks through chinks of cottage shutters and illuminates the interior of the houses with stripes of red-hot pokers.

    <edge source="Tess's lack of interest in attending a charity sermon is due to her disbelief in the commandment &quot;Thou, shalt, not, commit--&quot; which she sees Alec's brush inscribed with. This commandment, likely referring to &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery,&quot; does not interest or move Tess, possibly because she has already violated it with Alec.&#10;&#10;Tess contemptuously questions if God said such things as she gazes at her family's chimney and interior because she is grappling with the consequences of her actions. Her baby, who is about to die, has not been baptized, and Tess feels the weight of this fact heavily. She had accepted that she might have to &quot;burn&quot; for what she did, but when it comes to her baby's salvation, she feels a profound sense of despair. This leads her to question the very relevance and applicability of the teachings she grew up with, as represented by the commandment on Alec's brush." target=" inscription he was now halfway through--&#10;&#10;&#10;      THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT--&#10;&#10;&#10;Her cheerful friend saw her looking, stopped his brush, and shouted--&#10;&#10;&quot;If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment,&#10;there's a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon&#10;to-day in the parish you are going to--Mr Clare of Emminster.  I'm&#10;not of his persuasion now, but he's a good man, and he'll expound as&#10;well as any parson I know.  'Twas he began the work in me.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Tess did not answer; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes&#10;fixed on the ground.  &quot;Pooh--I don't believe God said such things!&quot;&#10;she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away.&#10;&#10;A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney, the&#10;sight of which made her heart ache.  The aspect of the interior, when&#10;she reached it, made her heart ache more.  Her mother, who had just&#10;come down stairs, turned to greet her from the fireplace, where she">

Her baby is sick and she has performed an improvised sacrament out of desperation, hoping it would save her child's soul. She approaches the man, who is a parish parson, to ask if this makeshift ritual will have the same effect as if he had conducted it himself.&#10;&#10;The man, having natural feelings of a tradesman wanting to do the job right and being initially dismissive of the situation, grapples with an internal struggle between his technical belief and actual scepticism. The girl's dignity and tender voice affect his nobler impulses, which have been shaped by ten years of trying to reconcile religious beliefs with his own scepticism.&#10;&#10;As a result, he responds with compassion, putting aside his doubts and telling Tess that it will be just the same. This decision highlights the man's human side, as he allows his nobler instincts to guide him in this instance, despite his personal reservations about religious doctrine.">

    <edge source="Tess's change in demeanor and passive behavior beside Alec d'Urberville can be attributed to her acceptance of the situation and her lack of fear. After deciding to leave her past behind, she no longer feels threatened or intimidated by him. Additionally, the power dynamic between them has shifted as Tess is no longer in a position where she needs to rely on Alec. She places her basket and bundle in his dog-cart and sits beside him willingly, responding to his remarks in monosyllables. This change signifies Tess's determination to move forward and find happiness elsewhere, independent of the d'Urberville family and their influence on her life." target=" has been for you to toil along on foot, and&#10;encumber yourself with this heavy load!

Well, then, put up your basket,&#10;and let me help you on.&quot;&#10;&#10;She listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and&#10;stepped up, and they sat side by side.  She had no fear of him now,&#10;and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.&#10;&#10;D'Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued&#10;with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by&#10;the wayside.  He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when,&#10;in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along&#10;the same road.

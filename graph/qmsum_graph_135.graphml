    <node id="1. The team is discussing the idea of offering alternate packages with different color schemes to give customers more options when purchasing the product. These alternate packages would be available for an additional cost. (Project Manager, Marketing)&#10;2. Another proposal is to design a remote control with various features that cater to different groups of people. However, there is a concern about the cost-effectiveness of designing and producing multiple types of remotes. (Project Manager, User Interface, Industrial Designer)&#10;3. The team is also considering offering functional cosmetic changes for the remote control, such as larger buttons or buttons that light up. These features would be decided based on research into what users want. (User Interface, Project Manager, Marketing)&#10;4. Lastly, they are discussing target groups and how to address their needs. One suggestion is using different colors and shapes to appeal to children. (Project Manager, User Interface, Industrial Designer, Marketing)" />

    <node id="1. Different shapes and sizes for target groups: The team discussed the possibility of using different shapes, colors, and sizes for buttons to cater to different user groups, such as children or elderly users with arthritic hands. This can be done without significantly increasing costs by strategically designing and adding features only for specific subgroups.&#10;2. Clear text and tactile sense: The team recognized the importance of clear text on buttons to avoid ambiguities and improve usability. They also considered developing a tactile sense of the remote's layout, which would help users find and operate the buttons more easily.&#10;3. Leveraging existing integrated circuits: When discussing the addition of a clock feature, the Industrial Designer mentioned that they already have an integrated circuit that could potentially accommodate this feature. This implies that adding new features may be possible without incurring additional costs by utilizing existing resources and technology.&#10;4. Collaboration between technical and marketing teams: The Marketing team is involved in the discussion and aware of cost constraints. They work together with the technical team (Industrial Designer, User Interface, Project Manager) to ensure that user needs are met while respecting budget limitations. This collaboration allows for a balanced approach to designing a remote control that caters to various user groups without exceeding cost constraints." />

    <node id="Based on the discussion transcripts, it seems that the team is leaning towards designing one remote control with various features and options to cater to different user groups. This approach would be more cost-effective than creating three separate remotes, as it would reduce production, distribution, and inventory costs. By incorporating features such as different shapes, clear text, tactile sense, and leveraging existing integrated circuits, the team can create a remote control that caters to various user groups without significantly increasing costs. Additionally, offering alternate packages with different color schemes for an additional cost can provide customers more options while generating extra revenue." />
    <node id="1. Different shapes for buttons: The Industrial Designer suggested using different shapes for buttons to cater to different user groups, such as having a triangle for volume and a square for changing channels. This idea aims to help users develop a tactile sense of the remote's layout. Marketing also recognized the value of a well-designed, tactile remote control interface.&#10;2. Larger buttons or buttons that light up: The Project Manager suggested making some buttons larger or adding lighting features to improve usability, particularly for children or elderly users with arthritic hands. Although not explicitly mentioned by marketing in this transcript, their mention of people learning button layouts by feel implies that they recognize the value of a well-designed, tactile remote control interface.&#10;3. Clear text on buttons: The Industrial Designer mentioned that clear text on buttons is essential to avoid ambiguities and ensure users can easily identify the functions of each button. Marketing also acknowledged this point, understanding the importance of clear labeling for user comprehension.&#10;4. Avoiding unintended actions: The Project Manager emphasized the importance of designing buttons to prevent unintentional actions, such as accidentally changing modes instead of selecting a favorite channel. This concern was not directly addressed by either Marketing or User Interface during these discussions; however, they may share this objective in wanting to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience.&#10;5. Light-emitting text or buttons: The Industrial Designer suggested making the text or buttons on the remote controller light emitting, so that users can find the remote in the dark. While not explicitly mentioned by Marketing or User Interface regarding the number of buttons, they would likely appreciate this feature as it contributes to overall usability and user satisfaction.&#10;&#10;Overall, there does not appear to be any significant disagreement between the Industrial Designer, Marketing, and User Interface regarding the number of buttons on a remote controller and how they should perform specific operations. Instead, their discussions focus on various aspects of improving the user experience, including tactile design, clear labeling, and light-emitting features." />
    <node id="1. Complexity concerns: The marketing, project manager, industrial designer, and user interface teams believe that expanding the remote's control capabilities beyond the TV would make the task too complex in terms of design, production, and potential user experience issues.&#10;2. Time to market: They are also concerned about the impact on the product's time-to-market if they include additional controls for other devices. This may indicate that they prioritize getting the remote control to market quickly over adding more features.&#10;3. Corporate image maintenance: The teams want to ensure that the corporate image, color, and design are consistently applied to the product, making it easily identifiable as a product of the company and avoiding any potential confusion or mistaken identity with other similar remotes." />

    <node id="Based on the transcripts provided, the Industrial Designer has mentioned that they already have an integrated circuit which could potentially accommodate a clock feature without incurring additional costs. The Project Manager does not explicitly express their thoughts on this matter in the context given; however, they do emphasize considering budget constraints when discussing other potential additions or changes to the remote control design. Therefore, if adding a clock function can be achieved within the existing budget by utilizing the available integrated circuit, it is likely that both the Industrial Designer and Project Manager would be agreeable to this idea." />
    <node id="1. The main purpose of a remote controller for a television is to control the TV's functions from a distance using signals like infrared light or radio waves. This allows users to change channels, adjust volume, and perform other actions without having to physically interact with the TV. Necessary features for a remote controller include:&#10;   a. A power on/off button to control the TV's state.&#10;   b. Buttons for changing channels and adjusting volume.&#10;   c. Signal transmission (infrared light, radio waves, or LED) to interact with the TV.&#10;   d. A timer may be useful for setting viewing duration limits or scheduling power on/off times. The need for a timer is dependent on user preferences and specific use cases.&#10;&#10;Regarding signal types, infrared light, radio waves, or LED are common methods used in remote controllers to transmit signals to the TV. The choice of signal type may depend on factors such as range, cost, and compatibility with the TV.&#10;&#10;As for the timer feature, its necessity is dependent on user preferences and specific use cases. For example, parents might find a timer useful to set viewing duration limits for their children, or users might appreciate scheduling power on/off times to conserve energy and reduce standby power consumption." />
    <node id="1. The Project Manager is open to the idea of designing a remote control with different shapes and buttons for various user groups, as this can help cater to diverse preferences and needs without significantly increasing production costs. However, they need to review the budget before making a final decision. They recognize the potential benefits of such an approach in terms of meeting user needs and supporting marketing efforts." />
    <node id="1. Integrated Circuit (IC): This component serves as the brain of the remote controller, processing user inputs and generating appropriate control signals. It interprets the button presses and converts them into digital data.&#10;2. Power Source: A battery powers the remote controller, providing the necessary electricity for all components to function. The power source enables the IC and other elements to operate, ensuring that the remote can transmit infrared (IR) signals when buttons are pressed.&#10;3. Buttons: These switches allow users to interact with the remote controller. When a button is pressed, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, indicating which function or command should be executed. Each button has a unique internal configuration that helps the IC identify and process the input correctly.&#10;4. Infrared (IR) LED: This component transmits IR signals from the remote controller to the device it controls, such as a TV. When the IC generates an infrared signal based on user input, the IR LED emits this light. The TV's IR receiver then detects the signal and triggers the corresponding action (e.g., changing channels or adjusting volume).&#10;5. Wiring: Wiring connects all components within the remote controller, allowing electrical signals to flow between them. This ensures that button presses are correctly interpreted by the IC, which in turn generates appropriate IR signals for transmission via the IR LED.&#10;&#10;Together, these components work together to allow users to control devices from a distance using IR signals. When a button is pressed on the remote controller, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, which processes this input and generates an IR signal for the IR LED to transmit. The device's IR receiver then detects this signal, triggering the desired action." />
    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer is discussing the working design of a remote controller with various features and cosmetic changes. They propose having a light-emitting text or buttons on the remote that can be found in the dark, using infrared bulbs for better visibility in dark environments, integrating a chip that functions as the brain of the remote controller, and wiring connecting all chips. They also suggest visiting an inspiring website to gather new ideas or design inspiration.&#10;&#10;2. During the presentation, the Industrial Designer mentioned some specific design elements such as:&#10;   - Light-emitting text or buttons: This feature would make it easier for users to find the remote in the dark.&#10;   - A beep when multiple buttons are pressed: This would help notify users if a child is playing with the remote and pressing buttons randomly.&#10;   - Adding a clock feature: The Industrial Designer indicated that they already have an integrated circuit which could potentially accommodate this feature without incurring additional costs.&#10;   - Automatic light when the TV is on: The remote controller would automatically have a light when the TV is on, making it easier for users to find if they misplaced it.&#10;   - Different shapes for target groups: This idea involves using different colors and shapes to appeal to children or other specific user groups.&#10;   - Bulbs in the remote controller: This feature would make the remote easier to locate when the TV is on, even if the user has misplaced it.&#10;&#10;These features aim to improve the usability and functionality of the remote controller while considering various user needs and preferences." />

Integrated Circuit (IC): This component serves as the brain of the remote controller, processing user inputs and generating appropriate control signals. It interprets the button presses and converts them into digital data.&#10;2. Power Source: A battery powers the remote controller, providing the necessary electricity for all components to function. The power source enables the IC and other elements to operate, ensuring that the remote can transmit infrared (IR) signals when buttons are pressed.&#10;3. Buttons: These switches allow users to interact with the remote controller. When a button is pressed, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, indicating which function or command should be executed. Each button has a unique internal configuration that helps the IC identify and process the input correctly.&#10;4. Infrared (IR) LED: This component transmits IR signals from the remote controller to the device it controls, such as a TV. When the IC generates an infrared signal based on user input, the IR LED emits this light. The TV's IR receiver then detects the signal and triggers the corresponding action (e.g., changing channels or adjusting volume).&#10;5. Wiring: Wiring connects all components within the remote controller, allowing electrical signals to flow between them. This ensures that button presses are correctly interpreted by the IC, which in turn generates appropriate IR signals for transmission via the IR LED.&#10;&#10;Together, these components work together to allow users to control devices from a distance using IR signals. When a button is pressed on the remote controller, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, which processes this input and generates an IR signal for the IR LED to transmit. The device's IR receiver then detects this signal, triggering the desired action.">

    <edge source="The transcripts do not provide specific instructions from higher up regarding the components that should not be considered for the project at the given price point. As for the limitation on the controlling capability of the device, there are no direct discussions about it in the transcripts. However, the team does seem to be focusing on adding various features and options to the remote control without significantly increasing costs. They aim to create a remote control with different shapes, color schemes, and functional cosmetic changes while leveraging existing integrated circuits and design features. The controlling capability of the device is not explicitly mentioned, but they do discuss using an integrated circuit as the brain of the remote controller and infrared bulbs for transmission." target="1. Integrated Circuit (IC): This component serves as the brain of the remote controller, processing user inputs and generating appropriate control signals. It interprets the button presses and converts them into digital data.&#10;2. Power Source: A battery powers the remote controller, providing the necessary electricity for all components to function. The power source enables the IC and other elements to operate, ensuring that the remote can transmit infrared (IR) signals when buttons are pressed.&#10;3. Buttons: These switches allow users to interact with the remote controller. When a button is pressed, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, indicating which function or command should be executed. Each button has a unique internal configuration that helps the IC identify and process the input correctly.&#10;4. Infrared (IR) LED: This component transmits IR signals from the remote controller to the device it controls, such as a TV. When the IC generates an infrared signal based on user input, the IR LED emits this light. The TV's IR receiver then detects the signal and triggers the corresponding action (e.g., changing channels or adjusting volume).&#10;5. Wiring: Wiring connects all components within the remote controller, allowing electrical signals to flow between them. This ensures that button presses are correctly interpreted by the IC, which in turn generates appropriate IR signals for transmission via the IR LED.&#10;&#10;Together, these components work together to allow users to control devices from a distance using IR signals. When a button is pressed on the remote controller, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, which processes this input and generates an IR signal for the IR LED to transmit. The device's IR receiver then detects this signal, triggering the desired action.">

    <edge source="1. The main purpose of a remote controller for a television is to control the TV's functions from a distance using signals like infrared light or radio waves. This allows users to change channels, adjust volume, and perform other actions without having to physically interact with the TV. Necessary features for a remote controller include:&#10;   a. A power on/off button to control the TV's state.&#10;   b. Buttons for changing channels and adjusting volume.&#10;   c. Signal transmission (infrared light, radio waves, or LED) to interact with the TV.&#10;   d. A timer may be useful for setting viewing duration limits or scheduling power on/off times. The need for a timer is dependent on user preferences and specific use cases.&#10;&#10;Regarding signal types, infrared light, radio waves, or LED are common methods used in remote controllers to transmit signals to the TV. The choice of signal type may depend on factors such as range, cost, and compatibility with the TV.&#10;&#10;As for the timer feature, its necessity is dependent on user preferences and specific use cases. For example, parents might find a timer useful to set viewing duration limits for their children, or users might appreciate scheduling power on/off times to conserve energy and reduce standby power consumption." target="1. Integrated Circuit (IC): This component serves as the brain of the remote controller, processing user inputs and generating appropriate control signals. It interprets the button presses and converts them into digital data.&#10;2. Power Source: A battery powers the remote controller, providing the necessary electricity for all components to function. The power source enables the IC and other elements to operate, ensuring that the remote can transmit infrared (IR) signals when buttons are pressed.&#10;3. Buttons: These switches allow users to interact with the remote controller. When a button is pressed, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, indicating which function or command should be executed. Each button has a unique internal configuration that helps the IC identify and process the input correctly.&#10;4. Infrared (IR) LED: This component transmits IR signals from the remote controller to the device it controls, such as a TV. When the IC generates an infrared signal based on user input, the IR LED emits this light. The TV's IR receiver then detects the signal and triggers the corresponding action (e.g., changing channels or adjusting volume).&#10;5. Wiring: Wiring connects all components within the remote controller, allowing electrical signals to flow between them. This ensures that button presses are correctly interpreted by the IC, which in turn generates appropriate IR signals for transmission via the IR LED.&#10;&#10;Together, these components work together to allow users to control devices from a distance using IR signals. When a button is pressed on the remote controller, it sends an electrical signal to the IC, which processes this input and generates an IR signal for the IR LED to transmit. The device's IR receiver then detects this signal, triggering the desired action.">

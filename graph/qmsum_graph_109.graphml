    <node id="The main concept of this new remote control design is to focus on simplifying the user experience by only including the most used buttons, such as power, volume, channels (numbers), play, pause, stop, and possibly navigation buttons. This minimalist design approach aims to improve user-friendliness by excluding less frequently used buttons, like the channel search function. The goal is to create a more straightforward remote control that caters to various television models while ensuring compatibility with different brands. Another consideration in the design process includes potentially integrating multiple remote controls for various devices into one unit to enhance convenience and reduce clutter." />

    <node id="1. User Interface Team: The user interface team believes that even if people buy a new television, they might still want the option to have buttons on the remote control rather than just a touch screen or voice-activated commands. This is because buttons can be more reliable and easier to use in certain situations. They also mention that users tend to lose remote controls, so it's essential to keep the design simple and user-friendly.&#10;&#10;2. Marketing Team: The marketing team agrees with the need for a simple and user-friendly design. They emphasize the importance of having basic functionalities such as power, volume, channels, play, pause, and stop buttons. Additionally, they discuss the challenge of compatibility between different television brands and how universal remotes require users to choose codes based on their TV type.&#10;&#10;3. Industrial Design Team: The industrial design team focuses on the idea of a minimalist design with the least possible amount of buttons. They agree that searching for channels using buttons is not frequently used, suggesting that these functions could be integrated differently or made accessible through other means like voice control. They also mention the possibility of designing the remote control to cater to older television models, as people may still want a physical remote even if their original one is lost or broken." />

    <node id="The goal of the remote control design, according to the discussion, is to create a user-friendly device with a minimalist design. The remote should only include the most used buttons, such as power on/off, channel changing, and numbers. Additional functions like searching for channels or programs on the television should not be included, as they are typically done through the TV interface itself. The design should also aim to make it easy to identify button functions, avoiding confusion and frustration for the user. The remote's color scheme was suggested to be all black, possibly to provide a sleek and modern appearance. Overall, the team aims to create a remote control that is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable to use." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, both the User Interface (UI) team and Marketing team are considering the needs of different TV features and international audiences when designing a new remote control. They discuss the challenge of compatibility between different television brands and how universal remotes require users to choose codes based on their TV type. The UI team mentions that not all regions use the same signal for remote controls, emphasizing the importance of ensuring compatibility across various markets. The Marketing team suggests including numerals on the remote control, understanding that customers in international markets may rely on these buttons more than others. They also discuss the idea of having two pages on the remote control, possibly catering to different TV features or user preferences in different regions. Overall, both teams are aware of the need to design a remote control that can accommodate various TV models and international audiences." />

They discuss the challenge of compatibility between different television brands and how universal remotes require users to choose codes based on their TV type. The UI team mentions that not all regions use the same signal for remote controls, emphasizing the importance of ensuring compatibility across various markets. The Marketing team suggests including numerals on the remote control, understanding that customers in international markets may rely on these buttons more than others. They also discuss the idea of having two pages on the remote control, possibly catering to different TV features or user preferences in different regions. Overall, both teams are aware of the need to design a remote control that can accommodate various TV models and international audiences.">

The design should also aim to make it easy to identify button functions, avoiding confusion and frustration for the user.

The UI team mentions that not all regions use the same signal for remote controls, emphasizing the importance of ensuring compatibility across various markets. The Marketing team suggests including numerals on the remote control, understanding that customers in international markets may rely on these buttons more than others.

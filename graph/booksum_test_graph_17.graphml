    <node id="Billy Smallbury brings the news from Casterbridge that there is still no information about Fanny Robin. Bathsheba might be particularly interested in hearing this news because she had previously asked the men to inquire about Fanny, and she may be worried about Fanny's well-being. Additionally, Fanny was a former servant of Boldwood's, so he has also taken an interest in her whereabouts. The narrative suggests that Bathsheba is also interested in Fanny's situation because she had been the one to hire her as a servant, and may feel responsible for her." />

I am always in some unfortunate&#10;plight or other,&quot; Bathsheba said, complainingly.  &quot;Why should he&#10;inquire about Fanny?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, because, as she had no friends in her childhood, he took her and&#10;put her to school, and got her her place here under your uncle.  He's&#10;a very kind man that way, but Lord--there!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never was such a hopeless man for a woman!

The first is that the bailiff is dismissed for thieving,&#10;and that I have formed a resolution to have no bailiff at all, but to&#10;manage everything with my own head and hands.&quot;&#10;&#10;The men breathed an audible breath of amazement.&#10;&#10;&quot;The next matter is, have you heard anything of Fanny?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing, ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you done anything?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I met Farmer Boldwood,&quot; said Jacob Smallbury, &quot;and I went with him&#10;and two of his men, and dragged Newmill Pond, but we found nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the new shepherd have been to Buck's Head, by Yalbury, thinking&#10;she had gone there, but nobody had seed her,&quot; said Laban Tall.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hasn't William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, ma'am, but he's not" />

Who can he have?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Young Cain Ball is a very good lad,&quot; Henery said, &quot;and Shepherd Oak&#10;don't mind his youth?&quot; he added, turning with an apologetic smile to&#10;the shepherd, who had just appeared on the scene, and was now leaning&#10;against the doorpost with his arms folded.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, I don't mind that,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;How did Cain come by such a name?&quot; asked Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh you see, mem, his pore mother, not being a Scripture-read woman,&#10;made a mistake at his christening, thinking 'twas Abel killed Cain,&#10;and called en Cain, meaning Abel all the time.

    <node id="&quot;Quite well, I thank you, Miss Everdene,&quot; said Shepherd Oak from the&#10;doorpost.  &quot;If I don't, I'll inquire.&quot;  Gabriel was rather staggered&#10;by the remarkable coolness of her manner.  Certainly nobody without&#10;previous information would have dreamt that Oak and the handsome&#10;woman before whom he stood had ever been other than strangers.  But&#10;perhaps her air was the inevitable result of the social rise which&#10;had advanced her from a cottage to a large house and fields.  The&#10;case is not unexampled in high places.  When, in the writings of the&#10;later poets, Jove and his family are found to have moved from their&#10;cramped quarters on the peak of Olympus into the wide sky above it,&#10;their words show a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.&#10;&#10;Footsteps were heard in the passage, combining in their character&#10;the qualities both of weight and measure, rather at the expense of&#10;velocity.&#10;&#10;(All.) &quot;Here's Billy Smallbury come from Casterbridge.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what's the news?&quot; said Bathsheba, as William, after marching to&#10;the middle of the hall, took a handkerchief from his" />

But everybody else was noticing you; and it was odd he&#10;didn't.  There, 'tis like him.  Rich and gentlemanly, what does he&#10;care?&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba dropped into a silence intended to express that she had&#10;opinions on the matter too abstruse for Liddy's comprehension, rather&#10;than that she had nothing to say.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear me--I had nearly forgotten the val" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Boldwood has a complex reaction to his encounter with Gabriel regarding the valentine matter. At first, he is defensive and denies knowing anything about the valentine that Bathsheba sent him. However, when Gabriel tells him that Fanny Robin wrote him a letter indicating she is confident in their upcoming marriage, Boldwood becomes visibly upset and grieved. He expresses concern for Fanny's misplaced confidence in a man he deems unworthy of her trust.&#10;&#10;Boldwood then turns his attention to the valentine from Bathsheba and contemplates responding to it. When Gabriel reveals that he recognizes the handwriting as Bathsheba's, Boldwood becomes anxious, and Oak misunderstands his reaction as suspicion towards him. Boldwood clarifies that he is simply applying himself seriously to an argument about the valentine matter.&#10;&#10;After their conversation, Boldwood ultimately returns to feeling shame and regret for his earlier outburst towards Gabriel. He again places the valentine on the mantelpiece, reflecting on the mysterious influence of its sender. The narrative suggests that Boldwood's regret stems from a sense of guilt over his initial denial of knowledge about the valentine and his heated questioning of Gabriel." />

He&#10;again placed the letter on the mantelpiece, and sat down to think of&#10;the circumstances attending it by the light of Gabriel's information.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

It was the first time in Boldwood's life&#10;that such an event had occurred.  The same fascination that caused&#10;him to think it an act which had a deliberate motive prevented&#10;him from regarding it as an impertinence.  He looked again at&#10;the direction.  The mysterious influences of night invested the&#10;writing with the presence of the unknown writer.  Somebody's--some&#10;WOMAN'S--hand had travelled softly over the paper bearing his name;&#10;her unrevealed eyes had watched every curve as she formed it; her&#10;brain had seen him in imagination the while.  Why should she have&#10;imagined him?  Her mouth--were the lips red or pale, plump or&#10;creased?--had curved itself to a certain expression as the pen went&#10;on--the corners had moved with all their natural tremulousness: what&#10;had been the expression?&#10;&#10;The vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to the words&#10;written, had no individuality.  She was" />

A slight romance attaches to him, too.  His mother was&#10;a" />
    <node id=", on the evening of St. Valentine's Day, Boldwood sat down&#10;to supper as usual, by a beaming fire of aged logs.  Upon the&#10;mantel-shelf before him was a time-piece, surmounted by a spread&#10;eagle, and upon the eagle's wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent.&#10;Here the bachelor's gaze was continually fastening itself, till the&#10;large red seal became as a blot of blood on the retina of his eye;&#10;and as he ate and drank he still read in fancy the words thereon,&#10;although they were too remote for his sight--&#10;&#10;&#10;   &quot;MARRY ME.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;The pert injunction was like those crystal substances which,&#10;colourless themselves, assume the tone of objects about them.  Here,&#10;in the quiet of Boldwood's parlour, where everything that was not&#10;grave was extraneous, and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan&#10;Sunday lasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed their&#10;tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity,&#10;imbibed from their accessories now.&#10;&#10;Since the receipt of the missive in the morning, Boldwood had" />

On approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed,&#10;the farmer drew out his pocket-book, unfastened it, and allowed it to&#10;lie open on his hand.  A letter was revealed--Bathsheba's.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was going to ask you, Oak,&quot; he said, with unreal carelessness, &quot;if&#10;you know whose writing this is?&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak glanced into the book, and replied instantly, with a flushed&#10;face, &quot;Miss Everdene's.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name.&#10;He now felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought.  The&#10;letter could of course be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry&#10;would not have been necessary.&#10;&#10;Boldwood mistook his confusion: sensitive persons are always ready&#10;with their &quot;Is it I?&quot; in preference to objective reasoning.&#10;&#10;&quot;The question was perfectly fair,&quot; he returned--and there was&#10;something incongruous in the serious earnestness with which he&#10;applied himself to an argument on a valentine.  &quot;You know it is&#10;always expected that privy inquiries will be" />
    <node id=" no--not at all,&quot; replied Gabriel, hastily, and a sigh escaped&#10;him, which the deprivation of lamb skins could hardly have caused.&#10;&#10;Before any further remark had been added a shade darkened the door,&#10;and Boldwood entered the malthouse, bestowing upon each a nod of a&#10;quality between friendliness and condescension.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! Oak, I thought you were here,&quot; he said.  &quot;I met the mail-cart&#10;ten minutes ago, and a letter was put into my hand, which I opened&#10;without reading the address.  I believe it is yours.  You must excuse&#10;the accident please.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes--not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood--not a bit,&quot; said&#10;Gabriel, readily.  He had not a correspondent on earth, nor was there&#10;a possible letter coming to him whose contents the whole parish would&#10;not have been welcome to peruse.&#10;&#10;Oak stepped aside, and read the following in an unknown hand:--&#10;&#10;&#10;   DEAR FRIEND,--I do not know your name, but I think these&#10;   few lines will reach you, which I wrote to thank you for&#10;   your kindness to me" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Boldwood has complicated thoughts and feelings towards the anonymous valentine he received. At first, he is intrigued by the mysteriousness of it, finding it hard to believe that it could be an impertinence. He becomes captivated by the vision of a woman writing the letter, imagining her eyes watching every curve as she forms them and wondering about her appearance. The valentine represents a mystery to him, and he is deeply absorbed in trying to uncover its origin and motive.&#10;&#10;Boldwood tries to imagine the identity of the sender by contemplating the woman's handwriting and the expression on her lips as she wrote the letter. He creates a mental image of a &quot;misty shape&quot; who takes form when he dozes off, only to disappear when he wakes up, leaving behind the letter that justifies the dream. The valentine becomes a source of fascination for him, and its presence distorts the symmetry of his existence as he contemplates the possibility of an ideal passion.&#10;&#10;Overall, Boldwood is deeply absorbed by the mystery of the valentine and tries to imagine the identity of the sender through her handwriting, expression, and appearance.

    <node id=" what&#10;had been the expression?&#10;&#10;The vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to the words&#10;written, had no individuality.  She was a misty shape, and well she&#10;might be, considering that her original was at that moment sound&#10;asleep and oblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky.&#10;Whenever Boldwood dozed she took a form, and comparatively ceased to&#10;be a vision: when he awoke there was the letter justifying the dream.&#10;&#10;The moon shone to-night, and its light was not of a customary kind.&#10;His window admitted only a reflection of its rays, and the pale sheen&#10;had that reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward and&#10;lighting up his ceiling in an unnatural way, casting shadows in&#10;strange places, and putting lights where shadows had used to be.&#10;&#10;The substance of the epistle had occupied him but little in&#10;comparison with the fact of its arrival.  He suddenly wondered&#10;if anything more might be found in the envelope than what he had&#10;withdrawn.  He jumped out of bed in the weird light, took the&#10;letter, pulled out the flimsy sheet, shook the envelope--searched it.&#10;Nothing" />

The disturbance was as the first&#10;floating weed to Columbus--the contemptibly little suggesting&#10;possibilities of the infinitely great.&#10;&#10;The letter must have had an origin and a motive.  That the latter&#10;was of the smallest magnitude compatible with its existence at all,&#10;Boldwood, of course, did not know.  And such an explanation did not&#10;strike him as a possibility even.  It is foreign to a mystified&#10;condition of mind to realize of the mystifier that the processes of&#10;approving a course suggested by circumstance, and of striking out a&#10;course from inner impulse, would look the same in the result.  The&#10;vast difference between starting a train of events, and directing&#10;into a particular groove a series already started, is rarely apparent&#10;to the person confounded by the issue.&#10;&#10;When Boldwood went to bed he placed the valentine in the corner of&#10;the looking-glass.

Bathsheba, without looking&#10;within a right angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep among the&#10;flock.&#10;&#10;It perplexed her first.  If there had been a respectable minority on&#10;either side, the case would have been most natural.  If nobody had&#10;regarded her, she would have taken the matter indifferently--such&#10;cases had occurred.  If everybody, this man included, she would have&#10;taken it as a matter of course--people had done so before.  But the&#10;smallness of the exception made the mystery.&#10;&#10;She soon knew thus much of the recusant's appearance.  He was a&#10;gentlemanly man, with full and distinctly outlined Roman features,&#10;the prominences of which glowed in the sun with a bronze-like&#10;richness of tone.  He was erect in attitude, and quiet in demeanour.&#10;One characteristic pre-eminently marked him--dignity.&#10;&#10;Apparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age&#10;at which a man's" />
    <node id=" characteristic pre-eminently marked him--dignity.&#10;&#10;Apparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age&#10;at which a man's aspect naturally ceases to alter for the term of&#10;a dozen years or so; and, artificially, a woman's does likewise.&#10;Thirty-five and fifty were his limits of variation--he might have&#10;been either, or anywhere between the two.&#10;&#10;It may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and&#10;generous enough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate&#10;beauty they may discern by the way.  Probably, as with persons&#10;playing whist for love, the consciousness of a certain immunity under&#10;any circumstances from that worst possible ultimate, the having to&#10;pay, makes them unduly speculative.  Bathsheba was convinced that&#10;this unmoved person was not a married man.&#10;&#10;When marketing was over, she rushed off to Liddy, who was waiting&#10;for her beside the yellow gig in which they had driven to town.&#10;The horse was put in, and on they trotted--Bathsheba's sugar, tea,&#10;and drapery parcels being packed behind, and expressing in some&#10;indescribable manner, by" />
    <node id="In this narrative, the scene described is set in the old hall of Bathsheba's farm. After getting ready and finishing her dress, Bathsheba enters the hall followed by Liddy. She sits down at a table with her time-book, pen, and a canvas money-bag filled with coins. Liddy chooses a position near her and begins to sew. The men whom Bathsheba is about to pay have seated themselves on a long form and a settle at the lower end of the hall.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba then opens an old volume of the Book of Ruth, seeking out a specific verse. As she reads the sublime words, she blushes slightly, feeling abashed by the wisdom of the text confronting her folly. She places the key on the book, and, after repeating the verse, turns the book around for Liddy to see. When Liddy inquires about whom Bathsheba tried, she refuses to tell, and the narrative then shifts focus to describe Bathsheba's experience at church that morning, where she had noticed a well-dressed man who paid no attention to her during the service." />

She sat down at a table and opened the time-book, pen in&#10;her hand, with a canvas money-bag beside her.  From this she poured&#10;a small heap of coin.  Liddy chose a position at her elbow and began&#10;to sew, sometimes pausing and looking round, or, with the air of&#10;a privileged person, taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying&#10;before her and surveying it merely as a work of art, while strictly&#10;preventing her countenance from expressing any" />

Folly in the concrete blushed, persisted in her intention,&#10;and placed the key on the book.  A rusty patch immediately upon the&#10;verse, caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon, told&#10;that this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the&#10;purpose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now keep steady, and be silent,&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;The verse was repeated; the book turned round; Bathsheba blushed&#10;guiltily.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who did you try?&quot; said Liddy curiously.&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall not tell you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you notice Mr. Boldwood's doings in church this morning, miss?&quot;&#10;Liddy continued, adumbrating by the remark the track her thoughts had&#10;taken.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said Bathsheba, with serene indifference.&#10;&#10;&quot;His pew is exactly opposite yours," />

The paces slackened, turned in at the wicket, and, what&#10;was most unusual, came up the mossy path close to the door.

Why didn't he stop at the gate? Lord!  'Tis a&#10;gentleman!  I see the top of his hat.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Be quiet!&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;The further expression of Liddy's concern was continued by aspect&#10;instead of narrative.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why doesn't Mrs. Coggan go to the door?&quot; Bathshe" />
    <node id="Bathsheba's decision to become a farmer is publicly indicated when she makes her debut in the marketplace as a buying and selling farmer. This occurs on a Saturday, where she attracts a lot of attention due to her beauty and unconventional role as a woman farmer. The interest is so pronounced that it becomes the talk of the town, and even women seem to take notice of her presence in the market." />
    <node id=" or three only of the farmers were personally known to Bathsheba,&#10;and to these she had made her way.  But if she was to be the&#10;practical woman she had intended to show herself, business must&#10;be carried on, introductions or none, and she ultimately acquired&#10;confidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely known to&#10;her by hearsay.  Bathsheba too had her sample-bags, and by degrees&#10;adopted the professional pour into the hand--holding up the grains&#10;in her narrow palm for inspection, in perfect Casterbridge manner.&#10;&#10;Something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth, and&#10;in the keenly pointed corners of her red mouth when, with parted&#10;lips, she somewhat defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with&#10;a tall man, suggested that there was potentiality enough in that&#10;lithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of sex, and daring&#10;enough to carry them out.  But her eyes had a softness--invariably a&#10;softness--which, had they not been dark, would have seemed mistiness;&#10;as they were, it lowered an expression that might have been piercing&#10;to simple clearness." />
    <node id=" think.  Do you&#10;know at all who he could be?&quot;&#10;&#10;Liddy couldn't think.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can't you guess at all?&quot; said Bathsheba with some disappointment.&#10;&#10;&quot;I haven't a notion; besides, 'tis no difference, since he took less&#10;notice of you than any of the rest.  Now, if he'd taken more, it&#10;would have mattered a great deal.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just then, and they&#10;bowled along in silence.  A low carriage, bowling along still more&#10;rapidly behind a horse of unimpeachable breed, overtook and passed&#10;them.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, there he is!&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;Liddy looked.  &quot;That!  That's Farmer Boldwood--of course 'tis--the&#10;man you couldn't see the other day when he called.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Farmer Boldwood,&quot; murmured Bathsheba, and looked at him as he&#10;outstripped them.  The farmer had never turned his head once, but&#10;with eyes fixed on the most advanced point along the road, passed as&#10;unconsciously and abstractedly as if Bathsheba and her" />
    <node id=" then shake his head.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, 'tis a pity she's so headstrong,&quot; the first would say.  &quot;But we&#10;ought to be proud of her here--she lightens up the old place.  'Tis&#10;such a shapely maid, however, that she'll soon get picked up.&quot;&#10;&#10;It would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of her engagement&#10;in such an occupation had almost as much to do with the magnetism&#10;as had the beauty of her face and movements.  However, the interest&#10;was general, and this Saturday's _debut_ in the forum, whatever it&#10;may have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer, was&#10;unquestionably a triumph to her as the maiden.  Indeed, the sensation&#10;was so pronounced that her instinct on two or three occasions was&#10;merely to walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow, like a&#10;little sister of a little Jove, and to neglect closing prices&#10;altogether.&#10;&#10;The numerous evidences of her power to attract were only thrown into&#10;greater relief by a marked exception.  Women seem to have eyes in&#10;their ribbons for such matters as these. " />
    <node id="Before Boldwood followed him to the fold, Farmer Oak took the lambs that he had just markeds with &quot;B. E.&quot; and handed them over to Cainy, instructing him to take them away to the lambing field. Oak then turned his attention to Boldwood's questions about the valentine matter and revealed that Bathsheba was the sender of the valentine.&#10;&#10;When Boldwood approached the fold, he followed Oak with a last resolve, annihilating return, before hesitating and turning back. Upon seeing Oak marking the lambs with &quot;B. E.,&quot; Boldwood realized that they belonged to Bathsheba and became anxious about the valentine. He then took the letter addressed to &quot;The New Shepherd&quot; and decided to deliver it himself, as he saw an opportunity to speak to Oak. Meanwhile, Gabriel was descending the hill towards Warren's Malthouse, and Boldwood followed him at a distance." />
    <node id=" as a treat.&#10;But, before we go, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and we'll mark this lot&#10;and have done with 'em.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron, dipped it&#10;into the pot, and imprinted on the buttocks of the infant sheep the&#10;initials of her he delighted to muse on--&quot;B. E.,&quot; which signified to&#10;all the region round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer&#10;Bathsheba Everdene, and to no one else.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Cainy, shoulder your two, and off. Good morning, Mr. Boldwood.&quot;&#10;The shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he&#10;had himself brought, and vanished with them in the direction of the&#10;lambing field hard by--their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful&#10;state, pleasantly contrasting with their death's-door plight of half&#10;an hour before.&#10;&#10;Boldwood followed him a little way up the field, hesitated, and&#10;turned back.  He followed him again with a last resolve, annihilating&#10;return.  On approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed,&#10;the farmer drew out his pocket" />

The tall&#10;form was that of Gabriel Oak; the small one that of George; the&#10;articles in course of transit were hurdles.&#10;&#10;&quot;Wait,&quot; said Boldwood. &quot;That's the man on the hill.  I'll take the&#10;letter to him myself.&quot;&#10;&#10;To Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to another man.  It&#10;was an opportunity.  Exhibiting a face pregnant with intention, he&#10;entered the snowy field.&#10;&#10;Gabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards the right.  The&#10;glow stretched down in this direction now, and touched the distant&#10;roof of Warren's Malthouse--whither the shepherd was apparently bent:&#10;Boldwood followed at a distance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;A MORNING MEETING--THE LETTER AGAIN&#10;&#10;&#10;The scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did not penetrate&#10;to its interior, which was, as usual, lighted by a rival glow of&#10;similar hue, radiating from the hearth.&#10;&#10;The maltster, after having lain down in his clothes for a few" />
    <node id="Based on Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse in the Book of Ruth and Liddy's questions, several inferences can be made about Bathsheba's actions and intentions. First, Bathsheba appears to be engaging in some introspection and self-reflection, as she blushes and seems abashed by the wisdom of the text confronting her folly. This suggests that she is considering her decisions and actions, possibly seeking guidance or wisdom from the biblical story.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's decision not to reveal whom she tried with the verse may indicate a desire for privacy and independence in her decision-making process. She seems determined to handle her affairs without external interference, as evidenced by her indifference toward Mr. Boldwood's behavior during church service.&#10;&#10;However, Liddy's persistence in bringing up Mr. Boldwood and his apparent lack of attention toward Bathsheba eventually piques her curiosity. Although Bathsheba initially denies having noticed Mr. Boldwood's actions, she ultimately asks for more information about him, suggesting that she may be interested in learning more about this wealthy bachelor farmer.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse and Liddy's questions reveal a complex mixture of self-reflection, determination, and curiosity about her potential suitors, such as Mr. Boldwood." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Frank and Fan have arranged to meet after dark, but Frank is unable to leave the barracks to see her that night because the gates are closed and he has no leave. He tells Fan that they will not be able to see each other until the following morning. They plan to meet at Mrs. Twills's house in North Street, as Fan is concerned about being seen near the barracks with &quot;bad women&quot; around. The narrative suggests that Frank and Fan have had assignations before, possibly across the river, but it is not clear how they usually communicate or arrange to meet. It is also mentioned that Fan has come to see Frank unexpectedly, which contributes to his inability to leave the barracks to meet with her." />

    <node id="The &quot;gentlemanly man&quot; with distinctive Roman features and an air of dignity that Bathsheba notices among the crowd during church service is Mr. Boldwood. His presence perplexes her because it is unusual for someone who is wealthy, gentlemanly, and seemingly interested in her (as evidenced by his presence at church where she is attending) to not look at her once during the entire service, especially when everyone else is noticing her. This unexpected behavior from Mr. Boldwood, a man of dignity and distinction, intrigues Bathsheba and makes her curious about him." />
    <node id="The scene of Bathsheba entering the hall to find her men waiting for her, with her about to pay them while Liddy watches on, is set in the old hall of Bathsheba's farm.

Below, down to the&#10;water's edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.&#10;&#10;An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their&#10;regularity, sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy&#10;atmosphere.  It was a neighbouring clock striking ten.  The bell was&#10;in the open air, and being overlaid with several inches of muffling&#10;snow, had lost its voice for the time.&#10;&#10;About this hour the snow abated: ten flakes fell where twenty had&#10;fallen, then one had the room of ten.  Not long after a form moved&#10;by the brink of the river.&#10;&#10;By its outline upon the colourless background, a close observer&#10;might have seen that it was small.  This was all that was positively&#10;discoverable, though it seemed human.&#10;&#10;The shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow,&#10;though sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep.

Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but the gurgle&#10;and cluck of one of these invisible wheels--together with a few small&#10;sounds which a sad man would have called moans, and a happy man&#10;laughter--caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling&#10;objects in other parts of the stream.&#10;&#10;The window was struck again in the same manner.&#10;&#10;Then a noise was heard, apparently produced by the opening of the&#10;window.

These features made up the mass.&#10;If anything could be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if any&#10;thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath.

The word &quot;Five&quot; represented the fifth window from the&#10;end of the wall.&#10;&#10;Here the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller.  The figure was&#10;stooping.  Then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the&#10;fifth window.  It smacked against the wall at a point several yards&#10;from its mark.  The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the&#10;execution of a woman.  No man who had ever seen bird, rabbit, or&#10;squirrel in his childhood, could possibly have thrown with such utter&#10;imbecility as was shown here.&#10;&#10;Another attempt, and another; till by degrees the wall must have&#10;become pimpled with the adhering lumps of snow.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Frank and Fan will be able to meet the following morning. Frank explains to Fan that he cannot leave the barracks that night because the gates are closed and he has no leave, stating that &quot;we are all of us as good as in the county gaol till tomorrow morning.&quot; They plan to meet at Mrs. Twills's house in North Street in the morning." />
    <node id="Based on the conversation, the next step for Frank regarding his promise to marry Fanny is to proceed with the plans to get married. He has agreed to put up the banns in his parish and she will do the same in hers, indicating that they plan to go through with a church wedding. However, Frank seems to be hesitant or unsure about following through on his promise, as he forgets to obtain permission from his superiors before leaving Casterbridge and is surprised by Fanny's sudden arrival. Despite this, Fanny is eager to marry him and has already secured the necessary money for her clothes. Frank and Fanny plan to meet in the morning at Mrs. Twills's house in North Street, where they will likely finalize their plans for the wedding. It is also mentioned that they will need to have the banns published in both of their parishes, which may require them to take additional steps to ensure that this is done correctly and in a timely manner." />
    <node id="The narrative does not specify the name of the man that Bathsheba is trying to identify and settle accounts with, nor does it mention the amount she owes him. The text focuses on Bathsheba's internal thoughts and her experience at church rather than providing details about the men she is paying." />
    <node id="The scene described in the text is set in the old hall of Bathsheba's farm. Bathsheba, dressed in her finished attire and followed by Liddy, enters the upper end of the hall where her men have gathered at the lower extremity. She sits down at a table with her time-book, pen, and a canvas money-bag filled with coins. The men are there to receive their wages, and Bathsheba is conducting business by distributing wages to them. Liddy chooses a position near her mistress and begins to sew. This scene is a significant moment in the narrative as it showcases Bathsheba's role as a competent and confident farm owner, managing her business and interacting with her workers." />

This is an important task for Oak as it helps in keeping a record of the lambs and their ownership.

The moon is still visible, but its light is unusual. It shines through Boldwood's window, casting reflected rays and creating an unnatural lighting situation in his room. The moonlight has a reversed direction, similar to how snow reflects light, illuminating his ceiling and casting shadows in strange places while also placing lights where there were once shadows.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Fanny Robin has &quot;run away with the soldiers,&quot; specifically Sergeant Troy of the Eleventh Dragoon-Guards regiment. They were stationed in Casterbridge but had to leave suddenly. Fanny either deliberately or accidentally missed her chance to be with Sergeant Troy before the regiment left, so she followed them. The regiment was headed to Melchester and &quot;onwards,&quot; but the narrative does not provide a more specific destination for Fanny or the soldiers.&#10;&#10;Gabriel Oak expresses concern about Fanny's situation and her confidence in marrying Sergeant Troy, whom he describes as &quot;not one to build much hope upon.&quot; Farmer Boldwood shares this concern and mentions that Troy has a slight romantic past but is not trustworthy, particularly in a serious matter like marriage. However, it appears Fanny is unaware of this assessment, believing her wedding with Sergeant Troy will still occur." />
    <node id="Bathsheba is considering using chance to decide whether to send a valentine to Boldwood or Teddy because she is engaging in introspection and self-reflection, seeking guidance or wisdom on her decisions. The special verse from the Book of Ruth that she reads with Liddy makes her blush and seem abashed, indicating that she is confronting her own folly. &#10;&#10;Her decision not to reveal whom she tried the verse with may suggest a desire for privacy and independence in her decision-making process. However, Liddy's persistence in bringing up Mr. Boldwood and his apparent lack of attention toward Bathsheba eventually piques her curiosity. Although Bathsheba initially denies having noticed Mr. Boldwood's actions, she ultimately asks for more information about him, suggesting that she may be interested in learning more about this wealthy bachelor farmer.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the prospect of sending a valentine to Boldwood might be influenced by her growing interest in him, as well as her curiosity about his lack of attention toward her. The chance element could represent Bathsheba's desire to make a decision without external interference or pressure, consistent with her earlier determination to handle her affairs independently." />
    <node id="The letter is addressed to &quot;Teddy Coggan, Over the Hill, Weatherbury,&quot; as stated in the narrative. Initially, Liddy thinks that the valentine Bathsheba bought might be for Farmer Boldwood, but then Bathsheba clarifies that it is actually for little Teddy Coggan." />
    <node id=" too abstruse for Liddy's comprehension, rather&#10;than that she had nothing to say.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear me--I had nearly forgotten the valentine I bought yesterday,&quot;&#10;she exclaimed at length.&#10;&#10;&quot;Valentine! who for, miss?&quot; said Liddy.  &quot;Farmer Boldwood?&quot;&#10;&#10;It was the single name among all possible wrong ones that just at&#10;this moment seemed to Bathsheba more pertinent than the right.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, no.  It is only for little Teddy Coggan.  I have promised him&#10;something, and this will be a pretty surprise for him.  Liddy, you&#10;may as well bring me my desk and I'll direct it at once.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illuminated and embossed&#10;design in post-octavo, which had been bought on the previous&#10;market-day at the chief stationer's in Casterbridge.

The narrative highlights that even though there are no obvious signs like those found in woodland scenery, a close observer can still perceive the changes of the seasons in such a landscape. The changes may be less familiar but are just as significant.&#10;3. Winter has reached its full expression on the moor, with the ground covered by an unbroken layer of snow that hides any irregularities, making it formless and without clear features. It merely suggests the presence of something else - the limit or lowest layer of a firmament of snow.&#10;4. The atmospheric conditions described in the scene contribute to a contemplative and melancholic mood, which is further emphasized by Farmer Boldwood's listless state of mind as he observes the desolate landscape." />
    <node id="&#10;For dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a&#10;certain town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury,&#10;at a later hour on this same snowy evening--if that may be called a&#10;prospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.&#10;&#10;It was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing&#10;any great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love&#10;becomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope:&#10;when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at&#10;opportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation&#10;does not prompt to enterprise.&#10;&#10;The scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river,&#10;behind which rose a high wall.  On the right was a tract of land,&#10;partly meadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a&#10;wide undulating upland.&#10;&#10;The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this&#10;kind than amid woodland scenery.

The whole effect&#10;resembled a sunset as childhood resembles age.&#10;&#10;In other directions, the fields and sky were so much of one colour by&#10;the snow, that it was difficult in a hasty glance to tell whereabouts&#10;the horizon occurred; and in general there was here, too, that&#10;before-mentioned preternatural inversion of light and shade which&#10;attends the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in the sky&#10;is found on the earth, and the shades of earth are in the sky.

Still, to a close observer, they&#10;are just as perceptible; the difference is that their media of&#10;manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well-known ones&#10;as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf.  Many are not&#10;so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to imagine in considering&#10;the general torpidity of a moor or waste.  Winter, in coming to the&#10;country hereabout, advanced in well-marked stages, wherein might&#10;have been successively observed the retreat of the snakes, the&#10;transformation of the ferns, the filling of the pools, a rising of&#10;fogs, the embrowning by frost, the collapse of the fungi, and an&#10;obliteration by snow.&#10;&#10;This climax of the series had been reached to-night on the aforesaid&#10;moor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were&#10;forms without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing,&#10;and without more character than that of being the limit of something&#10;else--the lowest layer of a firmament of snow.

    <node id="Based on Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse in the Book of Ruth and Liddy's questions, several inferences can be made about Bathsheba's actions and emotions. Firstly, she seems to be engaged in introspection and self-reflection, as indicated by her blush and appearance of abashment while reading the verse. This suggests that she is contemplating her decisions and seeking guidance or wisdom from the biblical story.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's decision not to reveal whom she tried with the verse may indicate a desire for privacy and independence in her decision-making process, as she seems determined to handle her affairs without external interference. This is further evidenced by her indifference toward Mr. Boldwood's behavior during church service.&#10;&#10;However, Liddy's persistence in bringing up Mr. Boldwood and his apparent lack of attention toward Bathsheba eventually piques her curiosity, leading her to ask for more information about him. This suggests that she may be interested in learning more about this wealthy bachelor farmer, indicating a potential emotional shift on her part.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse and Liddy's questions reveal a complex mixture of self-reflection, determination, and curiosity about her potential suitors, such as Mr. Boldwood." />

However, Oak handles the situation with grace and accepts Miss Everdene's decision, focusing instead on performing his duties as a shepherd to the best of his abilities." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Gabriel Oak and his assistant Cainy Ball are in the middle of the lambing process, which involves helping ewes give birth to lambs. This year's lambing has been particularly challenging for Oak, who has had to work in difficult weather conditions, getting wet through twice a day for the past two weeks due to snow or rain. Additionally, the lambing season has been prolonged, with Oak noting that they still have not finished the lambing, which is unusual as it was all over by Sexajessamine Sunday last year.&#10;&#10;Cainy Ball informs Oak that two more ewes have given birth to twins, which is more common than usual this year. This higher number of twins could be contributing to the difficulty of the lambing process, as twin pregnancies can be more complicated and require more assistance from shepherds like Oak and Cainy Ball.&#10;&#10;Oak marks the newborn lambs with the initials &quot;B. E.&quot; to signify ownership by Farmer Bathsheba Everdene, which is an important task for him as it helps in keeping a record of the lambs and their ownership. This marking process is done using a marking iron and pot of paint, which Oak takes from his pockets.&#10;&#10;Overall, based on the conversation between Gabriel Oak and Joseph Poorgrass, the progress of lambing this year has been difficult, with a higher number of twins and prolonged lambing season compared to previous years. This has required more effort and assistance from Oak and his team, including Cainy Ball." />

They were stationed in Casterbridge but had to leave suddenly. Fanny either deliberately or accidentally missed her chance to be with Sergeant Troy before the regiment left, so she followed them. The regiment was headed to Melchester and &quot;onwards,&quot; but the narrative does not provide a more specific destination for Fanny or the soldiers.&#10;&#10;Gabriel Oak expresses concern about Fanny's situation and her confidence in marrying Sergeant Troy, whom he describes as &quot;not one to build much hope upon.&quot; Farmer Boldwood shares this concern and mentions that Troy has a slight romantic past but is not trustworthy, particularly in a serious matter like marriage. However, it appears Fanny is unaware of this assessment, believing her wedding with Sergeant Troy will still occur.">

First, Bathsheba appears to be engaging in some introspection and self-reflection, as she blushes and seems abashed by the wisdom of the text confronting her folly. This suggests that she is considering her decisions and actions, possibly seeking guidance or wisdom from the biblical story.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's decision not to reveal whom she tried with the verse may indicate a desire for privacy and independence in her decision-making process. She seems determined to handle her affairs without external interference, as evidenced by her indifference toward Mr. Boldwood's behavior during church service.&#10;&#10;However, Liddy's persistence in bringing up Mr. Boldwood and his apparent lack of attention toward Bathsheba eventually piques her curiosity. Although Bathsheba initially denies having noticed Mr. Boldwood's actions, she ultimately asks for more information about him, suggesting that she may be interested in learning more about this wealthy bachelor farmer.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse and Liddy's questions reveal a complex mixture of self-reflection, determination, and curiosity about her potential suitors, such as Mr. Boldwood.">

However, the full power of the clear heaven is not yet equal to that of a cloudy sky at noon. Boldwood stands leaning over a field gate to the east, observing the scene. The moon is still visible, but its light is unusual. It shines through Boldwood's window, casting reflected rays and creating an unnatural lighting situation in his room. The moonlight has a reversed direction, similar to how snow reflects light, illuminating his ceiling and casting shadows in strange places while also placing lights where there were once shadows. This atypical celestial display sets a melancholic and contemplative mood, which aligns with Boldwood's listless state of mind.">

This suggests that she may be interested in learning more about this wealthy bachelor farmer, indicating a potential emotional shift on her part.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse and Liddy's questions reveal a complex mixture of self-reflection, determination, and curiosity about her potential suitors, such as Mr. Boldwood.">

    <edge source="The scene described in the text is set in the old hall of Bathsheba's farm. Bathsheba, dressed in her finished attire and followed by Liddy, enters the upper end of the hall where her men have gathered at the lower extremity. She sits down at a table with her time-book, pen, and a canvas money-bag filled with coins. The men are there to receive their wages, and Bathsheba is conducting business by distributing wages to them. Liddy chooses a position near her mistress and begins to sew. This scene is a significant moment in the narrative as it showcases Bathsheba's role as a competent and confident farm owner, managing her business and interacting with her workers." target="Bathsheba and Liddy were sitting on the floor in one of the rooms in an old house, sorting through a complication of papers, books, bottles, and rubbish. These items were remnants from the household stores of the late occupier, indicating that Bathsheba was going through her predecessor's belongings, possibly to decide what to do with them.">

Initially, Liddy thinks that the valentine Bathsheba bought might be for Farmer Boldwood, but then Bathsheba clarifies that it is actually for little Teddy Coggan." target="Based on Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse in the Book of Ruth and Liddy's questions, several inferences can be made about Bathsheba's actions and emotions. Firstly, she seems to be engaged in introspection and self-reflection, as indicated by her blush and appearance of abashment while reading the verse. This suggests that she is contemplating her decisions and seeking guidance or wisdom from the biblical story.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's decision not to reveal whom she tried with the verse may indicate a desire for privacy and independence in her decision-making process, as she seems determined to handle her affairs without external interference. This is further evidenced by her indifference toward Mr. Boldwood's behavior during church service.&#10;&#10;However, Liddy's persistence in bringing up Mr. Boldwood and his apparent lack of attention toward Bathsheba eventually piques her curiosity, leading her to ask for more information about him. This suggests that she may be interested in learning more about this wealthy bachelor farmer, indicating a potential emotional shift on her part.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's interactions with the special verse and Liddy's questions reveal a complex mixture of self-reflection, determination, and curiosity about her potential suitors, such as Mr. Boldwood.">

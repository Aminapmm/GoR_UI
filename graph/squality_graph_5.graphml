This was discovered when Thig, who had surveyed the planet, returned and destroyed Kam, and then Torp was forced to kill Thig. Torp wrote in the ship's log that he could feel the insidious virus of the disease, but his writing ended abruptly.&#10;&#10;The Earthwoman and children traveling there are at risk of being exposed to this disease, which causes violent insanity. Torp had already shown signs of being affected before his writing ended, indicating that the disease can act quickly. Therefore, it is not safe for the Earthwoman and children to travel to 72-P-3." />
    <node id=" a madman!&#10; &#10; The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove. The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of the Orthan.&#10; &#10; So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that victory had given him to drive him along.&#10; &#10; He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.&#10; &#10; He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and read the last few nervously scrawled lines:&#10;  Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent there." />
    <node id="&#10;  Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended. Already I feel the insidious virus of....&#10; &#10; &#10; And there his writing ended abruptly.&#10; &#10; Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.&#10; &#10; Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.&#10; &#10; He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months" />
    <node id=" above the average in height—but his body was thick and powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.&#10; &#10; The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.&#10; &#10; Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet, however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope made of 72-P" />

Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.&#10; &#10; The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.&#10; &#10; Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished metal at the reflection of himself!&#10; &#10; The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped across the mouth and neck of the stranger....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was going stale. He" />
    <node id="rum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching the ship echoed through the hull-plates.&#10; &#10; He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that crowded his mind.&#10; &#10; He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that, despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer space.&#10; &#10; He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories were hot, bitter pains.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he heaved a" />
    <node id=" a new epic of the west that lived no longer. He mentally titled it: &quot;Rustlers' Riot&quot; and blocked in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never be written, but he toyed with the idea.&#10; &#10; So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from the unquestioning worship of the Horde!&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;You have done well,&quot; announced Torp when Thig had completed his report on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. &quot;We now have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to Ortha at once.&#10; &#10; &quot;I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient for the purposes of complete liquidation.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why,&quot; asked Thig" />
    <node id="1. Thig needs to have his blood checked for disease because he has just witnessed and been involved in a violent episode where he killed Kam and was about to be killed by Torp, who then also showed signs of the same violent insanity. They suspect that there might be a pernicious disease on the planet that affects the brain centers and causes violent insanity, as noted in Torp's log entry. Thig wants to confirm if he has been infected with this disease, which seems to have rapid onset and devastating effects.&#10;&#10;2. Thig feels an urgency to return to Earth after witnessing the power of the decomposition blaster and the ship's departure from the planet because he has realized that he must protect Ellen (the Earthwoman) and her children from being exposed to this disease. The decomposer blaster, which can reduce flesh or vegetable fiber to ashes using invisible radiations, reminds him of the potential consequences of this disease and how it can destroy individuals and families. Moreover, after seeing the ship leave the planet's surface, he decides to take action by cutting free an auxiliary lifeboat and setting a course for Ortha, knowing that Torp's body will help confirm his final message about the danger on 72-P-3." />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,&quot; ordered Torp shortly. &quot;His words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.&quot;&#10; &#10; Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.&#10; &#10; The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an empty world—this planet was not for them.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible for his sudden madness.&#10; &#10; The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the weapon. He tugged it free.&#10; &#10; In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face, the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled out into a senseless whinny.&#10; &#10; Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and chest. He was a madman!&#10; &#10; The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and now the apparent return of the man" />
    <node id=" blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed him with those savage blows upon the head.&#10; &#10; Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his unconscious body.&#10; &#10; Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible for his sudden madness.&#10; &#10; The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association of memories brought him" />
    <node id="The Orthan, a member of an advanced alien race called the Hordes of Ortha, initially questions the value of the Hordes' sole devotion to their civilization at the expense of all other interests. He wonders what good it would do to populate new worlds with more of the same, as he sees it. However, his perspective gets challenged by his emotional experiences and interactions with humans during his time on Earth.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Thig (the Orthan) develops a sense of sentimentality towards Earth's beauty, such as when he recalls the Grand Canyon and mornings in the desert. He also forms an emotional bond with a human woman named Ellen and her sick child, showing compassion and care for them.&#10;&#10;Thig's experiences on Earth open his mind to new ways of thinking and feeling, making him question the Horde's relentless pursuit of growth and power over all else. As he starts empathizing with humans, Thig grapples with the idea of eliminating an entire species for the sake of the Horde's expansion. His growing individualism and self-awareness lead him to challenge the very foundations of the Horde's culture and values.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Orthan's perspective on the Hordes' devotion to their civilization changes as he experiences emotions and human connections that conflict with his people's single-minded focus on growth and power. This emotional journey raises questions about the morality of the Horde's expansionist goals and highlights the value of individuality, empathy, and compassion." />

A laborer thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty added zest to every day's life.&#10; &#10; The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered, would one new world—or a hundred—populated by the Hordes add to the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast mechanical hives.&#10; &#10; There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever, who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept—the son of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.&#10; &#10; Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so" />
    <node id=" nothing must stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an empty world—this planet was not for them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Turn back!&quot; he cried wildly. &quot;I must go back to Earth. There is a woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need this planet.&quot;&#10; &#10; Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac of the finest members of the Horde.&#10; &#10; &quot;No human being is more important than the Horde,&quot; he stated baldly.&#10;&quot;This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we must eliminate for the good of the Horde.&quot;&#10; &#10; Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it could be uttered.&#10; &#10; Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over" />

Strange thoughts were afloat in the chaos of his cool Orthan brain.&#10; &#10; Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world, including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would, of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people, imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the Hordes?&#10; &#10; Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer thought the same thoughts that a governor" />

Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion, their love-life, their everything!&#10; &#10; So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their heads.&#10; &#10; For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.&#10; &#10; &quot;There is nothing more to learn,&quot; he informed his impassive comrades.&#10;&quot;Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required.

They are primitive humans even as our race was once a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own degree of knowledge and comfort?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Only the good of the Horde matters!&quot; shouted Torp angrily. &quot;Shall a race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,&quot; gritted out Thig savagely.&#10;&quot;Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.

When he discovers that Planet 72-P-3 is unfit for colonization due to a deadly disease that causes violent insanity, he realizes that the Earthwoman and children are at risk if they travel there.

He had destroyed the real Terry and now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.&#10; &#10; The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her dreams and happiness must never be shattered.&#10; &#10; The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines of Long Island in the growing twilight.&#10; &#10; A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a cowboy suddenly transported to another world.

They have a device that can transfer memories and knowledge to one of their own, allowing them to disguise themselves as an Earthman. Thig, who is emotionless and robot-like, is chosen for this task. He is to scout the planet without raising suspicion while Torp and Kam explore the inner planets. Thig's role is to gather information about Earth's resources and temperatures, which he has done and reported back to Torp.&#10;&#10;However, Thig has developed a desire to protect Ellen (an Earth woman) and her children from a potential disease that he witnessed on Earth.

    <node id="Thig's sudden attempt to attack his commander, Torp, was triggered by a combination of factors. First, the association of memories brought on by the cases of fragile instruments above his head reminded him of the heavy blaster in its rack beneath them. This, in turn, led him to feel the weapon and tug it free.&#10;&#10;Second, while crawling towards the door with the blaster, Thig collapsed on his face, causing Torp to scuffle out of silence and cry out in surprise. The sight of his commander, a man he had killed and who was now apparently alive again, likely added to his confusion and madness.&#10;&#10;Finally, Thig's rigidly trained brain had been jolted from its accustomed groove by the shock of Kam's death and the return of the man he had killed. This shock, combined with the thought of protecting Ellen and the children, led him to shoot Torp &quot;mercifully&quot; before that vacant mad stare set him to gibbering and shrieking.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it was a combination of Thig's suspicion towards Torp, his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and the shock of seeing the man he had killed come back to life that triggered his attempt to attack Torp." />

Slowly the flaring snout of his weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.&#10; &#10; Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated matter.

He hadn't dared touch the machine since.&#10; &#10; For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on a trailer tour of the West that very summer. Since that promise, he could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out of his subconscious. Yet he had to write at least three novelets and a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great adventure—or the trip was off.&#10; &#10; So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a salable" />

He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;There it is,&quot; announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured Earthman to the metal deck-plates. &quot;It is a male of the species that must have built the cities we saw as we landed.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He resembles Thig,&quot; announced Kam. &quot;But for the strange covering he wears he might be Thig.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thig will be this creature!&quot; announced Torp. &quot;With a psychic relay we will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to the brain of Thig!

    <node id="The struggle between Kam and Thig results in Kam being killed by his own decomposition blaster, which was triggered by Thig. The weapon causes half of Kam's body to &quot;slough away into foul corruption&quot; before turning into hardened blobs of dessicated matter. This event is emotionally devastating for Thig, who had developed a desire to protect Ellen and her children from the potential disease that he witnessed on Earth. Seeing his own comrade become affected by the disease and turn violent has made Thig realize the danger it poses, leading him to take drastic measures to ensure the safety of Ellen and her children. The emotional impact of this event on Thig is not explicitly stated in the story, but it can be inferred that he experiences horror, guilt, and a sense of urgency to protect others from the disease." />
    <node id="The discovery of an &quot;ideal world&quot; and an encounter with a creature that resembles him could symbolize new ideas and perspectives for Lewis Terry, who is experiencing writer's block. Throughout the story, Lewis is accustomed to writing about familiar territories such as the untamed West and the frigid desolation of the Northwoods. However, his encounter with Thig and the discovery of an &quot;ideal world&quot; could represent new inspiration for his writing, challenging his existing assumptions and mental barriers that prevent him from expressing himself creatively.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Thig resembles Lewis may suggest that he sees a part of himself in the alien creature, possibly sparking a sense of curiosity and fascination that could help stimulate his creativity. This discovery could also represent an opportunity for personal growth and transformation for Lewis as he grapples with the implications of this encounter and what it means for his writing.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the discovery of an &quot;ideal world&quot; and an encounter with a creature resembling himself could be a transformative experience for Lewis Terry, inspiring new ideas and perspectives that can help overcome his writer's block and lead to personal growth and transformation." />
    <node id="1. The man's hasty departure towards the spaceship is due to his realization that he is an alien from outer space and needs to return to his world, Ortha. This sudden understanding comes after Thig's actions on Earth, where he inadvertently caused harm to Kam and Torp due to the pernicious disease present on Planet 72-P-3. The unspoken trouble could be related to the man's writer's block or personal issues that he is grappling with as he contemplates a new epic of the west. However, his urgent need to leave Earth stems from his desire to protect Ellen and her children by preventing their exposure to the deadly disease on 72-P-3." />
    <node id="The pernicious disease present on Planet 72-P-3 is a brain disorder that causes violent insanity. This was discovered when Thig, who had surveyed the planet, returned and unintentionally killed Kam due to the effects of the disease. Thig then felt &quot;the insidious virus&quot; of this disease, prompting him to take immediate action to protect Ellen (the Earthwoman) and her children from being exposed to it. He set the automatic pilot for the planet Ortha and cut free from the mother vessel to ensure that he could deliver a warning about the danger on 72-P-3. The urgency of his actions suggests that the disease has rapid onset and devastating effects, as Torp also showed signs of violent insanity soon after Thig." />

    <node id="1. The Orthan, named Thig, is on Earth to assess the planet's suitability for colonization by his people, the Hordes of Ortha. They are seeking information about the planet's resources, temperatures, and other factors that would determine its habitability for their civilization. Thig is specifically tasked with bringing back a native for examination, which involves draining their mentality of all its knowledge to learn about the planet.&#10;2. However, Thig's experiences on Earth and his interactions with humans have led him to question the Orthan way of life and their single-minded devotion to the Horde. He is hesitant to recommend the destruction of the human civilization on Earth for colonization. This internal conflict highlights the cultural differences between the Orthans and humans, adding complexity to Thig's mission." />
    <node id="The story does not explicitly provide information about Thig questioning Torp's decision to recommend the conquest and destruction of all biped life on planet 72-P-3. However, it is possible to infer some potential reasons based on Thig's character development and actions throughout the story.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Thig has developed a sense of empathy and concern for individual beings, particularly Ellen and her children, which contrasts with the Horde's usual approach of valuing order and efficiency over individual lives. This newfound emotional perspective may make Thig question the morality of destroying an entire planet's biped life, even if they are considered &quot;barbaric&quot; or &quot;unfit for colonization.&quot;&#10;&#10;Secondly, Thig has witnessed firsthand the rapid onset and devastating effects of the pernicious disease present on 72-P-3. He may question whether it is necessary to destroy all biped life on the planet, rather than finding a way to contain or cure the disease.&#10;&#10;Finally, Thig's decision to cut free an auxiliary lifeboat and set a course for Ortha suggests that he values individual autonomy and agency. He may question whether it is right for Torp to make a unilateral decision to destroy all biped life on 72-P-3 without considering alternative perspectives or approaches.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not explicitly provide information about Thig questioning Torp's decision, it is possible to infer that his character development and experiences on Earth may lead him to question the morality and necessity of the Horde's usual approach to colonization." />
    <node id="72-P-3 is unfit for colonization due to a deadly disease that affects the brain centers and causes violent insanity. This was discovered when Thig, who had surveyed the planet, returned and accidentally killed Kam due to the effects of the disease. Feeling the insidious virus of this disease, Thig realized that the Earthwoman (Ellen) and her children were at risk if they traveled there. To protect them, he decided to prevent their exposure to the disease by setting the automatic pilot for Ortha and cutting free in an auxiliary life boat. This way, he could deliver a warning about the danger on 72-P-3 while ensuring that Ellen and her children would not be endangered." />
    <node id="1. The thrilling emotion that Thig experiences as he departs from the exploratory ship is a sense of exhilaration and excitement at the prospect of his newfound individuality and freedom. This is a contrast to his previous existence on Ortha, where he led a monotonous and regimented life.&#10;&#10;Reference(s):&#10;Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving him from the parent ship. He thought of many things in those moments, but most of all, he reveled in his newfound independence and autonomy, an exhilaration that was both unfamiliar and intoxicating.&#10;&#10;2. This feeling of exhilaration is also connected to Thig's emotional journey towards individuality, empathy, and compassion, which he has developed during his time on Earth. This represents a departure from the collective and expansionist goals of the Hordes of Ortha, further emphasizing the contrast between his former life on Ortha and his newfound identity as an individual.&#10;&#10;Reference(s):&#10;The emotional journey raises questions about the morality of the Horde's expansionist goals and highlights the value of individuality, empathy, and compassion. Thig's experiences on Earth have challenged his previous perspective, prompting him to question the Orthan way of life." />
    <node id="If the explorer from Ortha, Thig, is not actually encountering an alien creature on a distant planet, it can be inferred from the context that he may be engaged in activities related to his original mission of assessing Earth's suitability for colonization. This might include gathering data about the planet's resources, temperatures, and other factors relevant to Orthan civilization.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Thig's internal conflict between his loyalty to the Hordes of Ortha and his growing appreciation for human culture suggests that he may be spending time reflecting on these cultural differences, questioning his own values, and contemplating the ethical implications of colonization.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Thig's emotional connection with Ellen and her children may lead him to engage in activities that protect or benefit humans, even if it means going against his original mission. This might involve warning humans about potential dangers, sharing knowledge about Orthan technology, or advocating for a more peaceful coexistence between the two civilizations.&#10;&#10;Overall, Thig's actions would likely be driven by his evolving beliefs and values, his loyalty to the Hordes of Ortha, and his concern for both human and Orthan wellbeing." />

    <node id="1. Thig, who had taken on the identity of Lewis Terry, discovered the chest of jewels on the beach while reminiscing about their old treasure hunting adventures. The story doesn't provide many details about how Thig found the chest or its exact contents. However, he planned to use the jewels with Ellen by using them to buy a new trailer and have a rebuilt motor in her car so that they could go on a trip to the west, visiting places like Hollywood and the Grand Canyon. This plan shows that Thig aimed to use the jewels to improve Ellen's living conditions and fulfill her desires as a way to protect and care for her." />
    <node id="Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,&quot; grunted Thig, and gasped.&#10; &#10; For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this way, he realized—more natural.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry I was late,&quot; he said, digging into his pocket for the glittering baubles, &quot;but I was poking around on the beach where we used to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing but a handful of these.&quot;&#10; &#10; He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung, unbelieving, to his arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, Lew,&quot; she gasped, &quot;they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Uh huh,&quot; agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he hoped that the west had reformed.&#10; &#10; &quot;I saved some kraut and weiners,&quot; Ellen" />
    <node id="Thig's recalled memory about the buried treasure and the gleaming baubles he found on the red planet is significant because it gives him an idea of how to present himself to his &quot;barbaric household&quot; after undergoing plastic surgery to change his appearance. He decides to take along some of the valuable jewels he found on Mars as a gift, knowing that they are highly valued by his people. This serves as a strategy for Thig to reintegrate into his society and avoid drawing attention to himself and his mission on Earth. The treasure from his childhood and the baubles from Mars both represent valuable objects that can help Thig navigate his social environment and achieve his goals." />
    <node id=" let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming baubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.&quot;&#10; &#10; An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running inland to his home.&#10; &#10; Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!&#10; &#10; He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from around" />
    <node id="After Thig avenges Kam's death, both Thig and Torp are injured. Thig has collapsed on his face while crawling towards the door with the blaster, and Torp is described as a &quot;crumpled blood-smeared heap of bruised flesh and bone&quot; in the corner of the laboratory. Torp appears to be unconscious or disoriented, as he doesn't seem to react appropriately when Thig crawls towards him with the blaster. Thig shoots Torp &quot;mercifully,&quot; suggesting that Torp is still alive at this point but possibly critically injured. The narrative then shifts to focus on Thig's actions and plans, so there are no further details about Torp's condition." />
    <node id="Thig goes berserk when Kam dismisses the importance of an individual human life compared to the Horde because he has developed a sense of empathy and concern for Ellen and her children, which contrasts with the Horde's usual approach of valuing order and efficiency over individual lives. This emotional connection to humanity, particularly Ellen and her children, drives Thig to prioritize their safety and well-being, leading him to question the morality of destroying an entire planet's biped life.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Thig has witnessed firsthand the rapid onset and devastating effects of the pernicious disease present on 72-P-3. This experience may have made him more cautious about resorting to extreme measures like exterminating all biped life on the planet without considering alternative approaches, such as finding a way to contain or cure the disease.&#10;&#10;Thig's actions and character development throughout the story suggest that he values individual autonomy and agency and questions whether it is right for Torp to make a unilateral decision to destroy all biped life on 72-P-3 without considering alternative perspectives or approaches. Therefore, Kam's dismissive attitude towards an individual human life likely triggers Thig's emotional response, leading him to defend Ellen and her children by any means necessary, even if it means resorting to violence against his own comrade." />
    <node id="The exact reason why Thig was left until last by Torp for disposal through the refuse lock is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, one possible interpretation could be that Torp wanted to take cultures of Thig's blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible for his sudden madness. This theory is supported by the fact that Thig had just killed Kam and displayed erratic behavior himself, suggesting that there might have been some contagious disease affecting their mental stability. Additionally, the passage mentions that &quot;the body of Kam was gone,&quot; indicating that Torp had already disposed of Kam's body before Thig regained consciousness. Therefore, it is plausible that Torp planned to examine Thig's body for signs of illness before disposing of it." />
    <node id="1. The Orthan, Thig, initially perceives human civilization as stagnant, likely due to the Hordes of Ortha's emphasis on constant growth and expansion. However, as he spends more time on Earth, he begins to appreciate its beauty, forms emotional bonds with humans, and develops empathy for their lives. This contrasts sharply with the Horde's collective goals and leads Thig to challenge his previous perspective on humanity's stagnation.&#10;&#10;Reference(s):&#10;Thig's interactions with the human woman Ellen and her sick child, as well as his emotional experiences of Earth's beauty, contribute to this shift in perspective. These personal experiences help him see individuality, empathy, and compassion as valuable aspects of civilization.&#10;&#10;The story suggests that Thig's growing appreciation for human culture makes him question the Horde's relentless pursuit of growth and power. His emotional journey raises questions about the morality of the Horde's expansionist goals and highlights the value of individuality, empathy, and compassion. This internal conflict indicates a significant change in Thig's perspective on humanity's &quot;stagnation.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, the Orthan's perspective on human civilization evolves as he develops emotional connections and forms a newfound appreciation for individuality, empathy, and compassion. These experiences challenge his original view of humanity as stagnant, highlighting the importance of personal growth and understanding in cross-cultural interactions." />
    <node id="Thig's feelings upon returning home, as conveyed through Ellen's observation, suggest a strong sense of nostalgia and happiness to be back in his familiar surroundings. The beauty of &quot;our own little strip of sky and water&quot; highlights Thig's appreciation for the simple pleasures of home after his extensive travels. This sentimentality indicates that Thig values the time he spent away, but is ultimately glad to be back at Ellen's place, reflecting his emotional bond with her and her family." />
    <node id=" his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he hoped that the west had reformed.&#10; &#10; &quot;I saved some kraut and weiners,&quot; Ellen said. &quot;Get washed up while I'm warming them up.

Want coffee, too?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mmmmmm,&quot; came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Home again,&quot; whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.&#10; &#10; &quot;The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,&quot; she went on as they climbed the steps, &quot;but nowhere was there any place as beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.&quot;&#10; &#10; Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the chaos of his cool Orthan brain.&#10; &#10; Tonight" />
    <node id=" and slept—the son of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.&#10; &#10; Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the road toward the beach.&#10; &#10; The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the door and called after him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hurry home, dear,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.&quot;&#10; &#10; He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.&#10; &#10; Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that lived no longer. He mentally titled it: &quot;Rustlers' Riot&quot; and blocked in the outlines of his plot. One" />

Thig shoots Torp &quot;mercifully,&quot; suggesting that Torp is still alive at this point but possibly critically injured.&#10;&#10;Thig's aggressive behavior towards Torp was triggered by a combination of factors. First, seeing the cases of fragile instruments above his head reminded him of the heavy blaster in its rack beneath them, leading him to feel the weapon and tug it free. Second, while crawling towards the door with the blaster, Thig collapsed on his face, causing Torp to cry out in surprise, which likely added to his confusion and madness. Finally, Thig's rigidly trained brain had been shocked by the sight of his commander, a man he had killed and who was now apparently alive again, combined with the thought of protecting Ellen and the children, leading him to shoot Torp &quot;mercifully.&quot;&#10;&#10;Therefore, it was a combination of Thig's suspicion towards Torp, his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and the shock of seeing the man he had killed come back to life that triggered his attempt to attack Torp." />

Thig's role is crucial in this plan, but his behavior becomes a concern when he deviates from the plan by deciding to protect Ellen and her children from the potential disease on 72-P-3.&#10;&#10;Thig's behavior is a cause for concern because it shows that he has developed emotions and a sense of empathy towards the Earth woman and her children, which goes against the Orthan way of life and their single-minded devotion to the Horde. Thig's experiences on Earth have led him to question the Orthan way of life, and his decision to protect Ellen and her children could potentially jeopardize the mission and the safety of the Orthan civilization.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Thig's behavior is a cause for concern because it highlights the cultural differences between the Orthans and humans and the potential challenges that may arise from their interactions." />

This experience may have made him more cautious about resorting to extreme measures like exterminating all biped life on the planet without considering alternative approaches, such as finding a way to contain or cure the disease.&#10;&#10;Thig's actions and character development throughout the story suggest that he values individual autonomy and agency and questions whether it is right for Torp to make a unilateral decision to destroy all biped life on 72-P-3 without considering alternative perspectives or approaches. Therefore, Kam's dismissive attitude towards an individual human life likely triggers Thig's emotional response, leading him to defend Ellen and her children by any means necessary, even if it means resorting to violence against his own comrade.">

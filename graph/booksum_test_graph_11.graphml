    <node id="Gabriel Oak's purpose in meeting her on the path was to accompany her home, as he thought it would be safer for her with &quot;bad characters&quot; around. He had initially planned to introduce the topic of Sergeant Troy through this channel, but changed his mind midway as he found it too clumsy and obvious.&#10;&#10;He brought up the topic of &quot;bad characters&quot; in an attempt to subtly warn Bathsheba about the dangers of being alone at night, specifically because Sergeant Troy was one such potential threat. However, she brushed off his concerns, saying that she never encountered such individuals." />
    <node id="An opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short&#10;walk by a path through the neighbouring cornfields.  It was dusk when&#10;Oak, who had not been far a-field that day, took the same path and&#10;met her returning, quite pensively, as he thought.&#10;&#10;The wheat was now tall, and the path was narrow; thus the way was&#10;quite a sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side.&#10;Two persons could not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and&#10;Oak stood aside to let her pass.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, is it Gabriel?&quot; she said.  &quot;You are taking a walk too.&#10;Good-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather late,&quot; said Oak,&#10;turning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat&#10;quickly by him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, indeed, but I am not very fearful.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no; but there are bad characters about.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I never meet them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Now Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going to introduce the&#10;gallant sergeant through the channel of &quot;bad characters.&quot;  But all at&#10;once" />

At any rate she murmured&#10;something to the effect that he might stay if he wished.  She said&#10;more distinctly, &quot;Will you leave me alone now?  I don't order it&#10;as a mistress--I ask it as a woman, and I expect you not to be so&#10;uncourteous as to refuse.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly I will, Miss Everdene,&quot; said Gabriel, gently.  He wondered&#10;that the request should have come at this moment, for the strife was&#10;over, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human&#10;habitation, and the hour was getting late.  He stood still and&#10;allowed her to get far ahead of him till he could only see her form&#10;upon the sky.&#10;&#10;A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that&#10;point now ensued.  A figure apparently rose from the earth beside&#10;her.  The shape beyond all doubt was Troy's.  Oak would not be even" />
    <node id=" Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going to introduce the&#10;gallant sergeant through the channel of &quot;bad characters.&quot;  But all at&#10;once the scheme broke down, it suddenly occurring to him that this&#10;was rather a clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with.  He tried&#10;another preamble.&#10;&#10;&quot;And as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from&#10;home, too--I mean Farmer Boldwood--why, thinks I, I'll go,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, yes.&quot;  She walked on without turning her head, and for many&#10;steps nothing further was heard from her quarter than the rustle&#10;of her dress against the heavy corn-ears.  Then she resumed rather&#10;tartly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood&#10;would naturally come to meet me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I meant on account of the wedding which they say is likely to take&#10;place between you and him, miss.  Forgive my speaking plainly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They say what is not true.&quot; she returned quickly.  &quot;No marriage is&#10;likely to take place between us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel now put forth his unob" />
    <node id="sheba had spoken of her interest in Boldwood with the&#10;greatest freedom to Liddy, but she had only communed with her own&#10;heart concerning Troy.&#10;&#10;All this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled thereby from the&#10;time of his daily journey a-field to the time of his return, and on&#10;to the small hours of many a night.  That he was not beloved had&#10;hitherto been his great sorrow; that Bathsheba was getting into&#10;the toils was now a sorrow greater than the first, and one which&#10;nearly obscured it.  It was a result which paralleled the oft-quoted&#10;observation of Hippocrates concerning physical pains.&#10;&#10;That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the&#10;fear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter&#10;from combating his or her errors.  Oak determined to speak to his&#10;mistress.  He would base his appeal on what he considered her unfair&#10;treatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from home.&#10;&#10;An opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short&#10;walk by a path through the neighbouring cornfields.

Then she jumped up with a manner of&#10;decision, and fetched her desk from a side table.&#10;&#10;In three minutes, without pause or modification, she had written a&#10;letter to Boldwood, at his address beyond Casterbridge, saying mildly&#10;but firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had&#10;brought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon; that&#10;her final decision was that she could not marry him.  She had&#10;expressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood came home before&#10;communicating to him her conclusive reply.  But Bathsheba found that&#10;she could not wait.&#10;&#10;It was impossible to send this letter till the next day; yet to quell&#10;her uneasiness by getting it out of her hands, and so, as it were,&#10;setting the act in motion at once, she arose to take it to any one of&#10;the women who might be in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;She paused in the passage.  A dialogue was going on in the kitchen,&#10;and Bathsheba and Troy were the subject of it.&#10;&#10;&quot;If he marry her, she'll g" />
    <node id="Of the fabricated tastes of good fashionable society she knew but&#10;little, and of the formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all.&#10;Had her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded (and&#10;by herself they never were), they would only have amounted to such a&#10;matter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her&#10;discretion.  Her love was entire as a child's, and though warm as&#10;summer it was fresh as spring.  Her culpability lay in her making&#10;no attempt to control feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into&#10;consequences.  She could show others the steep and thorny way, but&#10;&quot;reck'd not her own rede.&quot;&#10;&#10;And Troy's deformities lay deep down from a woman's vision, whilst&#10;his embellishments were upon the very surface; thus contrasting with&#10;homely Oak, whose defects were patent to the blindest, and whose&#10;virtues were as metals in a mine.&#10;&#10;The difference between love and respect was markedly shown in her&#10;conduct.

    <node id="The realization that Bathsheba, who he saw as a firm and positive girl, has been inconsistent in her actions and decisions, comes as a shock to Boldwood. He had hoped that her firm character would lead her to adhere to a straight course and accept him, even if her fancy didn't flood him with the iridescent hues of uncritical love. But now, his hope is shattered, leaving him stunned and sluggish. This discovery is no less a scourge to him, causing Boldwood to question his assumptions about Bathsheba and leading to disillusionment." />
    <node id=" little aside, he said, &quot;What, are you afraid of&#10;me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should you say that?&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;I fancied you looked so,&quot; said he.  &quot;And it is most strange, because&#10;of its contrast with my feeling for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;She regained self-possession, fixed her eyes calmly, and waited.&#10;&#10;&quot;You know what that feeling is,&quot; continued Boldwood, deliberately.&#10;&quot;A thing strong as death.  No dismissal by a hasty letter affects&#10;that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you did not feel so strongly about me,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;It is&#10;generous of you, and more than I deserve, but I must not hear it&#10;now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hear it?  What do you think I have to say, then?  I am not to marry&#10;you, and that's enough.  Your letter was excellently plain.  I want&#10;you to hear nothing--not I.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for&#10;freeing herself from this fearfully awkward position.  She confusedly&#10;said, &quot;Good evening,&quot; and was moving on." />

I don't trifle with him; but then, I&#10;have nothing to do with him.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood's rival in a wrong&#10;tone to her after all.  &quot;I wish you had never met that young Sergeant&#10;Troy, miss,&quot; he sighed.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic.  &quot;Why?&quot; she asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;He is not good enough for 'ee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did any one tell you to speak to me like this?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nobody at all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not concern us here,&quot;&#10;she said," />
    <node id=" miles of her journey, watching how the&#10;day was retreating, and thinking how the time of deeds was quietly&#10;melting into the time of thought, to give place in its turn to the&#10;time of prayer and sleep, when she beheld advancing over Yalbury&#10;hill the very man she sought so anxiously to elude.  Boldwood was&#10;stepping on, not with that quiet tread of reserved strength which&#10;was his customary gait, in which he always seemed to be balancing&#10;two thoughts.  His manner was stunned and sluggish now.&#10;&#10;Boldwood had for the first time been awakened to woman's privileges&#10;in tergiversation even when it involves another person's possible&#10;blight.  That Bathsheba was a firm and positive girl, far less&#10;inconsequent than her fellows, had been the very lung of his hope;&#10;for he had held that these qualities would lead her to adhere to a&#10;straight course for consistency's sake, and accept him, though her&#10;fancy might not flood him with the iridescent hues of uncritical&#10;love.

    <node id=" sort of maid--mannish?&quot; she continued with some anxiety.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no, not mannish; but so almighty womanish that 'tis getting on&#10;that way sometimes.  Ah! miss,&quot; she said, after having drawn her&#10;breath very sadly in and sent it very sadly out, &quot;I wish I had half&#10;your failing that way.  'Tis a great protection to a poor maid in&#10;these illegit'mate days!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;BLAME--FURY&#10;&#10;&#10;The next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting out of the way&#10;of Mr. Boldwood in the event of his returning to answer her note&#10;in person, proceeded to fulfil an engagement made with Liddy some&#10;few hours earlier.  Bathsheba's companion, as a gauge of their&#10;reconciliation, had been granted a week's holiday to visit her&#10;sister, who was married to a thriving hurdler and cattle-crib-maker&#10;living in a delightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far beyond&#10;Yalbury.  The arrangement was that Miss Everdene should honour&#10;them by coming there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious&#10;contrivances" />
    <node id=" with the low hiss of the leafy trees.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, who had been standing motionless as a model all this&#10;latter time, flung her hands to her face, and wildly attempted to&#10;ponder on the exhibition which had just passed away.  Such astounding&#10;wells of fevered feeling in a still man like Mr. Boldwood were&#10;incomprehensible, dreadful.  Instead of being a man trained to&#10;repression he was--what she had seen him.&#10;&#10;The force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a&#10;circumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming&#10;back to Weatherbury in the course of the very next day or two.  Troy&#10;had not returned to his distant barracks as Boldwood and others&#10;supposed, but had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in Bath,&#10;and had yet a week or more remaining to his furlough.&#10;&#10;She felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at this&#10;nick of time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a fierce quarrel&#10;would be the consequence.  She panted with solicitude when she&#10;thought of possible injury to Troy.  The least" />
    <node id="Bathsheba does not deny Boldwood's accusation that she allowed another man to kiss her. Instead, she admits to it slowly and defiantly, stating that she is &quot;not ashamed to speak the truth.&quot; This response suggests that Bathsheba feels remorseful for her actions and is willing to take responsibility for them, despite the potential consequences. It also indicates a growing sense of assertiveness and independence on Bathsheba's part, as she refuses to be cowed by Boldwood's accusations and stands up for herself. However, her response also highlights the complexity of her character and her struggles with balancing her own desires and societal expectations." />
    <node id=" into any definite groove for&#10;freeing herself from this fearfully awkward position.  She confusedly&#10;said, &quot;Good evening,&quot; and was moving on.  Boldwood walked up to her&#10;heavily and dully.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba--darling--is it final indeed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed it is.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Bathsheba--have pity upon me!&quot; Boldwood burst out. &quot;God's sake,&#10;yes--I am come to that low, lowest stage--to ask a woman for pity!&#10;Still, she is you--she is you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba commanded herself well.  But she could hardly get a clear&#10;voice for what came instinctively to her lips: &quot;There is little&#10;honour to the woman in that speech.&quot;  It was only whispered, for&#10;something unutterably mournful no less than distressing in this&#10;spectacle of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a&#10;passion enervated the feminine instinct for punctilios.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am beyond myself about this, and am mad,&quot; he said.  &quot;I am no stoic&#10;at all to be supplicating here; but I do" />
    <node id=" you--claimed you as&#10;his.  Do you hear--he has kissed you.  Deny it!&quot;&#10;&#10;The most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man, and although Boldwood&#10;was, in vehemence and glow, nearly her own self rendered into another&#10;sex, Bathsheba's cheek quivered.  She gasped, &quot;Leave me, sir--leave&#10;me!  I am nothing to you.  Let me go on!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Deny that he has kissed you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall not.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ha--then he has!&quot; came hoarsely from the farmer.&#10;&#10;&quot;He has,&quot; she said, slowly, and, in spite of her fear, defiantly.  &quot;I&#10;am not ashamed to speak the truth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then curse him; and curse him!&quot; said Boldwood, breaking into a&#10;whispered fury. &quot;Whilst I would have given worlds to touch your hand,&#10;you have let a rake come in without right or ceremony and--kiss you!&#10;Heaven's mercy--kiss you! ...  Ah, a time of his life shall come&#10;when he will have to repent, and think wretchedly of the pain he has" />
    <node id=" say what is not true.&quot; she returned quickly.  &quot;No marriage is&#10;likely to take place between us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for the moment had&#10;come.  &quot;Well, Miss Everdene,&quot; he said, &quot;putting aside what people&#10;say, I never in my life saw any courting if his is not a courting&#10;of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba would probably have terminated the conversation there and&#10;then by flatly forbidding the subject, had not her conscious weakness&#10;of position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better&#10;it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Since this subject has been mentioned,&quot; she said very emphatically,&#10;&quot;I am glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very&#10;common and very provoking.  I didn't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood&#10;anything.  I have never cared for him.  I respect him, and he has&#10;urged me to marry him.  But I have given him no distinct answer.&#10;As soon as he returns I shall do so; and the answer will be that I&#10;cannot think of marrying him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;People are full of mistakes, seemingly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id=" uncritical&#10;love.  But the argument now came back as sorry gleams from a broken&#10;mirror.  The discovery was no less a scourge than a surprise.&#10;&#10;He came on looking upon the ground, and did not see Bathsheba till&#10;they were less than a stone's throw apart.  He looked up at the sound&#10;of her pit-pat, and his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to&#10;her the depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her letter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?&quot; she faltered, a guilty warmth pulsing&#10;in her face.&#10;&#10;Those who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a&#10;means more effective than words.  There are accents in the eye which&#10;are not on the tongue, and more tales come from pale lips than can&#10;enter an ear.  It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter&#10;moods that they avoid the pathway of sound.  Boldwood's look was&#10;unanswerable.&#10;&#10;Seeing she turned a little aside, he said, &quot;What, are you afraid of&#10;me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should you say that?&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Boldwood's reaction to discovering that Bathsheba does not love him and still loves Troy is one of shock, disillusionment, and distress. He had hoped that Bathsheba's firm character would lead her to accept his proposal, even if she didn't feel the same intense love for him as he did for her. However, when he discovers that she has allowed Troy to kiss her and that she still has feelings for the young sergeant, Boldwood is left stunned and sluggish. This discovery causes him to question his assumptions about Bathsheba and leads to a sense of disillusionment and despair." />
    <node id="OT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES&#10;&#10;&#10;Half an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house.  There burnt&#10;upon her face when she met the light of the candles the flush and&#10;excitement which were little less than chronic with her now.  The&#10;farewell words of Troy, who had accompanied her to the very door,&#10;still lingered in her ears.  He had bidden her adieu for two days,&#10;which were, so he stated, to be spent at Bath in visiting some&#10;friends.  He had also kissed her a second time.&#10;&#10;It is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little fact which&#10;did not come to light till a long time afterwards: that Troy's&#10;presentation of himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was&#10;not by any distinctly preconcerted arrangement.  He had hinted--she&#10;had forbidden; and it was only on the chance of his still coming&#10;that she had dismissed Oak, fearing a meeting between them just&#10;then.&#10;&#10;She now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed by all these&#10;new and fevering sequences.  Then she jumped up with a manner of&#10;decision, and fetched her desk" />
    <node id="Bathsheba's response to Boldwood's question about what drew her to him before she knew him is not explicitly stated in the text. However, Boldwood himself suggests that it was a valentine letter she had sent him that first attracted his attention and drew him to her. This letter, which Bathsheba had sent as a playful gesture without any serious intentions, ended up having significant consequences as it ignited feelings of love and devotion in Boldwood that ultimately led to his pursuit of her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's own perspective on this matter is not provided, but she does acknowledge that there was a time when she unintentionally gave Boldwood the impression that she cared for him. She explains that her actions during that time were merely childish games and idle pastimes, rather than deliberate attempts to encourage his affections. Despite this, Boldwood chose to interpret them as signs of her interest in him, leading to his intense feelings of love and devotion.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text suggests that Bathsheba's initial attraction to Boldwood was unintentional and unplanned, while Boldwood's interpretation of her actions and subsequent feelings of love were more deliberate and deeply rooted." />
    <node id=" beyond myself about this, and am mad,&quot; he said.  &quot;I am no stoic&#10;at all to be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you.

In bare human mercy to a lonely man, don't throw me off now!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't throw you off--indeed, how can I?  I never had you.&quot;  In her&#10;noon-clear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment&#10;her thoughtless angle on that day in February.&#10;&#10;&quot;But there was a time when you turned to me, before I thought of you!&#10;I don't reproach you, for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold&#10;darkness that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by&#10;that letter--valentine you call it--would have been worse than my&#10;knowledge of you, though it has brought this misery.

And if you say you gave me no&#10;encouragement, I cannot but contradict you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute.&#10;I have bitterly repented of it--ay, bitterly, and in tears.  Can you&#10;still go on reminding me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't accuse you of it--I deplore it.  I took for earnest what&#10;you insist was jest, and now this that I pray to be jest you say is&#10;awful, wretched earnest.  Our moods meet at wrong places.  I wish&#10;your feeling was more like mine, or my feeling more like yours!  Oh,&#10;could I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going&#10;to lead me into, how I should have cursed you; but only having been&#10;able to see it since, I cannot do that, for I love you too well!

    <node id=" the barn&#10;at the shearing, and that dearest last time in the evening at your&#10;home!  Where are your pleasant words all gone--your earnest hope to&#10;be able to love me?  Where is your firm conviction that you would get&#10;to care for me very much?  Really forgotten?--really?&quot;&#10;&#10;She checked emotion, looked him quietly and clearly in the face, and&#10;said in her low, firm voice, &quot;Mr. Boldwood, I promised you nothing.&#10;Would you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,&#10;highest compliment a man can pay a woman--telling her he loves her?&#10;I was bound to show some feeling, if I would not be a graceless&#10;shrew.  Yet each of those pleasures was just for the day--the day&#10;just for the pleasure.  How was I to know that what is a pastime to&#10;all other men was death to you?  Have reason, do, and think more&#10;kindly of me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, never mind arguing--never mind.  One thing is sure: you&#10;were all but mine, and now you are not nearly mine.  Everything is&#10;changed, and" />
    <node id=" dearest, I am wavering even now between the two opposites&#10;of recklessly renouncing you, and labouring humbly for you again.&#10;Forget that you have said No, and let it be as it was!  Say,&#10;Bathsheba, that you only wrote that refusal to me in fun--come, say&#10;it to me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be untrue, and painful to both of us.  You overrate my&#10;capacity for love.  I don't possess half the warmth of nature you&#10;believe me to have.  An unprotected childhood in a cold world has&#10;beaten gentleness out of me.&quot;&#10;&#10;He immediately said with more resentment: &quot;That may be true,&#10;somewhat; but ah, Miss Everdene, it won't do as a reason!  You are&#10;not the cold woman you would have me believe.  No, no!  It isn't&#10;because you have no feeling in you that you don't love me.  You&#10;naturally would have me think so--you would hide from me that you&#10;have a burning heart like mine.  You have love enough, but it is&#10;turned into a new channel. I know" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, there was no distinct or preconcerted arrangement between Bathsheba and Troy that led to his unexpected appearance. Troy had hinted at meeting her, but Bathsheba had forbidden it. She dismissed Gabriel Oak, fearing a meeting between him and Troy just then, and only on the chance of Troy still coming did she dismiss Oak. This suggests that Bathsheba secretly hoped for Troy's appearance, despite her initial resistance to his hints.&#10;&#10;When Troy does appear, he kisses Bathsheba before departing for two days, which were stated to be spent at Bath visiting friends. The suddenness of Troy's appearance and departure, combined with the public display of affection, leaves Bathsheba feeling wild, perturbed, and full of new and fevering sequences.

She paused, turned,&#10;went back over the hill and half-way to her own door, whence she cast&#10;a farewell glance upon the spot she had just left, having resolved&#10;not to remain near the place after all.&#10;&#10;She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the&#10;rise.

Bathsheba, though she had too much&#10;understanding to be entirely governed by her womanliness, had too&#10;much womanliness to use her understanding to the best advantage.&#10;Perhaps in no minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more than&#10;in the strange power she possesses of believing cajoleries that she&#10;knows to be false--except, indeed, in that of being utterly sceptical&#10;on strictures that she knows to be true.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is difficult to determine Liddy's true beliefs about the rumors concerning Troy, as she appears to be conflicted and afraid of Bathsheba's reaction. When Bathsheba confronts Liddy about the conversation in the kitchen regarding her relationship with Troy, Liddy initially tries to downplay it and avoid giving a direct answer. However, after some prodding from Bathsheba, Liddy eventually admits that she doesn't believe the rumors but is afraid of contradicting them due to potential backlash.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba can determine Liddy's genuine beliefs by continuing to press her and creating a safe space for her to express herself without fear of reprisal. When Liddy begins to cry, Bathsheba comforts her and asks her directly if she believes the rumors about Troy. At this point, Liddy admits that she doesn't believe them, and Bathsheba seems satisfied with her response.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Liddy initially appears hesitant to express her true beliefs due to fear of backlash, Bathsheba is able to determine her genuine feelings by creating a supportive and non-judgmental environment for her to open up in." />

If he were to discover that Bathsheba is in a relationship with another man, it could cause him to react with anger and violence, putting both Bathsheba and Troy in danger.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Boldwood's threats towards Troy further highlight the potential dangers of their relationship being discovered.

    <node id="In the narrative, Sergeant Troy demonstrates four right cuts with his sword. These cuts are described as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Cut one is compared to sowing corn, where Troy moves his sword in a way that creates a rainbow-like arc in the air.&#10;2. Cut two is demonstrated as if he were hedging, using short and precise movements.&#10;3. Cut three is shown as if he were reaping, with long sweeping motions.&#10;4. Cut four is displayed as if he were threshing, making wide and powerful swings.&#10;&#10;Troy mentions that cavalry cuts, such as the ones he demonstrates, are more &quot;swashing&quot; but less interesting than infantry cuts. He explains that infantry cuts are more varied and contain seven different cuts and three thrusts, while cavalry cuts focus on four cuts and four thrusts on each side. Troy's cuts are described as a &quot;firmament of light&quot; with sharp hisses resembling a sky-full of meteors close at hand, creating an exciting atmosphere that leaves Bathsheba both fascinated and fearful for her safety." />

    <node id="Mr. Boldwood's intense emotional reaction is caused by his discovery that Bathsheba does not love him and still has feelings for another man, Sergeant Troy. This realization shatters Boldwood's assumptions about Bathsheba and leads to feelings of shock, disillusionment, and distress. He had hoped that Bathsheba's firm character would lead her to accept his proposal, even if she didn't feel the same intense love for him as he did for her. However, when he discovers that she has allowed Troy to kiss her and that she still has feelings for the young sergeant, Boldwood is left stunned and sluggish.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's response to Boldwood's question about what drew him to her before she knew him suggests that it was a valentine letter she had sent him that first attracted his attention and drew him to her. However, Bathsheba did not intend for the letter to be taken seriously and sees her initial attraction to Boldwood as unintentional and unplanned. In contrast, Boldwood's interpretation of her actions and subsequent feelings of love were more deliberate and deeply rooted.&#10;&#10;As a result of his intense emotional reaction, Boldwood requests that Bathsheba keep Sergeant Troy away from him, fearing the possibility of a &quot;fierce quarrel&quot; between them that could lead to physical violence and harm. The fact that Troy is currently on furlough and planning to return to Weatherbury soon increases the likelihood of their paths crossing, further heightening Bathsheba's anxiety and concern for Troy's safety. Overall, Boldwood's intense emotional reaction and request for Bathsheba to keep someone away from him are rooted in his feelings of love, jealousy, and fear, leading to potential consequences for all parties involved." />
    <node id="Bathsheba's encounter with Troy at the roadside was not the result of a prearranged meeting. Instead, Troy had hinted at meeting her, but Bathsheba had forbidden it.

Despite her initial resistance, Bathsheba secretly hoped he might still appear, which is why she dismissed Oak.

She felt powerless to withstand or deny him.  He was&#10;altogether too much for her, and Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing&#10;a reviving wind, finds it blow so strongly that it stops the breath.&#10;He drew near and said, &quot;I must be leaving you.&quot;&#10;&#10;He drew nearer still.

Oak brought up the topic of &quot;bad characters&quot; in an attempt to subtly warn Bathsheba about the dangers of being alone at night, especially considering that Sergeant Troy could be one such threat. However, she brushed off his concerns, saying that she never encountered such individuals. Oak had marvellous ingenuity and planned to introduce Troy through this channel, but he later deemed it too clumsy and obvious, leading him to try another preamble instead." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba Everdene and Mr. Boldwood do not have a romantic relationship, despite his marriage proposal. Bathsheba has realized that she does not love Mr. Boldwood in the way he loves her, and she has decided to decline his proposal after contemplation. She asserts that she has not definitively promised anything to Mr. Boldwood and will make her declination clear once he returns. Therefore, their relationship is not one of mutual romantic love or commitment, but rather a situation where Mr. Boldwood has strong feelings for Bathsheba, who does not reciprocate those feelings in the same way." />
    <node id="When Sergeant Troy said &quot;Behold now the play&quot; to Bathsheba, he began demonstrating his skill with a sword, transforming the atmosphere into a &quot;firmament of light&quot; with sharp hisses that resembled a sky-full of meteors close at hand.

The fourth cut showed threshing, making wide and powerful swings.&#10;&#10;The atmosphere transformed into a dazzling spectacle of light and sound, captivating Bathsheba's attention while also making her somewhat fearful for her safety. This experience deepened Bathsheba's feelings for Troy, despite her earlier reservations." />
    <node id="Bathsheba's distress is primarily caused by her realization that she does not love Boldwood in the way he loves her and her subsequent decision to decline his marriage proposal. She also experiences anxiety and unease about potentially hurting Boldwood's feelings, as she knows he has been harboring strong feelings for her.&#10;&#10;Liddy is considering leaving Bathsheba because of the tension and discomfort surrounding the rumors about Troy and Bathsheba's relationship with him. Liddy initially tried to downplay her conversation with the other kitchen maids about Bathsheba and Troy, but when pressed by Bathsheba, she admitted that she doesn't believe the rumors but is afraid of contradicting them due to potential backlash. When Bathsheba created a safe space for Liddy to express herself, Liddy felt comfortable admitting her true beliefs, but the situation still made her uncomfortable and anxious. Therefore, she may be considering leaving to avoid further involvement in the situation and potential negative consequences." />

The narrative takes place in a rural English setting and involves the characters Bathsheba, Troy, and Boldwood, among others. There is no mention or allusion to Greek mythology or the Trojan War.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer this question based on the provided narrative.

    <node id="The narrative provided does not mention or allude to the story of Helen, Paris, and Troy from Greek mythology. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer this question based on the given narrative. The narrative only provides context for Bathsheba, Troy, and Boldwood, who are characters in Thomas Hardy's novel &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the context of the provided narrative, there is no direct connection between Helen, Paris, and Troy. Bathsheba, Troy, and Boldwood are not analogous to Helen, Paris, and Menelaus. Therefore, it would be speculative and inaccurate to make assumptions about Helen's feelings based on Bathsheba's situation.&#10;&#10;To answer your question, according to the mythology, Helen experienced regret for allowing Paris to win her affection from the moment she was abducted or eloped with him, depending on the version of the story. There is no mention of her regretting it after they had been together for some time." />
    <node id="The speaker's intense pain is due to Bathsheba rejecting his marriage proposal. He loved Bathsheba deeply and believed that they were close to being together, which makes the denial even harder to bear. Bathsheba's pity for him is significant because it shows her compassion, but according to the speaker, it doesn't compare to her love in alleviating his suffering. Her pity might soothe him a little, but it can't make up for losing the love he deeply desired. Ultimately, the loss of Bathsheba's love and companionship is what causes his deep sorrow, which isn't significantly affected by her pity." />
    <node id="lling to go on like this....  Bathsheba, you&#10;are the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever looked at&#10;to love, and it is the having been so near claiming you for my own&#10;that makes this denial so hard to bear.  How nearly you promised me!&#10;But I don't speak now to move your heart, and make you grieve because&#10;of my pain; it is no use, that.  I must bear it; my pain would get no&#10;less by paining you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I do pity you--deeply--O, so deeply!&quot; she earnestly said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do no such thing--do no such thing.  Your dear love, Bathsheba, is&#10;such a vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as&#10;well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the&#10;gain of your pity make it sensibly less.  O sweet--how dearly you&#10;spoke to me behind the spear-bed at the washing-pool, and in the barn&#10;at the shearing, and that dearest last time in the evening at your&#10;home!

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Bathsheba does not explicitly provide a reason for not loving Boldwood in the text. However, she sends a letter declining his marriage proposal because she realizes that she does not love him in the way he loves her. Boldwood responds to this by feeling intense pain, as he loved Bathsheba deeply and believed they were close to being together. He sees her pity as somewhat soothing but not enough to make up for losing the love he desired. Ultimately, the loss of Bathsheba's love and companionship is what causes his deep sorrow, which isn't significantly affected by her pity." />
    <node id="The ivy growth on the little gallery door is significant because it serves as evidence that the door has not been opened since Troy returned to Weatherbury. This is important because it suggests that Troy has not been entering the church unperceived at the beginning of service, as Bathsheba had mentioned to Gabriel earlier.&#10;&#10;Gabriel had previously thought that the little gallery door was disused and had ascended the external flight of steps to examine it. The fact that he found a sprig of ivy growing across the door, with its delicate tendrils tied to the stone jamb, demonstrates that the door has not been opened for some time.&#10;&#10;This discovery reinforces Bathsheba's earlier statement about Troy's virtuous habit of entering the church unperceived at the beginning of service. It suggests that Troy may not be as religious or virtuous as he had previously claimed, and it raises questions about his true character and motivations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the ivy growth on the little gallery door serves as a symbol of Troy's absence from the church and his potential departure from his supposedly virtuous habits. It also highlights the importance of close observation and attention to detail in uncovering hidden truths and falsehoods." />

The pale lustre yet hanging in the&#10;north-western heaven was sufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had&#10;grown from the wall across the door to a length of more than a foot,&#10;delicately tying the panel to the stone jamb.

    <node id="1. Liddy initially seemed hesitant to express her true beliefs about the rumors regarding Troy due to fear of backlash. However, when Bathsheba created a supportive environment, Liddy admitted that she doesn't believe the rumors about Troy and Bathsheba's relationship.&#10;2. Bathsheba is vehemently defensive of Troy because she has realized her own feelings for Boldwood and declined his proposal. She does not want to hurt Troy's reputation or feelings, as she knows he has been pursuing her. Additionally, Bathsheba values loyalty in her relationships, as evidenced by her asking Liddy to stay with her despite the tension surrounding the rumors about Troy." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is suggested that Boldwood's devotion to Bathsheba before he even knew her was caused by a valentine letter she had sent him. This letter, which Bathsheba had sent as a playful gesture without any serious intentions, ended up having significant consequences as it ignited feelings of love and devotion in Boldwood that ultimately led to his pursuit of her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's own perspective on this matter is not provided in the text, but she does acknowledge that there was a time when she unintentionally gave Boldwood the impression that she cared for him. She explains that her actions during that time were merely childish games and idle pastimes, rather than deliberate attempts to encourage his affections. Despite this, Boldwood chose to interpret them as signs of her interest in him, leading to his intense feelings of love and devotion.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that Bathsheba's initial attraction to Boldwood was unintentional and unplanned, while Boldwood's interpretation of her actions and subsequent feelings of love were more deliberate and deeply rooted. However, the specific reason why Bathsheba's letter had such a significant impact on Boldwood is not explicitly stated in the text." />

However, Boldwood himself suggests that it was a valentine letter she had sent him that first attracted his attention and drew him to her. This letter, which Bathsheba had sent as a playful gesture without any serious intentions, ended up having significant consequences as it ignited feelings of love and devotion in Boldwood that ultimately led to his pursuit of her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's own perspective on this matter is not provided, but she does acknowledge that there was a time when she unintentionally gave Boldwood the impression that she cared for him. She explains that her actions during that time were merely childish games and idle pastimes, rather than deliberate attempts to encourage his affections. Despite this, Boldwood chose to interpret them as signs of her interest in him, leading to his intense feelings of love and devotion.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text suggests that Bathsheba's initial attraction to Boldwood was unintentional and unplanned, while Boldwood's interpretation of her actions and subsequent feelings of love were more deliberate and deeply rooted.">

This is important because it suggests that Troy has not been entering the church unperceived at the beginning of service, as Bathsheba had mentioned to Gabriel earlier.&#10;&#10;Gabriel had previously thought that the little gallery door was disused and had ascended the external flight of steps to examine it. The fact that he found a sprig of ivy growing across the door, with its delicate tendrils tied to the stone jamb, demonstrates that the door has not been opened for some time.&#10;&#10;This discovery reinforces Bathsheba's earlier statement about Troy's virtuous habit of entering the church unperceived at the beginning of service. It suggests that Troy may not be as religious or virtuous as he had previously claimed, and it raises questions about his true character and motivations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the ivy growth on the little gallery door serves as a symbol of Troy's absence from the church and his potential departure from his supposedly virtuous habits. It also highlights the importance of close observation and attention to detail in uncovering hidden truths and falsehoods.">

This red spot is Sergeant Troy, who has hinted at meeting her earlier but whom she had forbidden to come. Despite her initial resistance, Bathsheba secretly hoped he might still appear, which is why she dismissed Oak. When she sees Troy, she decides not to remain near the spot after all, possibly due to the potential danger of being discovered by Boldwood or because of the complicated emotions she experiences around Troy.">

Additionally, Bathsheba is an assertive and independent woman, but she also struggles with balancing her own desires and societal expectations, which adds to her anxiety and unease about sending the letter." target="Mr. Boldwood's intense emotional reaction is caused by his discovery that Bathsheba does not love him and still has feelings for another man, Sergeant Troy. This realization shatters Boldwood's assumptions about Bathsheba and leads to feelings of shock, disillusionment, and distress. He had hoped that Bathsheba's firm character would lead her to accept his proposal, even if she didn't feel the same intense love for him as he did for her. However, when he discovers that she has allowed Troy to kiss her and that she still has feelings for the young sergeant, Boldwood is left stunned and sluggish.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's response to Boldwood's question about what drew him to her before she knew him suggests that it was a valentine letter she had sent him that first attracted his attention and drew him to her. However, Bathsheba did not intend for the letter to be taken seriously and sees her initial attraction to Boldwood as unintentional and unplanned. In contrast, Boldwood's interpretation of her actions and subsequent feelings of love were more deliberate and deeply rooted.&#10;&#10;As a result of his intense emotional reaction, Boldwood requests that Bathsheba keep Sergeant Troy away from him, fearing the possibility of a &quot;fierce quarrel&quot; between them that could lead to physical violence and harm. The fact that Troy is currently on furlough and planning to return to Weatherbury soon increases the likelihood of their paths crossing, further heightening Bathsheba's anxiety and concern for Troy's safety. Overall, Boldwood's intense emotional reaction and request for Bathsheba to keep someone away from him are rooted in his feelings of love, jealousy, and fear, leading to potential consequences for all parties involved.">

However, when he discovers that she has allowed Troy to kiss her and that she still has feelings for the young sergeant, Boldwood is left stunned and sluggish.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's response to Boldwood's question about what drew him to her before she knew him suggests that it was a valentine letter she had sent him that first attracted his attention and drew him to her. However, Bathsheba did not intend for the letter to be taken seriously and sees her initial attraction to Boldwood as unintentional and unplanned. In contrast, Boldwood's interpretation of her actions and subsequent feelings of love were more deliberate and deeply rooted.&#10;&#10;As a result of his intense emotional reaction, Boldwood requests that Bathsheba keep Sergeant Troy away from him, fearing the possibility of a &quot;fierce quarrel&quot; between them that could lead to physical violence and harm. The fact that Troy is currently on furlough and planning to return to Weatherbury soon increases the likelihood of their paths crossing, further heightening Bathsheba's anxiety and concern for Troy's safety. Overall, Boldwood's intense emotional reaction and request for Bathsheba to keep someone away from him are rooted in his feelings of love, jealousy, and fear, leading to potential consequences for all parties involved." target="Bathsheba's feelings and actions towards Mr. Boldwood have changed due to her realization that she does not love him in the way he loves her. She had not given him a distinct answer regarding his marriage proposal, but after some contemplation, she decides to send a letter declining his proposal. This change is likely caused by Bathsheba's growing awareness of her own feelings and desires, as well as her struggles with balancing societal expectations and her independent nature. Furthermore, Bathsheba has also admitted to allowing another man (Sergeant Troy) to kiss her, which might have contributed to her decision not to marry Boldwood.">

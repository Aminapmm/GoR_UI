But another footstep had caught the lover's ear, and he&#10;was already nearly beyond the sound of the girl's silvery voice. Still&#10;Hetty, bent only on her own thoughts and purposes, continued to speak,&#10;though the gentleness of her tones prevented the sounds from penetrating&#10;far into the woods. On the water they were more widely diffused.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here I am, Judith,&quot; she added, &quot;and there is no one near me. The Huron&#10;on watch has gone to meet his sweetheart, who is an Indian girl you&#10;know, and never had a Christian mother to tell her how wrong it is to&#10;meet a man at night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty's voice was hushed by a &quot;Hist!&quot; that came from the water, and then&#10;she caught a dim view of the canoe, which approached noiselessly, and&#10;soon grated on the shingle with its bow.

    <node id=" in the light craft the canoe withdrew, stern foremost, as if&#10;possessed of life and volition, until it was a hundred yards from the&#10;shore. Then it turned and, making a wide sweep, as much to prolong the&#10;passage as to get beyond the sound of voices, it held its way towards&#10;the ark. For several minutes nothing was uttered; but, believing herself&#10;to be in a favourable position to confer with her sister, Judith, who&#10;alone sat in the stern, managing the canoe with a skill little short of&#10;that of a man, began a discourse which she had been burning to commence&#10;ever since they had quitted the point.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here we are safe, Hetty,&quot; she said, &quot;and may talk without the fear of&#10;being overheard. You must speak low, however, for sounds are heard far&#10;on the water in a still night. I was so close to the point some of the&#10;time while you were on it, that I have heard the voices of the warriors,&#10;and I heard your shoes on the gravel of the beach, even before you&#10;spoke.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't believe, Judith, the Hurons know I have left them.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="moved away to go home. You know we often move the ark in the night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is true, Hetty, and it must be as you suppose. There is a little&#10;more southern air than there was, and they have gone up the lake--&quot;&#10;Judith stopped, for, as the last word was on her tongue, the scene was&#10;suddenly lighted, though only for a single instant, by a flash. The&#10;crack of a rifle succeeded, and then followed the roll of the echo along&#10;the eastern mountains. Almost at the same moment a piercing female&#10;cry rose in the air in a prolonged shriek. The awful stillness that&#10;succeeded was, if possible, more appalling than the fierce and sudden&#10;interruption of the deep silence of midnight. Resolute as she was both&#10;by nature and habit, Judith scarce breathed, while poor Hetty hid her&#10;face and trembled.&#10;&#10;&quot;That was a woman's cry, Hetty,&quot; said the former solemnly, &quot;and it was&#10;a cry of anguish! If the ark has moved from this spot it can only have&#10;gone north with this air, and the gun and shriek came" />

    <node id=" the beach. Hetty&#10;complied; but as she walked away she spoke aloud in English in her usual&#10;soft tones, which the stillness of the night made audible at some little&#10;distance.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you took me for a Huron girl, warrior,&quot; she said, &quot;I don't wonder&#10;you are so little pleased. I am Hetty Hutter, Thomas Hutter's daughter,&#10;and have never met any man at night, for mother always said it was&#10;wrong, and modest young women should never do it; modest young women of&#10;the pale-faces, I mean; for customs are different in different parts&#10;of the world, I know. No, no; I'm Hetty Hutter, and wouldn't meet even&#10;Hurry Harry, though he should fall down on his knees and ask me! Mother&#10;said it was wrong.&quot;&#10;&#10;By the time Hetty had said this, she reached the place where the canoes&#10;had come ashore, and, owing to the curvature of the land and the bushes,&#10;would have been completely hid from the sight of the sentinel, had it&#10;been broad day. But another footstep had caught the lover's ear, and he" />
    <node id=" times the sisters fancied they&#10;saw it, looming up in the obscurity, like a low black rock; but on each&#10;occasion it was found to be either an optical illusion, or some swell of&#10;the foliage on the shore. After a search that lasted half an hour, the&#10;girls were forced to the unwelcome conviction that the ark had departed.&#10;Most young women would have felt the awkwardness of their situation,&#10;in a physical sense, under the circumstances in which the sisters were&#10;left, more than any apprehensions of a different nature. Not so with&#10;Judith, however; and even Hetty felt more concern about the motives that&#10;might have influenced her father and Hurry, than any fears for her own&#10;safety.&#10;&#10;&quot;It cannot be, Hetty,&quot; said Judith, when a thorough search had satisfied&#10;them both that no ark was to be found; &quot;it cannot be that the Indians&#10;have rafted, or swum off and surprised our friends as they slept?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't believe that Hist and Chingachgook would sleep until they had&#10;told each other all they had to say after so long a separation--do you,&#10;sister?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="1. The canoe moved northerly as the girls rested.&#10;2. This motion was caused by the canoe drifting naturally with the help of the gentle current or wind from the north while the girls were resting and not paddling." />
    <node id="a cry of anguish! If the ark has moved from this spot it can only have&#10;gone north with this air, and the gun and shriek came from the point.&#10;Can any thing have befallen Hist?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us go and see, Judith; she may want our assistance--for, besides&#10;herself, there are none but men in the ark.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was not a moment for hesitation, and ere Judith had ceased speaking&#10;her paddle was in the water. The distance to the point, in a direct&#10;line, was not great, and the impulses under which the girls worked were&#10;too exciting to allow them to waste the precious moments in useless&#10;precautions. They paddled incautiously for them, but the same excitement&#10;kept others from noting their movements. Presently a glare of light&#10;caught the eye of Judith through an opening in the bushes, and steering&#10;by it, she so directed the canoe as to keep it visible, while she got as&#10;near the land as was either prudent or necessary.&#10;&#10;The scene that was now presented to the observation of the girls was&#10;within the woods, on the side of the declivity so often mentioned, and&#10;in plain" />
    <node id=" glance. The streak of light had&#10;appeared on the water a short distance from the point, and either the&#10;rifle had been discharged from a canoe hovering near the land, or it had&#10;been fired from the ark in passing. An incautious exclamation, or laugh,&#10;may have produced the assault, for it was barely possible that the aim&#10;had been assisted by any other agent than sound. As to the effect, that&#10;was soon still more apparent, the head of the victim dropping, and the&#10;body sinking in death. Then all the torches but one were extinguished--a&#10;measure of prudence; and the melancholy train that bore the body to the&#10;camp was just to be distinguished by the glimmering light that remained.&#10;Judith sighed heavily and shuddered, as her paddle again dipped, and&#10;the canoe moved cautiously around the point. A sight had afflicted her&#10;senses, and now haunted her imagination, that was still harder to be&#10;borne, than even the untimely fate and passing agony of the deceased&#10;girl.&#10;&#10;She had seen, under the strong glare of all the torches, the erect form&#10;of Deerslayer, standing with commiseration, and as she" />
    <node id="&#10;She had seen, under the strong glare of all the torches, the erect form&#10;of Deerslayer, standing with commiseration, and as she thought, with&#10;shame depicted on his countenance, near the dying female. He betrayed&#10;neither fear nor backwardness himself; but it was apparent by the&#10;glances cast at him by the warriors, that fierce passions were&#10;struggling in their bosoms. All this seemed to be unheeded by the&#10;captive, but it remained impressed on the memory of Judith throughout&#10;the night. No canoe was met hovering near the point. A stillness and&#10;darkness, as complete as if the silence of the forest had never been&#10;disturbed, or the sun had never shone on that retired region, now&#10;reigned on the point, and on the gloomy water, the slumbering woods,&#10;and even the murky sky. No more could be done, therefore, than to seek&#10;a place of safety; and this was only to be found in the centre of the&#10;lake. Paddling in silence to that spot, the canoe was suffered to drift&#10;northerly, while the girls sought such repose as their situation and&#10;feelings would" />
    <node id="Hetty Hutter wakes up at midnight due to the activity of her &quot;immaterial portion of existence,&quot; or mind, which is strong enough to rouse her body even without a physical sentinel standing guard over her. The narrative suggests that this occurrence is influenced by thought over matter, although the exact mechanism remains mysterious. Hetty's purpose for waking up and stirring the fire appears to be due to the coolness of the night, as she seems to be unaware of the Huron on watch initially. Her movements are natural and open, which makes the sentinel less suspicious about her intentions." />
    <node id=" sooner on the pillow than consciousness&#10;is lost; and yet, at a necessary hour, the mind appears to arouse the&#10;body, as promptly as if it had stood sentinel the while over it. There&#10;can be no doubt that they who are thus roused awake by the influence&#10;of thought over matter, though the mode in which this influence is&#10;exercised must remain hidden from our curiosity until it shall be&#10;explained, should that hour ever arrive, by the entire enlightenment of&#10;the soul on the subject of all human mysteries. Thus it was with Hetty&#10;Hutter. Feeble as the immaterial portion of her existence was thought&#10;to be, it was sufficiently active to cause her to open her eyes at&#10;midnight. At that hour she awoke, and leaving her bed of skin and boughs&#10;she walked innocently and openly to the embers of the fire, stirring the&#10;latter, as the coolness of the night and the woods, in connection with&#10;an exceedingly unsophisticated bed, had a little chilled her. As the&#10;flame shot up, it lighted the swarthy countenance of the Huron on watch,&#10;whose dark eyes glistened under its light like the" />
    <node id="&#10;flame shot up, it lighted the swarthy countenance of the Huron on watch,&#10;whose dark eyes glistened under its light like the balls of the panther&#10;that is pursued to his den with burning brands. But Hetty felt no fear,&#10;and she approached the spot where the Indian stood. Her movements&#10;were so natural, and so perfectly devoid of any of the stealthiness of&#10;cunning or deception, that he imagined she had merely arisen on account&#10;of the coolness of the night, a common occurrence in a bivouac, and the&#10;one of all others, perhaps, the least likely to excite suspicion. Hetty&#10;spoke to him, but he understood no English. She then gazed near a minute&#10;at the sleeping captive, and moved slowly away in a sad and melancholy&#10;manner. The girl took no pains to conceal her movements. Any ingenious&#10;expedient of this nature quite likely exceeded her powers; still&#10;her step was habitually light, and scarcely audible. As she took the&#10;direction of the extremity of the point, or the place where she had&#10;landed in the first adventure, and where Hist had embarked, the sentinel&#10;saw her light" />
    <node id=" the gravel he approached&#10;swiftly, though with anything but menace in his manner. The darkness was&#10;so intense that it was not easy to discover forms within the shadows&#10;of the woods at the distance of twenty feet, and quite impossible to&#10;distinguish persons until near enough to touch them. The young Huron&#10;manifested disappointment when he found whom he had met; for, truth to&#10;say, he was expecting his favourite, who had promised to relieve the&#10;ennui of a midnight watch with her presence. This man was also ignorant&#10;of English, but he was at no loss to understand why the girl should be&#10;up at that hour. Such things were usual in an Indian village and camp,&#10;where sleep is as irregular as the meals. Then poor Hetty's known&#10;imbecility, as in most things connected with the savages, stood her&#10;friend on this occasion. Vexed at his disappointment, and impatient of&#10;the presence of one he thought an intruder, the young warrior signed&#10;for the girl to move forward, holding the direction of the beach. Hetty&#10;complied; but as she walked away she spoke aloud in English in her usual&#10;soft tones, which the stillness of" />
    <node id="The Huron chief Rivenoak's plan for the white captive, named Hawkeye, is to have him go back to Hutter's cabin, also known as the Muskrat, and pretend to be a friend. Hawkeye should eat Hutter's food, laugh and talk with his daughters, and create a thick fog in Hutter's eyes, making it hard for him to see. During this time, when everyone is disoriented, Hawkeye should set a torch as a signal, open the door, and let in the Hurons to kill them all. Rivenoak believes that Hawkeye cannot be purely white because of his actions and feelings, which align more with the Huron way of life." />

Why, Hawkeye, will carry&#10;away the most, and the Hurons will take what he may choose to leave&#10;behind him. The scalps can go to Canada, for a pale-face has no&#10;satisfaction in them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well, Rivenoak--for so I hear 'em tarm you--This is plain&#10;English, enough, though spoken in Iroquois. I understand all you mean,&#10;now, and must say it out-devils even Mingo deviltry! No doubt, 'twould&#10;be easy enough to go back and tell the Muskrat that I had got away from&#10;you, and gain some credit, too, by the expl'ite.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good. That is what I want the pale-face to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--yes--That's plain enough. I know what you want me to do, without&#10;more words.

He is an acquaintance of the Muskrat,&quot; this was the name by&#10;which all the Indians designated Hutter--&quot;and has lived in his wigwam.&#10;But he is not a friend. He wants no scalps, like a miserable Indian, but&#10;fights like a stout-hearted pale-face. The Muskrat is neither white, nor&#10;red. Neither a beast nor a fish. He is a water snake; sometimes in the&#10;spring and sometimes on the land. He looks for scalps, like an outcast.&#10;Hawkeye can go back and tell him how he has outwitted the Hurons, how he&#10;has escaped, and when his eyes are in a fog, when he can't see as far&#10;as from his cabin to the shore, then Hawkeye can open the door for the&#10;Hurons.

My friend has come here on account of a little string&#10;held by a girl, that can pull the whole body of the sternest warrior?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are nearer the truth, now, Huron, than you've been afore, since we&#10;began to talk. This is true. But one end of that string was not fast to&#10;my heart, nor did the Wild Rose hold the other.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is wonderful! Does my brother love in his head, and not in his&#10;heart? And can the Feeble Mind pull so hard against so stout a warrior?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There it is ag'in; sometimes right, and sometimes wrong! The string you&#10;mean is fast to the heart of a great Delaware; one of Mohican stock in&#10;fact, living among the Delawares since the disparsion of his own people,&#10;and of the family of Uncas--Chingachgook by name, or Great Sarpent.&#10;He has come here, led by the" />

He is not born their&#10;enemy, and the death of one warrior will not cast a cloud between them&#10;forever.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So much the better, Huron; so much the better.

Hawkeye should have been born a Huron! His blood is not more than&#10;half white!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There you're out, Huron; yes, there you're as much out, as if you&#10;mistook a wolf for a catamount. I'm white in blood, heart, natur' and&#10;gifts, though a little red-skin in feelin's and habits. But when old&#10;Hutter's eyes are well befogged, and his pretty darters perhaps in a&#10;deep sleep, and Hurry Harry, the Great Pine as you Indians tarm him, is&#10;dreaming of any thing but mischief, and all suppose Hawkeye is acting as&#10;a faithful sentinel, all I have to do is set a torch somewhere in sight&#10;for a signal, open the door, and let in the Hurons, to knock 'em all on&#10;the head.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Surely my brother is mistaken.

    <node id="The speaker, Uncas, expresses a negative view of using deceit and treachery among friends.

Furthermore, he distinguishes between white men and himself by asserting that whites might forget their &quot;Manitou&quot; (a term for spiritual power or god) and their racial identity if they engage in treacherous behavior. This suggests that Uncas believes white men who resort to deceit and treachery are betraying their own cultural and moral values." />

Recollect now, well, Hetty, for&#10;this is a most awful and serious thing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes he did; and I remember it by your speaking about my tormenting you.&#10;Oh! I felt very sorry for him, and Deerslayer took all so quietly and&#10;without noise!

I care as little for the Muskrat,&#10;as one pale-face ought to care for another, but I care too much for him&#10;to ambush him in the way you wished. In short, according to my idees,&#10;any sarcumventions, except open-war sarcumventions, are ag'in both law,&#10;and what we whites call 'gospel', too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My pale-face brother is right; he is no Indian, to forget his Manitou&#10;and his colour. The Hurons know that they have a great warrior for their&#10;prisoner, and they will treat him as one.

As soon as Rivenoak perceived the girl, she was recognised,&#10;and calling to two or three of the younger warriors, the chief sent&#10;them out to reconnoitre, lest her appearance should be the forerunner of&#10;another attack. He then motioned to Hetty to draw near.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope your visit is a sign that the Sarpent and Hist are in safety,&#10;Hetty,&quot; said Deerslayer, as soon as the girl had complied with the&#10;Huron's request. &quot;I don't think you'd come ashore ag'in, on the arr'nd&#10;that brought you here afore.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Judith told me to come this time, Deerslayer,&quot; Hetty replied, &quot;she&#10;paddled me ashore herself, in a canoe, as soon as the Serpent had shown" />

It was now too late to assail the other fugitives, for&#10;no sooner was his friend led into the bushes than the Delaware placed&#10;his paddle into the water, and the light canoe glided noiselessly away,&#10;holding its course towards the centre of the lake until safe from shot,&#10;after which it sought the Ark. When Deerslayer reached the fire, he&#10;found himself surrounded by no less than eight grim savages, among&#10;whom was his old acquaintance Rivenoak. As soon as the latter caught a&#10;glimpse of the captive's countenance, he spoke apart to his companions,&#10;and a low but general exclamation of pleasure and surprise escaped them.&#10;They knew that the conqueror of their late friend, he who had fallen on&#10;the opposite side of the lake, was in their hands, and subject to their&#10;mercy, or vengeance.

The old woman withdrew, but the hunter well&#10;understood that he was to be the subject of all her means of annoyance,&#10;if not of positive injury, so long as he remained in the power of his&#10;enemies, for nothing rankles so deeply as the consciousness that an&#10;attempt to irritate has been met by contempt, a feeling that is usually&#10;the most passive of any that is harbored in the human breast. Rivenoak&#10;quietly took the seat we have mentioned, and, after a short pause, he&#10;commenced a dialogue, which we translate as usual, for the benefit of&#10;those readers who have not studied the North American languages.&#10;&#10;&quot;My pale-face friend is very welcome,&quot; said the Indian, with a familiar&#10;nod, and a smile so covert that it required all Deerslayer's vigilance&#10;to detect, and not a little of his philosophy to detect unmoved; &quot;he is&#10;welcome.

This restraint could be attributed to his prudence and awareness that an enemy's death might not be the best course of action in this situation.&#10;   &#10;2. Instead of firing at his pursuer, Deerslayer disappeared in the cover of bushes and made his way towards the beach where Chingachgook and Hist were waiting in the canoe. He laid his rifle in the bottom of the canoe and prepared to shove off from the shore.&#10;&#10;3. At this moment, a powerful Indian leaped through the bushes, landing on Deerslayer's back. This sudden attack was likely due to the pursuing party having heard the commotion caused by Deerslayer and his companions but being unable to immediately locate them. The Indian attacker sought to take advantage of an opportune moment.&#10;&#10;4. By choosing not to fire at his pursuer and instead disappearing in the cover, Deerslayer may have been trying to avoid further conflict and protect the lives of those around him. His actions demonstrate a preference for non-violent resolution when possible and highlight his cautious nature." />

Four dark figures loomed on the ridge, drawn against the&#10;brightness of the fire, and an enemy might have been sacrificed at a&#10;glance. The Indians had paused to gaze into the gloom, in search of the&#10;screeching hag, and with many a man less given to reflection than the&#10;hunter, the death of one of them would have been certain. Luckily he was&#10;more prudent. Although the rifle dropped a little towards the foremost&#10;of his pursuers, he did not aim or fire, but disappeared in the&#10;cover. To gain the beach, and to follow it round to the place where&#10;Chingachgook was already in the canoe, with Hist, anxiously waiting his&#10;appearance, occupied but a moment.

With a generosity that would have rendered a Roman&#10;illustrious throughout all time, but which, in the career of one so&#10;simple and humble, would have been forever lost to the world but&#10;for this unpretending legend, Deerslayer threw all his force into a&#10;desperate effort, shoved the canoe off with a power that sent it a&#10;hundred feet from the shore, as it might be in an instant, and fell&#10;forward into the lake, himself, face downward; his assailant necessarily&#10;following him.&#10;&#10;Although the water was deep within a few yards of the beach, it was not&#10;more than breast high, as close in as the spot where the two combatants&#10;fell. Still this was quite sufficient to destroy one who had sunk, under&#10;the great disadvantages in which Deerslayer was placed.

What might have been the issue of this severe personal&#10;struggle cannot be known, for half a dozen savages came leaping into&#10;the water to the aid of their friend, and Deerslayer yielded himself a&#10;prisoner, with a dignity that was as remarkable as his self-devotion.&#10;&#10;To quit the lake and lead their new captive to the fire occupied the&#10;Indians but another minute. So much engaged were they all with the&#10;struggle and its consequences, that the canoe was unseen, though it&#10;still lay so near the shore as to render every syllable that was uttered&#10;perfectly intelligible to the Delaware and his betrothed; and the whole&#10;party left the spot, some continuing the pursuit after Hist, along the&#10;beach, though most proceeded to the light.

That some such course was&#10;now adopted he believed from the tramp of feet, which not only came up&#10;the ascent, as related, but were also heard, under the first impulse,&#10;diverging not only towards the hill in the rear, but towards the&#10;extremity of the point, in a direction opposite to that he was about&#10;to take himself. Promptitude, consequently became a matter of the last&#10;importance, as the parties might meet on the strand, before the fugitive&#10;could reach the canoe.&#10;&#10;Notwithstanding the pressing nature of the emergency, Deerslayer&#10;hesitated a single instant, ere he plunged into the bushes that lined&#10;the shore.

The only precaution&#10;that was taken to secure his person was untiring watchfulness, and a&#10;strong rope of bark that passed from ankle to ankle, not so much&#10;to prevent his walking, as to place an obstacle in the way of his&#10;attempting to" />

However, Judith disagrees and finds Hurry to be only plain, while Deerslayer has a more honest face that she considers handsomer than any man's good looks.

She is particularly incensed that Deerslayer only killed the warrior when his spirit was not present, and she believes that his actions have brought shame upon him.

He also knows that vulgarity and mendacity only affect those who use them, and he sees no need to respond to her attacks.&#10;&#10;The reason Deerslayer is able to remain calm in the face of Shebear's insults is because he possesses qualities that Judith believes make him superior to herself and Hetty. According to Judith, Deerslayer has a significant advantage over them because of his ability to read and his eloquence in speech. Furthermore, Judith recognizes that she and her sister have been better taught, are more comely, and might look higher, but she believes that Deerslayer's truth makes all the difference between them. This sense of moral superiority allows Deerslayer to remain unbothered by Shebear's insults, as he knows that his actions are guided by a strong sense of honor and integrity." />

Meanwhile, Hist's pursuers left the spot, some continuing their pursuit along the beach while most proceeded towards a light.

    <node id="According to the experiences of the Delaware tribe, as described in the narrative, when a young woman has developed feelings for a man, she may exhibit the following signs:&#10;1. Thoughtfulness and preoccupation, with no eyes or ears for anyone else but the warrior who has taken her fancy.&#10;2. Melancholy and sighing.&#10;3. A change in behavior, becoming more secretive or reserved.&#10;4. Increased attention and affection towards the man she has feelings for.&#10;5. If the man is not present, she may become restless or agitated.&#10;6. She may also show signs of jealousy if she sees the man paying attention to other women.&#10;7. In some cases, she may become protective of the man and aggressive towards his enemies. These signs are described in the narrative through the character of Judith, who has developed feelings for Deerslayer." />

Affecting to smile, he seemed to&#10;listen eagerly, and he then pondered on what he had heard.&#10;&#10;&quot;Does Hawkeye love the Muskrat?&quot; he abruptly demanded; &quot;Or does he love&#10;his daughters?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Neither, Mingo.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the unnamed young Indian's reactions to the escape of his companion, Hist, can be inferred as a mix of indifference and perhaps mild disappointment. He makes no advances to communicate with Deerslayer or the other women, including Hist, and holds himself aloof from them. This distance, combined with his earlier behavior of passing near the group of younger women without any interaction, suggests that he is not particularly invested in what has happened with Hist's escape.&#10;&#10;Moreover, when Hetty encounters the young warrior during her visit to the camp, he shows no apparent concern or interest in the recent development of Hist's escape. Instead, he appears disappointed that it is Hetty who has approached him and not someone else, suggesting that he was expecting someone more interesting to relieve his boredom during the midnight watch. This reaction further highlights the unnamed young Indian's lack of emotional investment in Hist's situation, as he seems more focused on his own personal interests and entertainment.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the narrative, it can be inferred that the unnamed young Indian feels indifferent towards Hist's escape and is mildly disappointed that she has left the camp, rather than showing any signs of worry or care for her well-being." />

He had held himself aloof from his&#10;friends, even, passing near the bevy of younger women, who were&#10;clustering together, apart as usual, and conversed in low tones on the&#10;subject of the escape of their late companion. Perhaps it would be true&#10;to say that these last were pleased as well as vexed at what had just&#10;occurred.

When Hetty saw him by the fire, she mentioned that he told her he couldn't read, specifically referencing his inability to read the Bible.

    <node id="1. Judith is discussing with Hetty their current situation, the safety of their father and Hurry, and the whereabouts of the ark (the raft) that their father and Hurry are on. She is also expressing her concerns about being equal to Deerslayer, who they believe might be in danger due to his beliefs and values.&#10;2. Judith believes they are safe from being overheard now that they have rowed a considerable distance from the shore because sounds do not carry far on water during a still night. She mentions that she had been close to the point when Hetty was there and could hear the voices of the warriors, as well as Hetty's shoes on the gravel, indicating that sounds can travel far in such conditions." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is suggested that the sisters' friends, who were expected to arrive on an &quot;ark&quot; (which could be a raft or a boat), have possibly moved away from the agreed-upon location without notice. This is indicated by Judith and Hetty's unsuccessful search for half an hour, as well as Judith's worry that the Indians might have surprised their friends while they slept on the ark. &#10;&#10;The text implies that Deerslayer (Judith's potential love interest) and his allies, Chingachgook and Histahkuh, would not have left without informing the sisters or making a sound, especially considering the stillness of the night. This leads Judith to consider the possibility of their abrupt departure due to danger from other unidentified Indians.&#10;&#10;In summary, the sisters' friends may have moved away quietly or been taken by surprise by unidentified Indians, although this is not explicitly stated in the text." />

Still we should have heard a noise; for&#10;in a night like this, an oath of Hurry Harry's would have echoed in the&#10;eastern hills like a clap of thunder.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hurry is sinful and thoughtless about his words, Judith,&quot; Hetty meekly&#10;and sorrowfully answered.&#10;&#10;&quot;No--no; 'tis impossible the ark could be taken and I not hear the&#10;noise. It is not an hour since I left it, and the whole time I have been&#10;attentive to the smallest sound. And yet, it is not easy to believe a&#10;father would willingly abandon his children!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps father has thought us in our cabin asleep, Judith, and has&#10;moved away to go home. You know we often move the ark in the night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is true, Hetty, and it" />

Judith was expert in the management of a bark&#10;canoe, the lightness of which demanded skill rather than strength; and&#10;she forced her own little vessel swiftly over the water, the moment she&#10;had ended her conference with Hetty, and had come to the determination&#10;to return.

    <node id="The Huron warriors were both impressed and angered after learning about the whereabouts of the adventurers, Uncas and the Delaware girl. They admired the bravery and success of their enemies but were also resentful of their boldness. After hearing the conversation between Uncas and the Delaware girl, one of the Hurons examined the tree where the adventurers were hiding, even looking for footprints around its roots to confirm the story. The Huron chief, Rivenoak, proposed a plan to invite Hawkeye to his cabin, have him open the door for the Hurons, and allow Hawkeye to take most of the plunder, while the Hurons would take what he left behind. The Hurons hoped that this plan would cause discord between the white man and the Delaware tribe." />
    <node id="1. Mingo's pale-face brother, who is referred to as a &quot;hunter&quot; in the narrative, believes that betraying or ambushing their Muskrat friend would be wrong. He considers such actions to be against both law and what whites call &quot;gospel.&quot; This suggests that he holds a strong belief in honesty, loyalty, and adherence to moral and ethical principles, which contrasts with the Hurons' willingness to use deception and violence for their purposes.&#10;2. The pale-face brother also distinguishes between open-war strategies and other forms of subterfuge, indicating that he is not entirely against using tactical advantages in warfare but is opposed to personal betrayal and harming friends.&#10;3. In contrast, the Hurons, represented by Rivenoak, view betraying their enemy as a valid strategy, even if it means deceiving someone who has offered them hospitality. This reflects their belief that the ends justify the means, and their willingness to use any method to achieve their goals, regardless of moral or ethical considerations.&#10;4. Furthermore, Rivenoak questions Hawkeye's loyalty to the Muskrat and his daughters, suggesting that he expects everyone to act based on personal interests rather than principles. This highlights a fundamental difference in values between the pale-face brother and the Hurons.&#10;5. Lastly, the pale-face brother demonstrates respect for the Muskrat as an individual, recognizing both his positive and negative qualities, while the Hurons see him merely as a &quot;water snake&quot; – someone who is neither wholly white nor red but rather an outcast unworthy of respect or loyalty." />
    <node id="Deerslayer, the main character, remains calm and unbothered by the insults of the old woman named Shebear. He considers her insults powerless since they come from an old woman's tongue, and he knows that vulgarity and mendacity only affect those who use them. Deerslayer's sense of moral superiority allows him to remain indifferent to Shebear's attacks.&#10;&#10;Rivenoak, another Huron warrior, saves Deerslayer from further attack by the old woman. When Shebear becomes too aggressive in her insults, Rivenoak intervenes and shoves her aside, telling her to quit the spot. This intervention allows Deerslayer to avoid any further confrontation with Shebear and spares him from any further attacks." />
    <node id="ty listened with great attention, and her mild but speaking&#10;countenance manifested a strong sympathy in the anticipated agony of the&#10;supposititious sufferer. At first she seemed at a loss how to act; then,&#10;taking a hand of Deerslayer's she affectionately recommended to him to&#10;borrow her Bible, and to read it while the savages were inflicting their&#10;torments. When the other honestly admitted that it exceeded his power to&#10;read, she even volunteered to remain with him, and to perform this holy&#10;office in person. The offer was gently declined, and Rivenoak being&#10;about to join them, Deerslayer requested the girl to leave him, first&#10;enjoining her again to tell those in the Ark to have full confidence in&#10;his fidelity. Hetty now walked away, and approached the group of females&#10;with as much confidence and self-possession as if she were a native of&#10;the tribe. On the other hand the Huron resumed his seat by the side&#10;of his prisoner, the one continuing to ask questions with all the wily&#10;ingenuity of a practised Indian counsellor, and the other baffling him&#10;by the very means that are known to be the most efficacious" />
    <node id="Shebear's fury towards Deerslayer was sparked by the fact that he had killed a Delaware warrior, a friend of her tribe. She was particularly incensed that Deerslayer only killed the warrior when his spirit was not present, and she believed that his actions brought shame upon him. This anger was further fueled by the hardships she had long endured as the neglected wife and mother of savages, which made her disposed to revenge herself on all who came within her power." />
    <node id="The direction of the canoe's movement as the girls took a break in their journey was northerly. This was caused by the canoe drifting naturally with the help of the gentle current or wind from the north while the girls were resting and not paddling." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Deerslayer remains calm and unbothered when the Huron warrior assures him of consideration and potential friendship. Deerslayer interprets this as an indication of the Huron's insincerity and recognizes that he might face torture as a captive. Despite feeling fear, he maintains his composure, showing no signs of weakness to his enemy. This response can be attributed to Deerslayer's strong sense of integrity and moral superiority.&#10;&#10;To handle the anticipated torments during captivity, Deerslayer decides not to boast about his ability to withstand pain, as he has never been tested before. Instead, he vows to do his best to endure any suffering without disgracing himself or the people who trained him. This determination showcases his resilience and unwavering spirit in the face of adversity." />
    <node id="torments shall be such as no common man can bear; if he is to be treated&#10;as a friend, it will be the friendship of chiefs.&quot;&#10;&#10;As the Huron uttered this extraordinary assurance of consideration, his&#10;eye furtively glanced at the countenance of his listener, in order to&#10;discover how he stood the compliment, though his gravity and apparent&#10;sincerity would have prevented any man but one practised in artifices,&#10;from detecting his motives. Deerslayer belonged to the class of the&#10;unsuspicious, and acquainted with the Indian notions of what constitutes&#10;respect, in matters connected with the treatment of captives, he felt&#10;his blood chill at the announcement, even while he maintained an aspect&#10;so steeled that his quick sighted enemy could discover in it no signs of&#10;weakness.&#10;&#10;&quot;God has put me in your hands, Huron,&quot; the captive at length answered,&#10;&quot;and I suppose you will act your will on me. I shall not boast of what&#10;I can do, under torment, for I've never been tried, and no man can say&#10;till he has been; but I'll do my endivours not to disgrace the people&#10;among whom I got my training" />

We have father's chest in the ark,&#10;Hetty, and might try the temptation of more elephants; though I fear&#10;such baubles will not buy the liberty of a man like Deerslayer. I am&#10;afraid father and Hurry will not be as willing to ransom Deerslayer, as&#10;Deerslayer was to ransom them!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not, Judith? Hurry and Deerslayer are friends, and friends should&#10;always help one another.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Alas! poor Hetty, you little know mankind! Seeming friends are often&#10;more to be dreaded than open enemies; particularly by females. But&#10;you'll have to land in the morning, and try again what can be done for&#10;Deerslayer. Tortured he shall not be, while Judith Hutter lives, and can&#10;find means to prevent it.&quot;&#10;&#10;The conversation now grew desultory, and was drawn out, until the&#10;elder sister had extracted from the younger every fact that the feeble&#10;faculties of the latter permitted her to retain, and to communicate.&#10;When Judith was satisfied--though she could never be said" />
    <node id="The second speaker, Rivenoak, views betraying or ambushing an enemy as a valid strategy, even if it means deceiving someone who has offered them hospitality. He justifies it by believing that the ends justify the means, and they are willing to use any method to achieve their goals, regardless of moral or ethical considerations. In contrast to the pale-face brother's view, Rivenoak does not distinguish between open-war strategies and personal betrayal, showing a fundamental difference in values between them." />

Uncas distinguishes between white men and himself by asserting that whites might forget their &quot;Manitou&quot; (a term for spiritual power or god) and their racial identity if they engage in treacherous behavior. This suggests that Uncas believes white men who resort to deceit and treachery are betraying their own cultural and moral values. He thinks that upright pale-faces could not do such things, and those who do deserve to be outcasts and vagabonds.">

Mingo's pale-face brother, who is referred to as a &quot;hunter&quot; in the narrative, believes that betraying or ambushing their Muskrat friend would be wrong. He considers such actions to be against both law and what whites call &quot;gospel.&quot; This suggests that he holds a strong belief in honesty, loyalty, and adherence to moral and ethical principles, which contrasts with the Hurons' willingness to use deception and violence for their purposes.&#10;2. The pale-face brother also distinguishes between open-war strategies and other forms of subterfuge, indicating that he is not entirely against using tactical advantages in warfare but is opposed to personal betrayal and harming friends.&#10;3. In contrast, the Hurons, represented by Rivenoak, view betraying their enemy as a valid strategy, even if it means deceiving someone who has offered them hospitality. This reflects their belief that the ends justify the means, and their willingness to use any method to achieve their goals, regardless of moral or ethical considerations.&#10;4. Furthermore, Rivenoak questions Hawkeye's loyalty to the Muskrat and his daughters, suggesting that he expects everyone to act based on personal interests rather than principles. This highlights a fundamental difference in values between the pale-face brother and the Hurons.&#10;5. Lastly, the pale-face brother demonstrates respect for the Muskrat as an individual, recognizing both his positive and negative qualities, while the Hurons see him merely as a &quot;water snake&quot; – someone who is neither wholly white nor red but rather an outcast unworthy of respect or loyalty.">

He makes no advances to communicate with Deerslayer or the other women, including Hist, and holds himself aloof from them. This distance, combined with his earlier behavior of passing near the group of younger women without any interaction, suggests that he is not particularly invested in what has happened with Hist's escape.&#10;&#10;Moreover, when Hetty encounters the young warrior during her visit to the camp, he shows no apparent concern or interest in the recent development of Hist's escape. Instead, he appears disappointed that it is Hetty who has approached him and not someone else, suggesting that he was expecting someone more interesting to relieve his boredom during the midnight watch. This reaction further highlights the unnamed young Indian's lack of emotional investment in Hist's situation, as he seems more focused on his own personal interests and entertainment.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the narrative, it can be inferred that the unnamed young Indian feels indifferent towards Hist's escape and is mildly disappointed that she has left the camp, rather than showing any signs of worry or care for her well-being.">

He makes no advances to communicate with Deerslayer or the other women, including Hist, and holds himself aloof from them. This distance, combined with his earlier behavior of passing near the group of younger women without any interaction, suggests that he is not particularly invested in what has happened with Hist's escape.&#10;&#10;Moreover, when Hetty encounters the young warrior during her visit to the camp, he shows no apparent concern or interest in the recent development of Hist's escape. Instead, he appears disappointed that it is Hetty who has approached him and not someone else, suggesting that he was expecting someone more interesting to relieve his boredom during the midnight watch. This reaction further highlights the unnamed young Indian's lack of emotional investment in Hist's situation, as he seems more focused on his own personal interests and entertainment.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the narrative, it can be inferred that the unnamed young Indian feels indifferent towards Hist's escape and is mildly disappointed that she has left the camp, rather than showing any signs of worry or care for her well-being.">

She is particularly incensed that Deerslayer only killed the warrior when his spirit was not present, and she believes that his actions have brought shame upon him.

Uncas sees deception and treachery as unacceptable behaviors, especially among friends, and he associates them with white men who betray their own cultural and moral values. According to him, upright pale-faces could not engage in such behavior, and those who do should be outcasts and vagabonds. Uncas holds this view of deception and treachery as unacceptable for any group of people, but he seems particularly critical of white men who resort to it. This is evident when he refuses to participate in Rivenoak's plan to have Hawkeye deceive Hutter, stating that he will do his best not to disgrace the people among whom he got his training and hoping that any fault will be laid on the Delawares or their allies and friends the Mohicans, rather than on him.">

He makes no advances to communicate with Deerslayer or the other women, including Hist, and holds himself aloof from them. This distance, combined with his earlier behavior of passing near the group of younger women without any interaction, suggests that he is not particularly invested in what has happened with Hist's escape.&#10;&#10;Moreover, when Hetty encounters the young warrior during her visit to the camp, he shows no apparent concern or interest in the recent development of Hist's escape. Instead, he appears disappointed that it is Hetty who has approached him and not someone else, suggesting that he was expecting someone more interesting to relieve his boredom during the midnight watch. This reaction further highlights the unnamed young Indian's lack of emotional investment in Hist's situation, as he seems more focused on his own personal interests and entertainment.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the narrative, it can be inferred that the unnamed young Indian feels indifferent towards Hist's escape and is mildly disappointed that she has left the camp, rather than showing any signs of worry or care for her well-being.">

The pale-face brother also distinguishes between open-war strategies and other forms of subterfuge, indicating that he is not entirely against using tactical advantages in warfare but is opposed to personal betrayal and harming friends.&#10;3. In contrast, the Hurons, represented by Rivenoak, view betraying their enemy as a valid strategy, even if it means deceiving someone who has offered them hospitality.

Furthermore, Rivenoak questions Hawkeye's loyalty to the Muskrat and his daughters, suggesting that he expects everyone to act based on personal interests rather than principles. This highlights a fundamental difference in values between the pale-face brother and the Hurons.&#10;5. Lastly, the pale-face brother demonstrates respect for the Muskrat as an individual, recognizing both his positive and negative qualities, while the Hurons see him merely as a &quot;water snake&quot; – someone who is neither wholly white nor red but rather an outcast unworthy of respect or loyalty.">

    <node id="Monks wanted a certain sum in return for making Oliver a thief as part of a larger plan or purpose that he had. The narrative does not provide specific details about this purpose, but it is mentioned that Monks was watching out for Oliver and recognized him as the same child he was looking for.&#10;&#10;The proofs of Oliver's identity being referred to at the bottom of the river are related to the mother of Oliver. Monks revealed that these proofs were given to an old woman by the mother, who has since passed away and whose body is now lying at the bottom of the river. It is suggested that these proofs could help establish Oliver's true identity and potentially reveal more information about his family background." />
    <node id=" day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be&#10;the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn't make out&#10;why.  A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he&#10;should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a&#10;thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.'&#10;&#10;'For what purpose?' asked Rose.&#10;&#10;'He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of&#10;finding out,' said the girl; 'and there are not many people besides me&#10;that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.  But&#10;I did; and I saw him no more till last night.'&#10;&#10;'And what occurred then?'&#10;&#10;'I'll tell you, lady.  Last night he came again.  Again they went&#10;upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray&#10;me, again listened at the door.  The first words I heard Monks say were&#10;these:  &quot;So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of&#10;the river, and the old hag that received them from" />
    <node id=" those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to&#10;tell you what I have overheard.  Do you know a man named Monks?'&#10;&#10;'No,' said Rose.&#10;&#10;'He knows you,' replied the girl; 'and knew you were here, for it was&#10;by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.'&#10;&#10;'I never heard the name,' said Rose.&#10;&#10;'Then he goes by some other amongst us,' rejoined the girl, 'which I&#10;more than thought before.  Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put&#10;into your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this&#10;man--listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.&#10;I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about,&#10;you know--'&#10;&#10;'Yes,' said Rose, 'I understand.'&#10;&#10;'--That Monks,' pursued the girl, 'had seen him accidently with two of&#10;our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be&#10;the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn't make out&#10;why." />
    <node id="&#10;these:  &quot;So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of&#10;the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is&#10;rotting in her coffin.&quot;  They laughed, and talked of his success in&#10;doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,&#10;said that though he had got the young devil's money safely now, he'd&#10;rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been&#10;to have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him&#10;through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital&#10;felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit&#10;of him besides.'&#10;&#10;'What is all this!' said Rose.&#10;&#10;'The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,' replied the girl.&#10;'Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to&#10;yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy's life&#10;without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn't,&#10;he'd be upon the watch to meet him" />
    <node id="&#10;'I almost forgot that.'&#10;&#10;'You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; 'placing this poor girl entirely out&#10;of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these&#10;scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should&#10;we bring about?'&#10;&#10;'Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,' suggested the&#10;doctor, 'and transporting the rest.'&#10;&#10;'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but no doubt they will&#10;bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step&#10;in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very&#10;Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to&#10;Oliver's, which is the same thing.'&#10;&#10;'How?' inquired the doctor.&#10;&#10;'Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in&#10;getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,&#10;Monks, upon his knees.  That can only be done by stratagem, and by&#10;catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.  For, suppose&#10;he were apprehended," />

But, before we can resolve upon any&#10;precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to&#10;ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the&#10;understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;&#10;or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an&#10;account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us&#10;to identify him.  She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is&#10;Tuesday.  I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly&#10;quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.'&#10;&#10;Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving&#10;a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course&#10;occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very&#10;strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried&#10;unanimously.&#10;&#10;'I should" />
    <node id=".'&#10;&#10;'Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?' said Rose.&#10;'This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,&#10;benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?'&#10;&#10;'You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a&#10;secret, and advise you what to do,' rejoined the girl.&#10;&#10;'But where can I find you again when it is necessary?' asked Rose.  'I&#10;do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will&#10;you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?'&#10;&#10;'Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and&#10;come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I&#10;shall not be watched or followed?' asked the girl.&#10;&#10;'I promise you solemnly,' answered Rose.&#10;&#10;'Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,' said&#10;the girl without hesitation, 'I will walk on London Bridge if I am&#10;alive.'&#10;&#10;'Stay another moment,' interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly&#10;towards the door.  'Think once again on your own condition" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Oliver Twist is currently with Rose Maylie, who has left him in a hackney-coach while she goes to speak with Mr. Brownlow at his residence in Craven Street, Strand. She did not bring him along because she wanted to ensure that Mr. Brownlow was prepared to receive him before their arrival." />
    <node id=",' replied the boy.&#10;'Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at last, and you should be&#10;able to know that I have told you the truth!'&#10;&#10;'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said Rose,&#10;soothing him.  'But what is this?--of whom do you speak?'&#10;&#10;'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to&#10;articulate, 'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we&#10;have so often talked about.'&#10;&#10;'Where?' asked Rose.&#10;&#10;'Getting out of a coach,' replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,&#10;'and going into a house.  I didn't speak to him--I couldn't speak to&#10;him, for he didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go&#10;up to him.  But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they&#10;said he did.  Look here,' said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, 'here&#10;it is; here's where he lives--I'm going there directly!  Oh, dear me,&#10;dear me!  What" />
    <node id=", 'here&#10;it is; here's where he lives--I'm going there directly!  Oh, dear me,&#10;dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak&#10;again!'&#10;&#10;With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many&#10;other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was&#10;Craven Street, in the Strand.  She very soon determined upon turning&#10;the discovery to account.&#10;&#10;'Quick!' she said.  'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready&#10;to go with me.  I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss&#10;of time.  I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour,&#10;and be ready as soon as you are.'&#10;&#10;Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five&#10;minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.  When they arrived&#10;there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the&#10;old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,&#10;requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business" />
    <node id=" on your&#10;glasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will&#10;you?'&#10;&#10;The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But&#10;Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to&#10;his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.&#10;&#10;'God be good to me!' cried the old lady, embracing him; 'it is my&#10;innocent boy!'&#10;&#10;'My dear old nurse!' cried Oliver.&#10;&#10;'He would come back--I knew he would,' said the old lady, holding him&#10;in her arms.  'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's son he is&#10;dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?  Ah! the&#10;same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.  I&#10;have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every&#10;day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone&#10;since I was a lightsome young creature.'  Running on thus, and now&#10;holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to" />
    <node id="man to the one who had spoken.&#10;&#10;'That is my name,' said the old gentleman.  'This is my friend, Mr.&#10;Grimwig.  Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?'&#10;&#10;'I believe,' interposed Miss Maylie, 'that at this period of our&#10;interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.&#10;If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I&#10;wish to speak to you.'&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow inclined his head.  Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very&#10;stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and&#10;dropped into it again.&#10;&#10;'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,' said Rose, naturally&#10;embarrassed; 'but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a&#10;very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest&#10;in hearing of him again.'&#10;&#10;'Indeed!' said Mr. Brownlow.&#10;&#10;'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied Rose.&#10;&#10;The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig" />
    <node id="1. It is decided that they will wait until Sunday night to see the girl (Nancy) who can identify Monks, as this is the earliest available time.&#10;2. They agree to remain quiet and keep the matter a secret until then, even from Oliver himself.&#10;3. Mr. Losberne, who is with them for the next two days, cannot be trusted with the secret due to his impetuous nature. Rose also fears that Mrs. Maylie would immediately consult the doctor if informed, leading to hasty actions against Monks before they have enough information.&#10;4. Mr. Brownlow will hold a solemn conference with Mr. Losberne to discuss the situation.&#10;5. They plan to cautiously inform Mrs. Maylie of the developments in the meantime.&#10;6. These arrangements are made to ensure Oliver's safety and to gather more information about Monks' plan before taking any action against him." />
    <node id=", mingled with her love for&#10;her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour,&#10;was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.&#10;&#10;They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing&#10;for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.  It was now midnight of&#10;the first day.  What course of action could she determine upon, which&#10;could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone&#10;the journey without exciting suspicion?&#10;&#10;Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but&#10;Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's&#10;impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first&#10;explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of&#10;Oliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her&#10;representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no&#10;experienced person.  These were all reasons for the greatest caution&#10;and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie,&#10;whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the&#10;worthy doctor on the subject" />
    <node id=" I was a lightsome young creature.'  Running on thus, and now&#10;holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to&#10;her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul&#10;laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.&#10;&#10;Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led&#10;the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration&#10;of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise&#10;and perplexity.  Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in&#10;her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.  The old gentleman&#10;considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold&#10;solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.  To afford him an&#10;early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged&#10;that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and&#10;that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all&#10;that had occurred.  These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver&#10;returned home.&#10;&#10;Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath.&#10;Nancy" />
    <node id=" this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite&#10;hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and&#10;disappointments already quite numerous enough.  Come!  Supper has been&#10;announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will&#10;have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company,&#10;and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the&#10;world.'&#10;&#10;With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and&#10;escorted her into the supper-room.  Mr. Losberne followed, leading&#10;Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The elderly gentleman who hurried out of the room, kissed Rose without any warning, and then returned with Oliver is Mr. Brownlow. He is not directly related to Rose Maylie by blood but becomes closely associated with her family in the course of the novel. Earlier in the story, it was Mr. Brownlow who showed kindness to Oliver Twist when he lived in London, unaware that they were connected by a shared history involving the true identity of Oliver's parents and the villainous Monks. The kiss Rose receives from Mr. Grimwig is an expression of his delight upon learning about Oliver's connection to Mr. Brownlow, as it validates Rose's trust in the truthfulness of the girl who provided the information." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;'He is waiting in a coach at the door,' replied Rose.&#10;&#10;'At this door!' cried the old gentleman.  With which he hurried out of&#10;the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,&#10;without another word.&#10;&#10;When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,&#10;and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,&#10;described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and&#10;the table; sitting in it all the time.  After performing this&#10;evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room&#10;at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed&#10;her without the slightest preface.&#10;&#10;'Hush!' he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual&#10;proceeding.  'Don't be afraid.  I'm old enough to be your grandfather.&#10;You're a sweet girl.  I like you.  Here they are!'&#10;&#10;In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former&#10;seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig" />
    <node id="1. Rose, Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Grimwig decided to wait until Sunday night to meet the girl (Nancy) who can identify Monks.&#10;2.

These arrangements were made to ensure Oliver's safety and to gather more information about Monks' plan before taking any action against him.&#10;7. To inform Mrs. Maylie, Rose related all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow's house, while she reserved Nancy's information for Mr. Brownlow's private ear." />
    <node id=".  Will you let me know what&#10;intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me to promise that&#10;I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since&#10;I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had&#10;imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob&#10;me, has been considerably shaken.'&#10;&#10;Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a&#10;few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.&#10;Brownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's&#10;private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,&#10;for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former&#10;benefactor and friend.&#10;&#10;'Thank God!' said the old gentleman.  'This is great happiness to me,&#10;great happiness.  But you have not told me where he is now, Miss&#10;Maylie.  You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have&#10;brought him?'&#10;&#10;'He is waiting in a coach at the door,' replied Rose.&#10;&#10;'At this door!' cried the old gentleman.

    <node id="Nancy, a female character in the story, has been ill and weak due to watching and privation. When she meets Sikes, who is also unwell and lying in bed, he comments on her pale appearance but does not show much concern. Instead, he roughly shakes her when she exhibits unusual behavior, showing his lack of empathy and patience. After Sikes drinks a sleeping draught and falls into a trance-like state, Nancy hurries away from the house, appearing anxious and agitated, but Sikes does not seem to notice or suspect anything. Overall, Sikes's reaction upon meeting Nancy is indifferent, and he treats her roughly when she tries to help him, highlighting their strained relationship." />
    <node id=", was a female:  so pale&#10;and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been&#10;considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has&#10;already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to&#10;Mr. Sikes's question.&#10;&#10;'Not long gone seven,' said the girl.  'How do you feel to-night, Bill?'&#10;&#10;'As weak as water,' replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes&#10;and limbs.  'Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering&#10;bed anyhow.'&#10;&#10;Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised&#10;him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her&#10;awkwardness, and struck her.&#10;&#10;'Whining are you?' said Sikes.  'Come!  Don't stand snivelling there.&#10;If you can't do anything better than that, cut off altogether.  D'ye&#10;hear me?'&#10;&#10;'I hear you,' replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a&#10;laugh.  'What fancy have you got" />
    <node id=" a fire&#10;in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water&#10;with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass&#10;towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when&#10;these symptoms first struck him.&#10;&#10;'Why, burn my body!' said the man, raising himself on his hands as he&#10;stared the girl in the face.  'You look like a corpse come to life&#10;again.  What's the matter?'&#10;&#10;'Matter!' replied the girl.  'Nothing.  What do you look at me so hard&#10;for?'&#10;&#10;'What foolery is this?' demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and&#10;shaking her roughly.  'What is it?  What do you mean?  What are you&#10;thinking of?'&#10;&#10;'Of many things, Bill,' replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so,&#10;pressing her hands upon her eyes.  'But, Lord!  What odds in that?'&#10;&#10;The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed&#10;" />

'I may be too late, even now.'&#10;&#10;She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully&#10;round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she&#10;expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon&#10;her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the&#10;robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with&#10;noiseless touch, hurried from the house.&#10;&#10;A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which&#10;she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.&#10;&#10;'Has it long gone the half-hour?' asked the girl.&#10;&#10;'It'll strike the hour in another quarter,' said the man: raising his&#10;lantern to her face.&#10;&#10;'And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,' muttered Nancy:&#10;brushing swiftly past him" />

    <node id=" just now, if you'd thought of that, would you?  Come, come; say&#10;you wouldn't.'&#10;&#10;'Well, then,' rejoined Mr. Sikes, 'I wouldn't.  Why, damme, now, the&#10;girls's whining again!'&#10;&#10;'It's nothing,' said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. 'Don't&#10;you seem to mind me.  It'll soon be over.'&#10;&#10;'What'll be over?' demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. 'What foolery&#10;are you up to, now, again?  Get up and bustle about, and don't come&#10;over me with your woman's nonsense.'&#10;&#10;At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was&#10;delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really&#10;weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and&#10;fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths&#10;with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his&#10;threats.  Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon&#10;emergency; for Miss Nancy" />
    <node id=" protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would&#10;only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly&#10;remarking that if he couldn't get any more he must accompany him home;&#10;with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.  The&#10;Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,&#10;attended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself&#10;on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the&#10;young lady's return.&#10;&#10;In due course, they arrived at Fagin's abode, where they found Toby&#10;Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,&#10;which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and&#10;with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his&#10;young friends.  Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found&#10;relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and&#10;mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat&#10;to go.&#10;&#10;'" />
    <node id="1. Based on the description provided, it can be inferred that Mr. Sikes is currently experiencing extreme poverty, as indicated by the scarcity of furniture and total absence of comfort in his new lodgings. The disappearance of all small moveables such as spare clothes and linen also supports this conclusion. Furthermore, Mr. Sikes's appearance has deteriorated due to illness, with a soiled nightcap, stiff black beard, and a set of features made more cadaverous by his sickness.&#10;&#10;2. The female occupying herself by patching an old waistcoat at the window is Nancy, a character who has already figured in the tale.

The dog sat at&#10;the bedside:  now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now&#10;pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the&#10;street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.&#10;Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which&#10;formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale&#10;and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been&#10;considerable difficulty in recognising her as the" />
    <node id="&#10;On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned&#10;in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as&#10;therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily&#10;growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.&#10;&#10;The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of&#10;those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it&#10;was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great&#10;distance from his former lodgings.  It was not, in appearance, so&#10;desirable a habitation as his old quarters:  being a mean and&#10;badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one&#10;small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty&#10;lane.  Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's&#10;having gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of&#10;furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the&#10;disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,&#10;bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the me" />

He also mentions that he couldn't help it and couldn't go into a long explanation before company, implying that his absence might have been due to some unavoidable circumstance or obligation.&#10;2. Fagin emphasizes that he has never forgotten Sikes and never once left him in need, despite the fact that Sikes feels neglected. This statement could be interpreted as Fagin's attempt to maintain a close relationship with Sikes and reassure him of his loyalty.&#10;3. However, Sikes expresses disgust at Fagin's claim by growling 'upon your what?' which can be seen as skepticism towards Fagin's honesty. This further highlights the strained relationship between the two characters.&#10;&#10;In summary, Fagin tries to justify his absence and reassure Sikes of his loyalty, but Sikes remains skeptical and frustrated by Fagin's negligence during his time of need." />

'And us&#10;come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.'&#10;&#10;'The things is well enough in their way,' observed Mr. Sikes:  a little&#10;soothed as he glanced over the table; 'but what have you got to say for&#10;yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,&#10;blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this&#10;mortal time, than if I was that 'ere dog.--Drive him down, Charley!'&#10;&#10;'I never see such a jolly dog as that,' cried Master Bates, doing as he&#10;was desired.

'The Artful's a&#10;deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get&#10;dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you&#10;put him up to it.  Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all&#10;sure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she's gone.'&#10;&#10;After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the&#10;amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four&#10;and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would&#10;only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly&#10;" />

    <node id="The old gentleman, Mr. Brownlow, decides to end the conversation and lead everyone to supper in order to prevent further discussion on the matter at hand, which is the request Rose Maylie has come to make regarding Oliver Twist. He does this for a few reasons: firstly, he wants to avoid increasing hopes that might be disappointed later if nothing can be done; secondly, he wishes to shield his friend Mr. Grimwig from any involvement in the matter, as he believes Mr. Grimwig is unaware of the details and would not take kindly to being brought into it; and thirdly, he wants to ensure that Oliver, who is waiting alone in the next room, does not feel neglected or abandoned.

The narrative does not provide specific details about this purpose, but it is mentioned that Monks was watching out for Oliver and recognized him as the same child he was looking for.&#10;2. The proofs of Oliver's identity being referred to at the bottom of the river are related to the mother of Oliver. Monks revealed that these proofs were given to an old woman by the mother, who has since passed away and whose body is now lying at the bottom of the river. It is suggested that these proofs could help establish Oliver's true identity and potentially reveal more information about his family background." />

She believes that Mr. Brownlow, given their past connection, would be interested in hearing about Oliver again.&#10;&#10;The young friend Rose Maylie refers to is Oliver Twist, who had lived in London and was taken in by Mr. Brownlow unaware of their shared history involving the true identity of Oliver's parents and the villainous Monks." />

Firstly, it would ensure that those who have caused harm and distress to Oliver are held accountable for their actions. This could bring a sense of closure and relief to Oliver, as well as anyone else who has been affected by their criminal activities. Secondly, it could potentially lead to the recovery of the proofs related to Oliver's identity, which are currently at the bottom of the river. These proofs could help establish Oliver's true identity and reveal more information about his family background." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Monks revealed that he had a role in Oliver's past and was seeking to acquire certain proofs of Oliver's identity which were at the bottom of a river. This information suggests that Monks has malicious intentions towards Oliver, possibly aiming to conceal or manipulate his true identity.&#10;&#10;Upon hearing the truth from the girl (Nancy), Rose would have responded with concern and determination to uncover more about Monks' plan and ensure Oliver's safety. The arrangements made by Rose, Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Grimwig to wait until Sunday night to meet Nancy and gather more information demonstrate their cautious approach in addressing this matter. They also indicate Rose's commitment to protecting Oliver and revealing the whole truth about his past, including Monks' role in it." />
    <node id="When Rose Maylie reveals that Oliver Twist is the young friend she is referring to, both Mr. Brownlow and Mr. Grimwig are taken aback. However, their reactions are not explicitly described in detail. The narrative only mentions that &quot;The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig started out of his seat with a suddenness that nearly overturned his chair.&quot; This suggests that Mr. Grimwig was surprised by the revelation, but it does not give a clear indication of Mr. Brownlow's reaction.&#10;&#10;In the given text, there is no explicit statement about Mr. Brownlow's reaction to the news of Oliver Twist's true identity. The next sentence after Rose mentions Oliver's name focuses on Mr. Grimwig's surprise rather than Mr. Brownlow's response. Therefore, while it is reasonable to assume that Mr. Brownlow also reacted to the news, the exact nature of his reaction remains unknown based on the provided narrative excerpt." />
    <node id="Mr. William Sikes has recently experienced a significant decline in his financial status, as indicated by his change in living arrangements. The new place he is staying at is a mean and badly-furnished apartment, much smaller than his previous lodgings. It is also located in a less desirable part of town and abuts a dirty lane. The room has very limited lighting, with only one small window in the shelving roof.&#10;&#10;Moreover, there are clear signs of extreme poverty in this new living space. There is a scarcity of furniture, and there is an absence of comfort. Additionally, all small moveables such as spare clothes and linen have disappeared, suggesting that Sikes has sold or pawned them off to make ends meet. These indicators suggest that Mr. William Sikes has recently undergone a significant decline in his financial status, leading him to take up residence in much more meager and impoverished conditions than before." />
    <node id="1. Rose Maylie is taking Oliver Twist to Mr. Brownlow's residence in Craven Street, Strand.&#10;2. The purpose of her visit is to discuss Oliver's circumstances with Mr. Brownlow. She believes that, given their past connection, Mr. Brownlow would be interested in hearing about Oliver again. This is confirmed later when she relates 'all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow's house' and Mr. Brownlow expresses his happiness at this news." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Nancy is in a weak and pale condition due to watching and privation. When she sees Sikes, who is also unwell and lying in bed, he roughly shakes her when she exhibits unusual behavior, showing his lack of empathy and patience. Despite Sikes's own illness, he strikes Nancy and accuses her of whining when she appears emotional. This reaction from Sikes highlights the strained relationship between them, with Sikes being skeptical and frustrated by Fagin's negligence during his time of need.&#10;&#10;Nancy, on the other hand, tries to hide her true emotions and responds to Sikes with a tone of forced gaiety. The narrative also suggests that Sikes has become increasingly wary due to Nancy's unusual behavior and suspects that she might be planning something. Overall, both Nancy and Sikes are in poor physical health, and their conversation reveals their strained relationship marked by Sikes's frustration, skepticism, and rough treatment towards Nancy." />

This suggests that Toby Crackit saw himself as superior to the other boy and considered the money he won as insignificant.&#10;2. Toby Crackit then swaggered out of the room with great elegance and gentility, leading Chitling to admire his legs and boots till they were out of sight. When Tom, another boy, expressed his admiration for Toby Crackit's acquaintance, Fagin agreed and implied that Toby Crackit was a 'heavy swell' who wouldn't give his acquaintance to others easily.

    <node id="Nancy, a character from the impoverished area of Spitalfields, is hurrying through the West-End of London on her way to a family hotel near Hyde Park. She is rushing because she has made an arrangement with Rose Maylie to discuss a mystery and needs to be there at a specific time. The people she passes by are surprised by her speed and quick movements, especially since it is not common for someone from her background to move through this wealthier area in such a manner. This creates curiosity among the onlookers as they try to understand why she is in a rush and where she is heading." />

The clock struck ten, increasing her&#10;impatience.  She tore along the narrow pavement:  elbowing the&#10;passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses'&#10;heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly&#10;watching their opportunity to do the like.&#10;&#10;'The woman is mad!' said the people, turning to look after her as she&#10;rushed away.&#10;&#10;When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were&#10;comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still&#10;greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past.

She had loitered for a few&#10;paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the&#10;sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall.  The porter's seat&#10;was vacant.  She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced&#10;towards the stairs.&#10;&#10;'Now, young woman!' said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a&#10;door behind her, 'who do you want here?'&#10;&#10;'A lady who is stopping in this house,' answered the girl.&#10;&#10;'A lady!' was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. 'What lady?'&#10;&#10;'Miss Maylie,' said Nancy.&#10;&#10;The" />
    <node id="In the narrative excerpt, Nancy instructs the man to deliver the following message to Rose Maylie: A young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone. If the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor. The urgency comes from Nancy's request for the message to be delivered for God Almighty's sake, and she insists on waiting for Rose Maylie's answer before leaving." />
    <node id="?'&#10;&#10;This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who&#10;with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward&#10;to interfere.&#10;&#10;'Take it up for her, Joe; can't you?' said this person.&#10;&#10;'What's the good?' replied the man.  'You don't suppose the young lady&#10;will see such as her; do you?'&#10;&#10;This allusion to Nancy's doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of&#10;chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great&#10;fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly&#10;advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.&#10;&#10;'Do what you like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again;&#10;'but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for&#10;God Almighty's sake.'&#10;&#10;The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that&#10;the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.&#10;&#10;'What's it to be?' said the man, with one foot on the stairs.&#10;&#10;'That a" />

Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,&#10;listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn,&#10;of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they&#10;became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman&#10;was to walk upstairs.&#10;&#10;'It's no good being proper in this world,' said the first housemaid.&#10;&#10;'Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,' said the&#10;second.&#10;&#10;The third contented herself with wondering 'what ladies" />

The lack of personal belongings such as spare clothes and linen in Mr. Sikes's new lodgings suggests that he is currently experiencing extreme poverty and has likely sold or pawned off these items to make ends meet. The meager and impoverished conditions of his living space also support this conclusion.&#10;2. The female seated by the window, who is unrecognizable due to her pale and reduced state, is Nancy. She has been ill and weak due to watching and privation, which has made it difficult to recognize her without hearing her voice. Despite Sikes's own illness, he roughly shakes Nancy when she exhibits unusual behavior and later strikes her, showing his lack of empathy and patience towards her." />
    <node id="According to Mr. Fagin's instructions, the Artful Dodger (Dodger) brought a rabbit pie, half a pound of seven and six-penny green, and a pound and a half of moist sugar for their dinner. These items were highly praised by Charley Bates for their rarity and excellence." />

Dodger! Charley!&#10;It's time you were on the lay.  Come!  It's near ten, and nothing done&#10;yet.'&#10;&#10;In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their&#10;hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,&#10;as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in&#10;whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very&#10;conspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as there are a great number of&#10;spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.&#10;Chitling for" />

'Don't&#10;stand chattering and grinning at me!'&#10;&#10;With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's&#10;assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who&#10;had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on&#10;the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from&#10;the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked&#10;it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents&#10;down the patient's throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to&#10;prevent mistakes" />
    <node id="1. After learning about Nancy's history from Rose, Dr. Graham initially planned to take immediate action by threatening her with legal consequences and even seeking the assistance of the authorities, namely Messrs. Blathers and Duff. His reaction was driven by anger and a desire for retribution.&#10;2. Dr. Graham was restrained from carrying out his intentions due to a combination of factors. Firstly, Mr. Brownlow's intervention, both through physical restraint and persuasive arguments, helped calm Dr. Graham down. Secondly, Mr. Brownlow's own irascible temperament played a role in dissuading Dr. Graham from acting hastily. Thirdly, the realization that hasty actions could lead to unforeseen consequences also contributed to Dr. Graham reconsidering his initial plan.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dr. Graham's impetuous nature was initially inclined towards taking desperate measures against Nancy. However, the combined efforts of Mr. Brownlow's restraint and persuasion, as well as Dr. Graham's own self-reflection on the potential consequences, ultimately prevented him from carrying out his intentions." />
    <node id="Rose Maylie's trial and difficulty lie in her struggle to balance her desire to uncover the mystery surrounding Oliver Twist's history and her commitment to protect the confidentiality of the information shared by the mysterious girl she met. On one hand, Rose is eager to discuss Oliver's circumstances with Mr. Brownlow, as she believes he would be interested in hearing about Oliver again due to their past connection. However, she also promised the wretched woman she met that she would keep her secret and not follow or watch her. The girl explicitly instructed Rose to come alone or with only one other person who knows the secret, creating a dilemma for Rose as she seeks to maintain her trustworthiness while also pursuing the truth about Oliver's history. This inner conflict tests Rose's loyalty, integrity, and discretion." />
    <node id="The condition of the girl named Nance, also referred to as Nancy, is described as being pale. When the Jew asked her about it, she explained that she had been sitting in a closed space for an extended period and didn't know how long. However, her pallor could potentially be related to stress or anxiety, given the clandestine activities she is involved in, rather than simply being due to the time spent in a confined space." />
    <node id=" drawing her gown loosely&#10;over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door,&#10;listening with breathless interest.  The moment the noise ceased, she&#10;glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and&#10;silence; and was lost in the gloom above.&#10;&#10;The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl&#10;glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards,&#10;the two men were heard descending.  Monks went at once into the street;&#10;and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.  When he returned,&#10;the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.&#10;&#10;'Why, Nance!' exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the&#10;candle, 'how pale you are!'&#10;&#10;'Pale!' echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look&#10;steadily at him.&#10;&#10;'Quite horrible.  What have you been doing to yourself?'&#10;&#10;'Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don't&#10;know how long and all,' replied the girl carelessly." />
    <node id=" Listen!'&#10;&#10;The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared&#10;in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person,&#10;whoever he was, came or went:  until the murmur of a man's voice&#10;reached her ears.  The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her&#10;bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under&#10;the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered&#10;a complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very&#10;remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,&#10;however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at&#10;the time.&#10;&#10;'Bah!' he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; 'it's the&#10;man I expected before; he's coming downstairs.  Not a word about the&#10;money while he's here, Nance.  He won't stop long.  Not ten minutes, my&#10;dear.'&#10;&#10;Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to&#10;the door, as a man's" />

'I have been prompt&#10;enough this time.  Let me have a word with you.'&#10;&#10;The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,&#10;although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.  The Jew:&#10;perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he&#10;endeavoured to get rid of her:  pointed upward, and took Monks out of&#10;the room.&#10;&#10;'Not that infernal hole we were in before,' she could hear the man say&#10;as they went upstairs.  Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did&#10;not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his&#10;companion to the second story.&#10;&#10;Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the&#10;house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely&#10;over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door,&#10;listening with breathless interest.

However, she also promised the wretched woman she met that she would keep her secret and not follow or watch her. The girl explicitly instructed Rose to come alone or with only one other person who knows the secret, creating a dilemma for Rose as she seeks to maintain her trustworthiness while also pursuing the truth about Oliver's history. This inner conflict tests Rose's loyalty, integrity, and discretion.">

This suggests that Toby Crackit saw himself as superior to the other boy and considered the money he won as insignificant.&#10;2. Toby Crackit then swaggered out of the room with great elegance and gentility, leading Chitling to admire his legs and boots till they were out of sight. When Tom, another boy, expressed his admiration for Toby Crackit's acquaintance, Fagin agreed and implied that Toby Crackit was a 'heavy swell' who wouldn't give his acquaintance to others easily. Overall, Toby Crackit treated the money he won with disdain and saw himself as superior to the other boys in Fagin's den.">

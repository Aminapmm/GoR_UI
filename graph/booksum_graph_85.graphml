Turnus' indecision and hesitation in continuing to fight lead to his gradual retreat toward the safety of his camp, as he is overwhelmed by the advancing Trojans who pursue him and press upon him from every side.&#10;2. This situation demonstrates the negative consequences of impulsive behavior during wartime, as Turnus' rash decision to enter the citadel leads to the death of the Trojan Antiphates and increases the danger for the Trojans.&#10;3. The passage does not explicitly state the final outcome of the battle, but it implies that Turnus is eventually overwhelmed and cornered by his enemies due to his indecision and inability to resist their advances." />

He feels that his upbringing and skills qualify him to be a fitting companion for Euryalus in their pursuit of glory." />

    <node id="1. The girdle-belt and caparison that Euryalus finds and wants to keep represent his fascination with &quot;gaudy spoils&quot; and the desire for material wealth. This interest in riches is contrasted with his primary mission of escaping the battlefield with Nisus.&#10;&#10;2. When Euryalus puts on Messapus' helmet, it draws attention to him and ultimately leads to their discovery by Volscens and his men. The shining helm reflects the moonlight, making it difficult for Euryalus and Nisus to remain hidden from their pursuers.&#10;&#10;3. Therefore, the decision to keep these items highlights Euryalus's lack of focus on their main objective and inadvertently leads them into danger, showcasing irony in the narrative." />

Their relationship is characterized by a strong bond of affection and commitment. The speaker, Nisus, along with his friend Euryalus, have sworn an exclusive oath to ensure Ascanius' safety and well-being, promising to do everything in their power to protect him and secure his future happiness.&#10;3. This is evident when Nisus says, &quot;I adjure you both (on you my fortune stands; that and my faith I plight into your hands)&quot; and later when Euryalus responds with a similar commitment, saying, &quot;All this, alone, and leaving me behind! What shall I do? whither go?&quot;&#10;4. The depth of their affection for Ascanius is also reflected in the language they use to describe him, referring to him as &quot;the greatest gift&quot; and pledging their loyalty to him above all else." />
    <node id="1. According to the narrative, when the Trojans see the approaching cloud of dust and the Latian host (Rutulians) advancing towards their walls, they react by shutting their gates, ascending to the bulwarks with shouts, and preparing for battle.&#10;2. Their general's strategy is to wait within their defenses for a chance to fight, and the Trojans follow this order out of obedience and caution, even though they are eager to defend their city and attack their enemies.&#10;3. The narrative does not provide specific details about the Trojans regrouping or changing strategies after the fire incident that killed many of them. However, it can be inferred that they are preparing for a possible attack by readying themselves on the bulwarks and following their general's orders to stay within their lines." />
    <node id="The young man addressed in this passage is Ascanius (also known as Iulus or Julius), who is the son of Aeneas and thus the nephew of the speaker, Nisus.

He implores Nisus to ensure the safe return of his friend Euryalus, promising that the gods, his own conscious worth, and Ascanius himself will reward Nisus for his actions.&#10;&#10;This promise of loyalty is a testament to the strong bond of affection and commitment between Ascanius, Nisus, and Euryalus. The language used to describe their relationship highlights its importance, as they refer to each other as &quot;the greatest gift&quot; and prioritize each other's safety and well-being above all else.

Ascanius responds to his father's words by being moved by his display of filial piety and reaffirming his own commitment to honor and protect his mother in the same way.&#10;&#10;Explanation:&#10;The narrative mentions that Aeneas asks his friends to comfort and support his mother as he must depart for an unknown danger, but it does not provide a direct quote of Aeneas' words. However, based on the context, this request is implied. Ascanius' response is also not explicitly stated in the given text, but it can be inferred that he reaffirms his commitment to honor and protect his mother, as this theme of loyalty and protection among family members is consistent throughout the narrative." />
    <node id="According to Turnus, the Tiber river's behavior signifies that the god of the river is supporting the Latians in their battle against the Trojans. The river raising its head and calling back its waters to its oozy bed is interpreted by Turnus as a sign from Jove that the sea has been secured for the Latins, and the Trojans are now cornered on a small spot of land surrounded by myriads of Latian soldiers. Turnus sees this as an opportunity to destroy the Trojans and interprets it as his fate to do so with sword and fire. Therefore, he uses this supposed divine sign as a rallying cry for his troops to fight against the Trojans." />

However, it is mentioned that Aeneas asks his friends to comfort and support his mother, which could be considered a form of emotional support.&#10;2. The narrative also does not mention any consequence that Aeneas swore regarding the failure of this attempt. It primarily focuses on Aeneas' departure from the battlefield, his request for his friends to care for his mother, and Ascanius' response to this request." />
    <node id="1. After killing Besus and Rhoetus, Nisus and Euryalus decide to take a shortcut through a narrow passage between two enemy camps to reach Aeneas and ensure their own safety. This decision is significant because it demonstrates their determination to complete the mission and fulfill their oath to protect Ascanius, despite the increased danger involved in taking this path.&#10;&#10;2. Nisus suggests this route, as he had previously noticed it during a hunting trip with Euryalus. They are confident in their knowledge of the winding course and every ford along the way, which provides them some advantage in navigating the treacherous path. The significance of this action lies in its riskiness; while it may expedite their journey to Aeneas, it also increases their chances of being discovered by enemy forces.&#10;&#10;3. By choosing this route, Nisus and Euryalus display their commitment to their mission and their loyalty to Ascanius. However, this decision also highlights the irony of their situation: in seeking to protect Ascanius and secure his future happiness, they put themselves in great peril, increasing the likelihood that they may not return to fulfill their promise.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Nisus and Euryalus' decision to take the narrow passage between enemy camps showcases their determination, loyalty, and commitment to their mission and Ascanius' safety. However, this choice also increases the danger they face, creating an ironic situation that underscores the challenges and risks involved in their pursuit of glory and protection for their beloved companion." />

Turnus is ranging eagerly over the plain in response to the Tiber river's behavior, which he interprets as a sign from Jove that the sea has been secured for the Latins and the Trojans are now cornered on a small spot of land surrounded by myriads of Latian soldiers. Seeing this as an opportunity to destroy the Trojans and his fate to do so with sword and fire, Turnus uses this supposed divine sign as a rallying cry for his troops to fight against the Trojans.&#10;2. When Turnus spies the location of the navy of his enemies, he decides to challenge the Trojan warrior to single combat, which results in him killing a Trojan named Antiphates who was the first person Turnus met when he entered the citadel. This puts the Trojans in a dangerous situation as Turnus is now inside their walls and prepared for battle." />

    <node id="1. The &quot;giant&quot; referred to in the text is Turnus himself. However, there seems to be some confusion as the provided supporting materials do not mention a giant killing Trojans with a mighty blow causing them to flee in terror and use their weapons against each other.&#10;2. Based on the narrative, Turnus did kill Antiphates, who was Sarpedon's son, but this confrontation occurred after Turnus heard the news of the Trojan success in battle. This event led to a dangerous situation for the Trojans as Turnus was now inside their walls and prepared for battle.&#10;3. Therefore, based on the narrative, Turnus did not kill Trojans with a mighty blow causing them to flee in terror and use their weapons against each other." />
    <node id="1. The girdle-belt and caparison that Euryalus finds and wants to keep represent his fascination with &quot;gaudy spoils&quot; and the desire for material wealth. This interest in riches is contrasted with his primary mission of escaping the battlefield with Nisus.&#10;&#10;Answer: In the narrative, Euryalus discovers valuable items like a girdle-belt and caparison during their escape attempt. His fascination with these &quot;gaudy spoils&quot; highlights his desire for material wealth, which contrasts with their primary mission of escaping the battlefield safely. Keeping these items showcases Euryalus' lack of focus on their main objective and inadvertently leads them into danger, demonstrating irony in the narrative.&#10;&#10;Reference(s):&#10;warmth, or make we gods of our desire?&#10;  A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,&#10;  Eager of action, enemy to rest:&#10;  This urges me to fight, and fires my mind&#10;  To leave a memorable name behind.&#10;  Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine&#10;  Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine&#10;  Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:&#10;  The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;&#10;  All hush'd around.

The shining helm reflects the moonlight, making it difficult for Euryalus and Nisus to remain hidden from their pursuers.&#10;&#10;Answer: Euryalus donning Messapus' helmet is a significant moment in the narrative. This action draws attention to him and ultimately leads to their discovery by Volscens and his men. The shining helm reflects the moonlight, making it difficult for Euryalus and Nisus to remain hidden from their pursuers.&#10;&#10;Reference(s):&#10;The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;&#10;  All hush'd around.

Therefore, the decision to keep these items highlights Euryalus's lack of focus on their main objective and inadvertently leads them into danger, showcasing irony in the narrative.&#10;&#10;Answer: The decision to keep the gaudy spoils highlights Euryalus's lack of focus on their main objective, which is to safely escape the battlefield. This choice ultimately leads them into danger, demonstrating irony in the narrative.&#10;&#10;Reference(s):&#10;  A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.&#10;  Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;&#10;  By message both would hasten his return:&#10;  If they confer what I demand on thee,&#10;  (For fame is recompense enough for me,)&#10;  Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied&#10;  A way that safely will my passage guide.&quot;&#10;&#10;Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,&#10;  With love of praise and noble envy struck;&#10;  Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:&#10;  &quot;All this, alone, and leaving me behind!" />
    <node id="The Trojans were driven to hide behind their walls and resist fighting back against Numanus because they had previously been defeated in battle twice and did not want to engage in another open confrontation. Numanus' insults and boasting about his realm and royal bride further provoked the Trojans, but they remained cautious and kept their walls up as a shield. This demonstrates their defensive strategy and desire to protect themselves from further harm." />
    <node id="1. The rewards that the country gods can bestow upon Nisus and Euryalus include delivering them from danger and ensuring the survival of the Trojan race. This is alluded to in the passage when the speaker says, &quot;Our country gods, in whom our trust we place, / Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race.&quot; The specific rewards are not mentioned, but they are likely related to the well-being and success of the Trojans as a whole.&#10;2. Ascanius can ensure his father's safety upon his return by continuing to honor and protect him, just as he has pledged to do for his mother. There is no mention in the passage of any specific consequences or actions that Ascanius swore regarding his father's safe return, but it is implied that his loyalty and commitment will play a role in ensuring Aeneas' well-being.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that while the narrative does not explicitly state the rewards or consequences mentioned in the question, the passage implies that the characters believe in the power of divine intervention and personal loyalty to protect and ensure each other's safety." />

Nisus suggests this route, as he had previously noticed it during a hunting trip with Euryalus.

After killing Besus and Rhoetus, Nisus and Euryalus decide to take a shortcut through a narrow passage between two enemy camps to reach Aeneas and ensure their own safety. This decision is significant because it demonstrates their determination to complete the mission and fulfill their oath to protect Ascanius, despite the increased danger involved in taking this path.&#10;&#10;2. Nisus suggests this route, as he had previously noticed it during a hunting trip with Euryalus. They are confident in their knowledge of the winding course and every ford along the way, which provides them some advantage in navigating the treacherous path. The significance of this action lies in its riskiness; while it may expedite their journey to Aeneas, it also increases their chances of being discovered by enemy forces.&#10;&#10;3. By choosing this route, Nisus and Euryalus display their commitment to their mission and their loyalty to Ascanius. However, this decision also highlights the irony of their situation: in seeking to protect Ascanius and secure his future happiness, they put themselves in great peril, increasing the likelihood that they may not return to fulfill their promise.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Nisus and Euryalus' decision to take the narrow passage between enemy camps showcases their determination, loyalty, and commitment to their mission and Ascanius' safety.

    <node id="Rawdon Crawley felt profound gratitude towards his sister Jane because she had secured his release from the bailiff's house where he was detained due to financial difficulties. After his release, Jane mentioned that Pitt, her husband, was away at a dinner meeting when Rawdon's note arrived, and she had come herself to help him. Touched by her kindness, Rawdon expressed his feelings of change and a desire to improve himself, stating, &quot;I want--I want--to be--&quot; but not completing the sentence. From their conversation, it can be implied that Rawdon wished to make some positive changes in his life as a result of his sister's influence and the newfound affection for his nephew, little Rawdy." />
    <node id=" Mr. Moss were quickly settled, perhaps to the&#10;disappointment of that gentleman, who had counted on having the Colonel&#10;as his guest over Sunday at least; and Jane, with beaming smiles and&#10;happiness in her eyes, carried away Rawdon from the bailiff's house,&#10;and they went homewards in the cab in which she had hastened to his&#10;release.  &quot;Pitt was gone to a parliamentary dinner,&quot; she said, &quot;when&#10;Rawdon's note came, and so, dear Rawdon, I--I came myself&quot;; and she put&#10;her kind hand in his.  Perhaps it was well for Rawdon Crawley that Pitt&#10;was away at that dinner.  Rawdon thanked his sister a hundred times,&#10;and with an ardour of gratitude which touched and almost alarmed that&#10;soft-hearted woman. &quot;Oh,&quot; said he, in his rude, artless way, &quot;you--you&#10;don't know how I'm changed since I've known you, and--and little Rawdy.&#10;I--I'd like to change somehow.  You see I want--I want--to be--&quot; He did&#10;not finish the sentence, but she could interpret it.  And that night&#10;" />

He, with a knowing&#10;look, locked the outer door upon her--then unlocked and opened the&#10;inner one, and calling out, &quot;Colonel, you're wanted,&quot; led her into the&#10;back parlour, which he occupied.&#10;&#10;Rawdon came in from the dining-parlour where all those people were&#10;carousing, into his back room; a flare of coarse light following him&#10;into the apartment where the lady stood, still very nervous.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is I, Rawdon,&quot; she said in a timid voice, which she strove to&#10;render cheerful.  &quot;It is Jane.&quot; Rawdon was quite overcome by that kind&#10;voice and presence.  He ran up to her--caught her in his arms--gasped&#10;out some inarticulate words of thanks and fairly sobbed on her&#10;shoulder.  She did not know the cause of his emotion.&#10;&#10;The bills of Mr. Moss were quickly settled, perhaps to the&#10;disappointment of that gentleman, who had counted on having the Colonel&#10;as his guest over Sunday at" />
    <node id=".  The elder Rawdon was thankful for the fondness of&#10;mother and daughter.  The very best and honestest feelings of the man&#10;came out in these artless outpourings of paternal feeling in which he&#10;indulged in their presence, and encouraged by their sympathy.  He&#10;secured not only Lady Jane's kindness, but her sincere regard, by the&#10;feelings which he manifested, and which he could not show to his own&#10;wife.  The two kinswomen met as seldom as possible. Becky laughed&#10;bitterly at Jane's feelings and softness; the other's kindly and gentle&#10;nature could not but revolt at her sister's callous behaviour.&#10;&#10;It estranged Rawdon from his wife more than he knew or acknowledged to&#10;himself.  She did not care for the estrangement.  Indeed, she did not&#10;miss him or anybody. She looked upon him as her errand-man and humble&#10;slave.  He might be ever so depressed or sulky, and she did not mark&#10;his demeanour, or only treated it with a sneer.  She was busy thinking&#10;about her position, or her pleasures, or her advancement in society;&#10;she ought to" />

For the truth is, our&#10;dear friend Rebecca had given him a most circumstantial narration of&#10;Briggs's delight at receiving her money--eleven hundred and twenty-five&#10;pounds--and in what securities she had invested it; and what a pang&#10;Becky herself felt in being obliged to pay away such a delightful sum&#10;of money.  &quot;Who knows,&quot; the dear woman may have thought within herself,&#10;&quot;perhaps he may give me a little more?&quot; My lord, however, made no such&#10;proposal to the little schemer--very likely thinking that he had been&#10;sufficiently generous already.&#10;&#10;He had the curiosity, then, to ask Miss Briggs about the state of her&#10;private affairs--and she told his lordship candidly what her position&#10;was" />

My lord asked&#10;how much the Colonel had already invested for her, and Miss Briggs at&#10;once and truly told him that the sum was six hundred and odd pounds.&#10;&#10;But as soon as she had told her story, the voluble Briggs repented of&#10;her frankness and besought my lord not to tell Mr. Crawley of the&#10;confessions which she had made.  &quot;The Colonel was so kind--Mr. Crawley&#10;might be offended and pay back the money, for which she could get no&#10;such good interest anywhere else.&quot; Lord Steyne, laughing, promised he&#10;never would divulge their conversation, and when he and Miss Briggs&#10;parted he laughed" />
    <node id="Two young men and Truffignyn played the role of messengers, personal shoppers, and debtors for Becky. They bought her gloves and flowers, went into debt for opera-boxes for her, and ran errands at her behest. These actions provided Becky with amusement and also entertained Lord Steyne, as she would mimic the young men's English and compliment them on their language skills to his amusement. Truffigny also gave a shawl to Becky's confidante, Briggs, in an attempt to win her favor. The simple and unsuspecting nature of these young men served as a source of amusement for both Becky and Lord Steyne, who found delight in their naivety." />
    <node id=" it is a well-known fact that he dared not go to the&#10;Travellers', where he owed money to the waiters, and if he had not had&#10;the Embassy as a dining-place, the worthy young gentleman must have&#10;starved.  I doubt, I say, that Becky would have selected either of&#10;these young men as a person on whom she would bestow her special&#10;regard.  They ran of her messages, purchased her gloves and flowers,&#10;went in debt for opera-boxes for her, and made themselves amiable in a&#10;thousand ways.  And they talked English with adorable simplicity, and&#10;to the constant amusement of Becky and my Lord Steyne, she would mimic&#10;one or other to his face, and compliment him on his advance in the&#10;English language with a gravity which never failed to tickle the&#10;Marquis, her sardonic old patron. Truffigny gave Briggs a shawl by way&#10;of winning over Becky's confidante, and asked her to take charge of a&#10;letter which the simple spinster handed over in public to the person to&#10;whom it was addressed, and the composition of which amused everybody&#10;who read it greatly.

He&#10;spoke of the honour of the family, the unsullied reputation of the&#10;Crawleys; expressed himself in indignant tones about her receiving&#10;those young Frenchmen--those wild young men of fashion, my Lord Steyne&#10;himself, whose carriage was always at her door, who passed hours daily&#10;in her company, and whose constant presence made the world talk about&#10;her.  As the head of the house he implored her to be more prudent.&#10;Society was already speaking lightly of her.  Lord Steyne, though a&#10;nobleman of the greatest station and talents, was a man whose&#10;attentions would compromise any woman; he besought, he implored, he&#10;commanded his sister-in-law to be watchful in her intercourse with that&#10;nobleman.&#10;&#10;Becky promised anything and everything Pitt wanted; but Lord Steyne&#10;came to her house as often" />
    <node id="illiancy of the latter had quite eclipsed her.  All voices were for&#10;her.  Stephens, Caradori, Ronzi de Begnis, people compared her to one&#10;or the other, and agreed with good reason, very likely, that had she&#10;been an actress none on the stage could have surpassed her. She had&#10;reached her culmination: her voice rose trilling and bright over the&#10;storm of applause, and soared as high and joyful as her triumph.  There&#10;was a ball after the dramatic entertainments, and everybody pressed&#10;round Becky as the great point of attraction of the evening.  The Royal&#10;Personage declared with an oath that she was perfection, and engaged&#10;her again and again in conversation.  Little Becky's soul swelled with&#10;pride and delight at these honours; she saw fortune, fame, fashion&#10;before her.  Lord Steyne was her slave, followed her everywhere, and&#10;scarcely spoke to any one in the room beside, and paid her the most&#10;marked compliments and attention.  She still appeared in her Marquise&#10;costume and danced a minuet with Monsieur de Truffigny, Monsieur Le Duc&#10;de la Jabot" />
    <node id=" by saying that his Lordship&#10;had been her father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Becky,&#10;had learned to honour and respect the Steyne family from the days of&#10;her childhood.  The fact is that Lord Steyne had once purchased a&#10;couple of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could&#10;never forget her gratitude for that favour.&#10;&#10;The Lady Bareacres then came under Becky's cognizance--to whom the&#10;Colonel's lady made also a most respectful obeisance:  it was returned&#10;with severe dignity by the exalted person in question.&#10;&#10;&quot;I had the pleasure of making your Ladyship's acquaintance at Brussels,&#10;ten years ago,&quot; Becky said in the most winning manner.  &quot;I had the good&#10;fortune to meet Lady Bareacres at the Duchess of Richmond's ball, the&#10;night before the Battle of Waterloo.  And I recollect your Ladyship,&#10;and my Lady Blanche, your daughter, sitting in the carriage in the&#10;porte-cochere at the Inn, waiting for horses. I hope your Ladyship's&#10;diamonds are safe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Everybody's eyes looked into their neighbour's.  The" />

She used to&#10;tell the great man her ennuis and perplexities in her artless way--they&#10;amused him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rawdon would make a very good Ecuyer--Master of the Ceremonies--what&#10;do you call him--the man in the large boots and the uniform, who goes&#10;round the ring cracking the whip? He is large, heavy, and of a military&#10;figure.  I recollect,&quot; Becky continued pensively, &quot;my father took me to&#10;see a show at Brookgreen Fair when I was a child, and when we came&#10;home, I made myself a pair of stilts and danced in the studio to the&#10;wonder of all the pupils.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I should have liked to see it,&quot; said Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;&quot;I should like" />
    <node id=" her intercourse with that&#10;nobleman.&#10;&#10;Becky promised anything and everything Pitt wanted; but Lord Steyne&#10;came to her house as often as ever, and Sir Pitt's anger increased. I&#10;wonder was Lady Jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found&#10;fault with his favourite Rebecca? Lord Steyne's visits continuing, his&#10;own ceased, and his wife was for refusing all further intercourse with&#10;that nobleman and declining the invitation to the charade-night which&#10;the marchioness sent to her; but Sir Pitt thought it was necessary to&#10;accept it, as his Royal Highness would be there.&#10;&#10;Although he went to the party in question, Sir Pitt quitted it very&#10;early, and his wife, too, was very glad to come away.  Becky hardly so&#10;much as spoke to him or noticed her sister-in-law.  Pitt Crawley&#10;declared her behaviour was monstrously indecorous, reprobated in strong&#10;terms the habit of play-acting and fancy dressing as highly unbecoming&#10;a British female, and after the charades were over, took his brother&#10;Rawdon severely to task for appearing himself and allowing his wife to&#10;join in such improper" />
    <node id="Rawdon Crawley, the character in question, is planning to confront a person named Lord Steyne with whom he has had a personal conflict. He mentions that this matter may end fatally for him and expresses his desire to make arrangements for his young son's care beforehand. Rawdon asks his brother Pitt to promise to take charge of the boy when he's gone, to which Pitt agrees. This agreement is made in light of Rawdon's financial difficulties and his feeling that his brother has not supported him as much as he could have in the past.&#10;&#10;Pitt promises to support Rawdon's son by becoming his friend and guardian, ensuring his well-being when Rawdon is no longer able to do so himself. Pitt does not make any explicit mention of providing financial support for the boy or helping Rawdon with his personal conflict, but he does shake Rawdon's hand with cordiality and agree to the proposed arrangement.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Rawdon feels a sense of gratitude towards his sister Jane and her husband Pitt because they have helped him during his financial difficulties, leading him to express a desire to improve himself as a result of their kindness." />

To an affair of that nature,&#10;of course, he said, there was but one issue, and after his conference&#10;with his brother, he was going away to make the necessary arrangements&#10;for the meeting which must ensue.  &quot;And as it may end fatally with me,&quot;&#10;Rawdon said with a broken voice, &quot;and as the boy has no mother, I must&#10;leave him to you and Jane, Pitt--only it will be a comfort to me if you&#10;will promise me to be his friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;The elder brother was much affected, and shook Rawdon's hand with a&#10;cordiality seldom exhibited by him. Rawdon passed his hand over his&#10;shaggy eyebrows. &quot;Thank you, brother,&quot; said he.  &quot;I know I can trust&#10;your word.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will, upon my honour,&quot; the Baronet said.  And thus, and almost&#10;mutely, this bargain was struck between them.&#10;&#10;Then Rawdon took out of his pocket the little pocket-book which he had" />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What is the matter, then?&quot; said Pitt, somewhat relieved.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's the boy,&quot; said Rawdon in a husky voice.  &quot;I want you to promise&#10;me that you will take charge of him when I'm gone.  That dear good wife&#10;of yours has always been good to him; and he's fonder of her than he is&#10;of his . . .--Damn it.  Look here, Pitt--you know that I was to have&#10;had Miss Crawley's money.  I wasn't brought up like a younger brother,&#10;but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kep idle.  But for this&#10;I might have been quite a different man.  I didn't do my duty with the&#10;regiment so bad.  You know how I was thrown over about the money, and&#10;who got it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;After the sacrifices I have made, and the manner in which I have stood&#10;by you, I think this sort of reproach is useless,&quot; Sir Pitt said.&#10;&quot;Your marriage was your own doing, not mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's over now,&quot; said Rawdon.  &quot;That's over now.&quot; And the words were&#10;wrenched" />

Even the hundred pounds that Jane took you last night were&#10;promised to my lawyer to-morrow morning, and the want of it will put me&#10;to great inconvenience. I don't mean to say that I won't assist you&#10;ultimately. But as for paying your creditors in full, I might as well&#10;hope to pay the National Debt.  It is madness, sheer madness, to think&#10;of such a thing.  You must come to a compromise.  It's a painful thing&#10;for the family, but everybody does it.  There was George Kitely, Lord&#10;Ragland's son, went through the Court last week, and was what they call&#10;whitewashed, I believe. Lord Ragland would not pay a shilling for him,&#10;and--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's not money I want,&quot; Rawdon broke in.  &quot;I'm not come to you about&#10;myself.  Never mind what happens to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What is the matter, then?&quot; said Pitt, somewhat relieved.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's the boy,&quot; said Rawdon in a husky" />

Having made comments upon this entertainment to&#10;the housekeeper and her niece as they were taking early tea and hot&#10;buttered toast in the former lady's apartment, and wondered how the&#10;Rawding Crawleys could git on, the valet had damped and folded the&#10;paper once more, so that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the&#10;arrival of the master of the house.&#10;&#10;Poor Rawdon took up the paper and began to try and read it until his&#10;brother should arrive.  But the print fell blank upon his eyes, and he&#10;did not know in the least what he was reading.

    <node id="Lady Jane and Sir Pitt insisted that Rawdon accompany Rebecca to social events and have a chaperone for her due to their concern about Rebecca's behavior and the company she was keeping, specifically Lord Steyne. They believed that Rebecca was too clever and sociable to be allowed to go from party to party without a companion, and they wanted Rawdon to act as a guardian for her. However, Rawdon had his own issues with Lord Steyne and felt that he needed to confront him regarding their personal conflict, which could potentially end fatally for him. Therefore, before doing so, he made arrangements for his young son's care by asking Pitt to promise to take charge of the boy when he's gone.&#10;&#10;Despite knowing about Lord Steyne's protection being crucial for Rawdon's safety and their family's delicate interests, Lady Jane and Sir Pitt still insisted on dismissing Rebecca's loyal maid Briggs and having a chaperone for her. This could be due to their belief that the presence of a trusted family member or guardian would ensure Rebecca's safety and decorum in social events, as well as prevent any further issues with Lord Steyne. However, this decision ultimately caused two of Rawdon's &quot;out-sentinels&quot; to be in the hands of the enemy, leaving him vulnerable and potentially at risk." />

But in the meantime it was clear that&#10;honest Briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life, and so&#10;she and her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey. And so&#10;two of Rawdon's out-sentinels were in the hands of the enemy.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt went and expostulated with his sister-in-law upon the subject&#10;of the dismissal of Briggs and other matters of delicate family&#10;interest.  In vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the&#10;protection of Lord Steyne for her poor husband; how cruel it would be&#10;on their part to deprive Briggs of the position offered to her.&#10;Cajole" />

Lady&#10;Jane, in her morning-gown, was up and above stairs in the nursery&#10;superintending the toilettes of her children and listening to the&#10;morning prayers which the little creatures performed at her knee.&#10;Every morning she and they performed this duty privately, and before&#10;the public ceremonial at which Sir Pitt presided and at which all the&#10;people of the household were expected to assemble.

The Colonel told his&#10;senior briefly, and in broken accents, the circumstances of the case.&#10;&quot;It was a regular plan between that scoundrel and her,&quot; he said.  &quot;The&#10;bailiffs were put upon me; I was taken as I was going out of his house;&#10;when I wrote to her for money, she said she was ill in bed and put me&#10;off to another day.

    <node id="Rawdon Crawley, the protagonist's brother, wished to take the life of Lord Steyne after discovering his wife Becky in diamonds and alone with him. This discovery came after Rawdon had a financial dispute with Becky, as he was taken as a bailiff while leaving Lord Steyne's house and received no assistance from Becky when he wrote to her for money.&#10;&#10;When Rawdon returned home, he found Becky sitting with Lord Steyne, who had given her diamonds and other expensive gifts that Rawdon had spent on her behalf. This revelation led Rawdon to believe that there was a &quot;regular plan&quot; between Becky and Lord Steyne, which caused him to wish harm upon both of them.&#10;&#10;The narrative suggests that Rawdon's desire for vengeance stemmed from the betrayal he felt after discovering his wife's infidelity, as well as the financial strain and humiliation he had experienced due to their financial difficulties." />

Rawdon heard&#10;laughter within--laughter and singing. Becky was singing a snatch of&#10;the song of the night before; a hoarse voice shouted &quot;Brava!&#10;Brava!&quot;--it was Lord Steyne's.&#10;&#10;Rawdon opened the door and went in.  A little table with a dinner was&#10;laid out--and wine and plate.  Steyne was hanging over the sofa on&#10;which Becky sat.  The wretched woman was in a brilliant full toilette,&#10;her arms and all her fingers sparkling with bracelets and rings, and&#10;the brilliants on her breast which Steyne had given her. He had her&#10;hand in his, and was bowing over it to kiss it, when Becky started up&#10;with a faint scream as she caught sight of Rawdon's white face.  At the&#10;next instant she tried a smile, a horrid smile, as if to welcome her&#10;husband; and Steyne rose up, grinding his teeth, pale, and with fury in&#10;his looks.&#10;&#10;He, too, attempted" />

How d'ye do, Crawley?&quot; he said, the nerves of his&#10;mouth twitching as he tried to grin at the intruder.&#10;&#10;There was that in Rawdon's face which caused Becky to fling herself&#10;before him.  &quot;I am innocent, Rawdon,&quot; she said; &quot;before God, I am&#10;innocent.&quot; She clung hold of his coat, of his hands; her own were all&#10;covered with serpents, and rings, and baubles.  &quot;I am innocent. Say I&#10;am innocent,&quot; she said to Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;He thought a trap had been laid for him, and was as furious with the&#10;wife as with the husband.  &quot;You innocent!  Damn you,&quot; he screamed out.&#10;&quot;You innocent!  Why every trinket you have on your body is paid for by&#10;me.

His father's influence and status as a Colonel and C.B., as well as his connection to a County member and Lord Steyne, likely played a role in the favorable treatment he received from the school authorities. He had plenty of pocket money, which he used to buy treats for his comrades, and was often allowed to visit his father on weekends. Rawdon Sr. took him to the play or sent him with a footman, and on Sundays, he attended church with his aunt, uncle, and cousins. The narrative suggests that young Rawdon was well-liked and integrated into school life, making friends and learning the names of the masters and principal boys.

As a protege&#10;of the great Lord Steyne, the nephew of a County member, and son of a&#10;Colonel and C.B., whose name appeared in some of the most fashionable&#10;parties in the Morning Post, perhaps the school authorities were&#10;disposed not to look unkindly on the child.  He had plenty of&#10;pocket-money, which he spent in treating his comrades royally to&#10;raspberry tarts, and he was often allowed to come home on Saturdays to&#10;his father, who always made a jubilee of that day. When free, Rawdon&#10;would take him to the play, or send him thither with the footman; and&#10;on Sundays he went to church with Briggs and Lady Jane and his cousins.&#10;Rawdon marvelled over his stories about school, and fights, and&#10;fagging.

But the mother and son never could be brought together.&#10;&#10;And it was while Rawdon's mind was agitated with these doubts and&#10;perplexities that the incident occurred which was mentioned in the last&#10;chapter, and the unfortunate Colonel found himself a prisoner away from&#10;home.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;A Rescue and a Catastrophe&#10;&#10;Friend Rawdon drove on then to Mr. Moss's mansion in Cursitor Street,&#10;and was duly inducted into that dismal place of hospitality.

    <node id="Rawdon Crawley, the protagonist's brother, discovered his wife Becky's betrayal when he came home after a financial dispute with her. He had gone to her for money, but she did not assist him, which led to his arrest by bailiffs as he left Lord Steyne's house. When he returned home, he found Becky sitting alone with Lord Steyne, who had given her diamonds and other expensive gifts that Rawdon had previously bought for her. This discovery led Rawdon to believe that there was a &quot;regular plan&quot; between Becky and Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;Rawdon's desire for vengeance stemmed from the betrayal he felt after discovering his wife's infidelity, as well as the financial strain and humiliation he had experienced due to their financial difficulties. He blamed himself for the situation because he felt that he had failed to protect his wife and family from Lord Steyne's influence, which ultimately led to Becky's betrayal and his own financial ruin. This sense of guilt and failure is what led Rawdon to wish harm upon both Becky and Lord Steyne." />

Rawdon muttered some&#10;excuses about an engagement, squeezing hard the timid little hand which&#10;his sister-in-law reached out to him.

That day they arranged together the preliminaries of the&#10;treaty of capitulation.&#10;&#10;George was kept from school the next day, and saw his aunt.  Amelia&#10;left them alone together and went to her room.  She was trying the&#10;separation--as that poor gentle Lady Jane Grey felt the edge of the axe&#10;that was to come down and sever her slender life.  Days were passed in&#10;parleys, visits, preparations.  The widow broke the matter to Georgy&#10;with great caution; she looked to see him very much affected by the&#10;intelligence.  He was rather elated than otherwise, and the poor woman&#10;turned sadly away.  He bragged about the news that day to the boys at&#10;school; told them how he was going to live with his grandpapa, his&#10;father's father, not the one who comes here sometimes; and that he&#10;" />

It was that she&#10;was conquered.  The sentence was passed.  The child must go from&#10;her--to others--to forget her.  Her heart and her treasure--her joy,&#10;hope, love, worship--her God, almost!  She must give him up, and&#10;then--and then she would go to George, and they would watch over the&#10;child and wait for him until he came to them in Heaven.&#10;&#10;She put on her bonnet, scarcely knowing what she did, and went out to&#10;walk in the lanes by which George used to come back from school, and&#10;where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy.  It&#10;was May, a half-holiday.  The leaves were all coming out, the weather&#10;was brilliant; the boy came running to her flushed with health,&#10;singing, his bundle of school-books hanging by a thong. There he was.&#10;Both her arms were round him.  No, it" />

How she owns that it is she and not the&#10;man who is guilty; how she takes all the faults on her side; how she&#10;courts in a manner punishment for the wrongs which she has not&#10;committed and persists in shielding the real culprit!  It is those who&#10;injure women who get the most kindness from them--they are born timid&#10;and tyrants and maltreat those who are humblest before them.&#10;&#10;So poor Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her son's&#10;departure, and had passed many and many a long solitary hour in making&#10;preparations for the end. George stood by his mother, watching her&#10;arrangements without the least concern.

He mentioned the names and titles of all the guests, giving&#10;biographical sketches of the principal people.  He described the&#10;persons of the ladies with great eloquence; the service of the table;&#10;the size and costume of the servants; enumerated the dishes and wines&#10;served; the ornaments of the sideboard; and the probable value of the&#10;plate.  Such a dinner he calculated could not be dished up under&#10;fifteen or eighteen dollars per head. And he was in the habit, until&#10;very lately, of sending over proteges, with letters of recommendation&#10;to the present Marquis of Steyne, encouraged to do so by the intimate&#10;terms on which he had lived with his dear friend, the late lord.  He&#10;was most indignant that a young and insignificant aristocrat, the Earl&#10;of Southdown, should have taken the pas of him in their procession to&#10;the dining-room.  &quot;Just as I was stepping up to offer my hand to a&#10;very pleasing" />

He waxed his mustachios into a state of brilliant&#10;polish and put on a tight cravat and a trim buff waistcoat, so that all&#10;the young officers in the mess-room, whither Crawley had preceded his&#10;friend, complimented Mac on his appearance at breakfast and asked if he&#10;was going to be married that Sunday.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

His Royal Highness the late lamented&#10;Commander-in-Chief had had the greatest regard for Macmurdo on this&#10;account, and he was the common refuge of gentlemen in trouble.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the row about, Crawley, my boy?&quot; said the old warrior.  &quot;No&#10;more gambling business, hay, like that when we shot Captain Marker?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's about--about my wife,&quot; Crawley answered, casting down his eyes&#10;and turning very red.&#10;&#10;The other gave a" />

The fact that the Aga was given Mesrour by an Egyptian pasha in exchange for three dozen of Maraschino highlights the idea of Eastern bartering and haggling, as well as the perceived exoticness and otherness of these characters.

The vacant bed in his dressing room where little Rawdon used to sleep reminded him of his absence, and he tried unsuccessfully to walk in the park without him. His feelings for his son were such that even Becky laughed at his sentimental reaction, which highlighted his emotional attachment to the child.&#10;&#10;Upon returning home, Rawdon was kind and grateful towards Briggs, feeling remorseful about borrowing her money and deceiving her. He and Briggs talked extensively about their shared concern for the boy's wellbeing, as Becky only came home to dress and go out. Later that day, Rawdon visited Lady Jane, informing her of what had happened and expressing his gratitude for her care towards his son.&#10;&#10;Rawdon marvelled at his son's stories about school life, fights, and fagging, quickly learning the names of all the masters and principal boys, as well as those of his son's companions. He made an effort to ensure his son had a good experience at school by tipping the headmaster and allowing him to come home on weekends, taking him to the play or sending him with the footman. On Sundays, Rawdon's son went to church with Briggs and Lady Jane, further integrating him into their lives." />

His conscience smote him that he had borrowed Briggs's money&#10;and aided in deceiving her.  They talked about little Rawdon a long&#10;time, for Becky only came home to dress and go out to dinner--and then&#10;he went off uneasily to drink tea with Lady Jane, and tell her of what&#10;had happened, and how little Rawdon went off like a trump, and how he&#10;was to wear a gown and little knee-breeches, and how young Blackball,&#10;Jack Blackball's son, of the old regiment, had taken him in charge" />

He looked&#10;often and wistfully at the little vacant bed in his dressing-room,&#10;where the child used to sleep.

He liked the people who&#10;were fond of him, and would go and sit for long hours with his&#10;good-natured sister Lady Jane, and talk to her about the virtues, and&#10;good looks, and hundred good qualities of the child.&#10;&#10;Young Rawdon's aunt, we have said, was very fond of him, as was her&#10;little girl, who wept copiously when the time for her cousin's&#10;departure came.

Despite her attempts to socialize and follow the great ladies to different locations in the room, they consistently ignored or marginalized her. Even when Lady Steyne intervened and asked Becky to sing for her, the other ladies did not warm up to her presence. This behavior made Becky realize that, despite her best efforts, she was not truly accepted by the high-society women due to her lower social status. This experience validated Lord Steyne's warning about the potential pitfalls of trying to integrate into a sphere above her own." />

When Becky followed them to the&#10;table of drawings, they dropped off one by one to the fire again.  She&#10;tried to speak to one of the children (of whom she was commonly fond in&#10;public places), but Master George Gaunt was called away by his mamma;&#10;and the stranger was treated with such cruelty finally, that even Lady&#10;Steyne herself pitied her and went up to speak to the friendless little&#10;woman.&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord Steyne,&quot; said her Ladyship, as her wan cheeks glowed with a&#10;blush, &quot;says you sing and play very beautifully, Mrs. Crawley--I wish&#10;you would do me the kindness to sing to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will do anything that may give pleasure to my Lord Steyne or to&#10;you,&quot; said Rebecca, sincerely grateful," />

Wenham, the wit and lawyer, Lord Steyne's&#10;right-hand man, went about everywhere praising her:  some who had&#10;hesitated, came forward at once and welcomed her; little Tom Toady, who&#10;had warned Southdown about visiting such an abandoned woman, now&#10;besought to be introduced to her.

    <node id="The scene described is a charade performance at Gaunt House, where the Marquis of Steyne has invited distinguished guests. The arrival of these guests is met with excitement and amusement, with reactions such as applause and confusion. One of the charades performed is an opera called 'Le Rossignol,' which was originally a French ballet and has been transferred to the English stage by Mr. Wagg. The characters in the opera include Little Lord Southdown, dressed as an old woman, and Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, who appears as a Marquise. The audience is entertained by their performance and praises their singing.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, at John Sedley's humble tenement in Brompton, there is a different atmosphere. Mrs. Sedley, the landlady, is in a difficult financial situation and is struggling to pay her rent. She is also worried about her daughter Rebecca, who she believes is guilty of some wrongdoing, but she is not sure what it is.&#10;&#10;In another part of town, Lord Steyne visits Miss Briggs, Rebecca's former maid, to gather information about Rebecca's finances. He casually asks Miss Briggs about her private affairs and learns that Rebecca has not given any money to Miss Briggs, contrary to what Rebecca had told him. This helps Lord Steyne to satisfy his suspicions and gives him leverage in his dealings with Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Finally, the scene shifts back to the charade performance at Gaunt House, where the audience is captivated by the opera 'Le Rossignol.'

These pictures were given to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment and settled into quiet life, indicating that he has been in the military for a long time and has a wide network of friends and acquaintances. As a veteran officer and Waterloo man who is well-liked in his regiment, it can be inferred that Mr. Macmurdo is experienced, respected, and possibly quite popular among his peers.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Amelia Sedley has already taken several steps towards preparing for her son's departure to live with his wealthy grandfather. She has purchased items for his use, marked his books and linen, and talked with him about the change. However, now that she has fully realized she must let go of her child for their sake, the narrative suggests a few things she can do:&#10;&#10;1. Seek support: Amelia has been dealing with this situation alone, but she could benefit from seeking support from others. This could include confiding in a trusted friend or family member, such as Miss Osborne, who has already shown compassion towards her.&#10;2. Take care of herself: The narrative mentions that Amelia is growing more care-worn and sad each day. She must remember to take care of herself physically, emotionally, and mentally to be able to cope with the separation.&#10;3. Focus on the future: Although it will be difficult, Amelia must try to look forward to the future and the new opportunities that await both her and her son. This may involve exploring new hobbies or activities that she can enjoy on her own.&#10;4. Maintain a relationship with her son: Even though George will be living with his grandfather, Amelia can still maintain a relationship with him through regular visits, letters, and phone calls. By doing so, she can assure herself and George that their bond remains strong despite the physical separation.&#10;5. Let go of guilt: The narrative mentions that Amelia feels guilty for denying her son certain rights and pleasures due to her selfish love for him. However, it is essential to recognize that the situation is not her fault and that she is making a selfless sacrifice for her child's well-being. By letting go of guilt, Amelia can focus on healing and moving forward." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Becky imagines herself in various roles that she perceives as more exciting and fulfilling than her current life with her husband Rawdon Crawley. These roles include being a parson's wife, a sergeant's lady, and a dancer at a fair. She also suggests the role of an Ecuyer or Master of Ceremonies for Rawdon. Becky expresses her boredom and dissatisfaction with her current life, which highlights her growing contempt for her husband and her desire to pursue her own interests.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne's reactions to Becky's musings reveal his feelings towards her. He finds her perplexities and desires amusing, indicating his sense of superiority and enjoyment of her company. Lord Steyne is a powerful and wealthy man who takes pleasure in indulging in Becky's company, and his laughter reflects his belief that she is an entertaining companion. However, their relationship is unequal and exploitative, as he takes advantage of her naivety and desire for social acceptance to further his own interests.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative highlights the power dynamic between Becky and Lord Steyne, with the latter using his wealth and influence to manipulate and control the former.

He&#10;left off his clubs and billiards.  He never left home.  He took Becky&#10;out to drive; he went laboriously with her to all her parties.

And when Becky&#10;proposed to go out without her husband, or received invitations for&#10;herself, he peremptorily ordered her to refuse them: and there was that&#10;in the gentleman's manner which enforced obedience.  Little Becky, to&#10;do her justice, was charmed with Rawdon's gallantry.  If he was surly,&#10;she never was.

However, Rawdon had his own issues with Lord Steyne and felt that he needed to confront him regarding their personal conflict, which could potentially end fatally for him. Therefore, before doing so, he made arrangements for his young son's care by asking Pitt to promise to take charge of the boy when he's gone.&#10;&#10;Despite knowing about Lord Steyne's protection being crucial for Rawdon's safety and their family's delicate interests, Lady Jane and Sir Pitt still insisted on dismissing Rebecca's loyal maid Briggs and having a chaperone for her. This could be due to their belief that the presence of a trusted family member or guardian would ensure Rebecca's safety and decorum in social events, as well as prevent any further issues with Lord Steyne. However, this decision ultimately caused two of Rawdon's &quot;out-sentinels&quot; to be in the hands of the enemy, leaving him vulnerable and potentially at risk.">

This discovery led Rawdon to believe that there was a &quot;regular plan&quot; between Becky and Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;Rawdon's desire for vengeance stemmed from the betrayal he felt after discovering his wife's infidelity, as well as the financial strain and humiliation he had experienced due to their financial difficulties.

Later that day, Rawdon visited Lady Jane, informing her of what had happened and expressing his gratitude for her care towards his son.&#10;&#10;Rawdon marvelled at his son's stories about school life, fights, and fagging, quickly learning the names of all the masters and principal boys, as well as those of his son's companions. He made an effort to ensure his son had a good experience at school by tipping the headmaster and allowing him to come home on weekends, taking him to the play or sending him with the footman. On Sundays, Rawdon's son went to church with Briggs and Lady Jane, further integrating him into their lives.">

This further widens the rift between Becky and Rawdon, contributing to Rawdon's eventual desire for vengeance against his wife and Lord Steyne.

This sense of guilt and failure is what led Rawdon to wish harm upon both Becky and Lord Steyne." target="In the narrative, Becky imagines herself in various roles that she perceives as more exciting and fulfilling than her current life with her husband Rawdon Crawley. These roles include being a parson's wife, a sergeant's lady, and a dancer at a fair. She also suggests the role of an Ecuyer or Master of Ceremonies for Rawdon. Becky expresses her boredom and dissatisfaction with her current life, which highlights her growing contempt for her husband and her desire to pursue her own interests.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne's reactions to Becky's musings reveal his feelings towards her. He finds her perplexities and desires amusing, indicating his sense of superiority and enjoyment of her company. Lord Steyne is a powerful and wealthy man who takes pleasure in indulging in Becky's company, and his laughter reflects his belief that she is an entertaining companion. However, their relationship is unequal and exploitative, as he takes advantage of her naivety and desire for social acceptance to further his own interests.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative highlights the power dynamic between Becky and Lord Steyne, with the latter using his wealth and influence to manipulate and control the former. It also reveals Becky's growing disillusionment with her life with Rawdon and her desire for a more exciting and fulfilling existence, which ultimately leads to her betrayal and downfall.">

His feelings for his son were such that even Becky laughed at his sentimental reaction, which highlighted his emotional attachment to the child.&#10;&#10;Upon returning home, Rawdon was kind and grateful towards Briggs, feeling remorseful about borrowing her money and deceiving her.

On Sundays, Rawdon's son went to church with Briggs and Lady Jane, further integrating him into their lives.">

These roles include being a parson's wife, a sergeant's lady, and a dancer at a fair. She also suggests the role of an Ecuyer or Master of Ceremonies for Rawdon. Becky expresses her boredom and dissatisfaction with her current life, which highlights her growing contempt for her husband and her desire to pursue her own interests.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne's reactions to Becky's musings reveal his feelings towards her. He finds her perplexities and desires amusing, indicating his sense of superiority and enjoyment of her company. Lord Steyne is a powerful and wealthy man who takes pleasure in indulging in Becky's company, and his laughter reflects his belief that she is an entertaining companion. However, their relationship is unequal and exploitative, as he takes advantage of her naivety and desire for social acceptance to further his own interests.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative highlights the power dynamic between Becky and Lord Steyne, with the latter using his wealth and influence to manipulate and control the former.

The arrival of these guests is met with excitement and amusement, with reactions such as applause and confusion. One of the charades performed is an opera called 'Le Rossignol,' which was originally a French ballet and has been transferred to the English stage by Mr. Wagg. The characters in the opera include Little Lord Southdown, dressed as an old woman, and Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, who appears as a Marquise. The audience is entertained by their performance and praises their singing.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, at John Sedley's humble tenement in Brompton, there is a different atmosphere. Mrs. Sedley, the landlady, is in a difficult financial situation and is struggling to pay her rent. She is also worried about her daughter Rebecca, who she believes is guilty of some wrongdoing, but she is not sure what it is.&#10;&#10;In another part of town, Lord Steyne visits Miss Briggs, Rebecca's former maid, to gather information about Rebecca's finances. He casually asks Miss Briggs about her private affairs and learns that Rebecca has not given any money to Miss Briggs, contrary to what Rebecca had told him. This helps Lord Steyne to satisfy his suspicions and gives him leverage in his dealings with Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Finally, the scene shifts back to the charade performance at Gaunt House, where the audience is captivated by the opera 'Le Rossignol.' The characters' actions and the performance of the opera provide a stark contrast to the struggles and concerns of the characters in the other scenes described.">

It had been so used when George&#10;III was king; and a picture of the Marquis of Gaunt is still extant,&#10;with his hair in powder and a pink ribbon, in a Roman shape, as it was&#10;called, enacting the part of Cato in Mr. Addison's tragedy of that&#10;name, performed before their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales, the&#10;Bishop of Osnaburgh, and Prince William Henry, then children like the&#10;actor.

    <edge source="Rebecca's singing of religious songs has a significant emotional impact on Lady Steyne. The sweetness and tenderness of her singing evoke memories of Lady Steyne's early, happy days in a convent garden, causing her to forget the rumors and buzzing from the opposition ladies at the party. The power of music and nostalgia transports her back to her childhood, creating a strong emotional connection between Lady Steyne and Rebecca. This moment also highlights Rebecca's manipulation skills, as she consciously chooses religious songs that she knows will appeal to Lady Steyne's emotions, further strengthening their bond." target=" to sing to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will do anything that may give pleasure to my Lord Steyne or to&#10;you,&quot; said Rebecca, sincerely grateful, and seating herself at the&#10;piano, began to sing.&#10;&#10;She sang religious songs of Mozart, which had been early favourites of&#10;Lady Steyne, and with such sweetness and tenderness that the lady,&#10;lingering round the piano, sat down by its side and listened until the&#10;tears rolled down her eyes.  It is true that the opposition ladies at&#10;the other end of the room kept up a loud and ceaseless buzzing and&#10;talking, but the Lady Steyne did not hear those rumours.  She was a&#10;child again--and had wandered back through a forty years' wilderness to&#10;her convent garden.  The chapel organ had pealed the same tones, the&#10;organist, the sister whom she loved best of the community, had taught&#10;them to her in those early happy days.  She was a girl once more, and&#10;the brief period of her happiness bloomed out again for an hour--she&#10;started when the jarring doors were flung open, and with a loud laugh&#10;from Lord Steyne, the men of the party entered full">

    <edge source="Mr. Macmurdo is spending a quiet morning in bed, reading an account of a fight between the Tutbury Pet and the Barking Butcher in Bell's Life. The description of his bedroom, which is hung with boxing, sporting, and dancing pictures, suggests that he has a strong interest in physical pursuits such as sports and dance. These pictures were given to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment and settled into quiet life, indicating that he has been in the military for a long time and has a wide network of friends and acquaintances. As a veteran officer and Waterloo man who is well-liked in his regiment, it can be inferred that Mr. Macmurdo is experienced, respected, and possibly quite popular among his peers. The fact that he is nearly fifty years old and has spent twenty-four of those years in the military also suggests that he is dedicated to his service and well-respected by his comrades." target=" night before by Captain the&#10;Honourable George Cinqbars, at his house in Brompton Square, to several&#10;young men of the regiment, and a number of ladies of the corps de&#10;ballet, and old Mac, who was at home with people of all ages and ranks,&#10;and consorted with generals, dog-fanciers, opera-dancers, bruisers, and&#10;every kind of person, in a word, was resting himself after the night's&#10;labours, and, not being on duty, was in bed.&#10;&#10;His room was hung round with boxing, sporting, and dancing pictures,&#10;presented to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment, and&#10;married and settled into quiet life.

    <edge source="Colonel Crawley invested six hundred and odd pounds for Miss Briggs. Miss Briggs asked Lord Steyne not to reveal her financial situation to Mr. Crawley because she was worried that Mr. Crawley might be offended and demand the return of the money, which she would have difficulty replacing since she could not get such a good interest rate elsewhere." target=" which I deceived you.  It was he&#10;who, foreseeing that questions might be asked regarding the disposal of&#10;the money, forced me to account for it as I did.  He took the money.&#10;He told me he had paid Miss Briggs; I did not want, I did not dare to&#10;doubt him. Pardon the wrong which a desperate man is forced to commit,&#10;and pity a miserable, miserable woman.&quot; She burst into tears as she&#10;spoke.  Persecuted virtue never looked more bewitchingly wretched.&#10;&#10;They had a long conversation, driving round and round the Regent's Park&#10;in Mrs. Crawley's carriage together, a conversation of which it is not&#10;necessary to repeat the details, but the upshot of it was that, when&#10;Becky came home, she flew to her dear Briggs with a smiling face and&#10;announced that she had some very good news for her. Lord Steyne had&#10;acted in the noblest and most generous manner.  He was always thinking&#10;how and when he could do good.

    <edge source="In the narrative, Becky imagines herself in various roles that she perceives as more exciting and fulfilling than her current life with her husband Rawdon Crawley. These roles include being a parson's wife, a sergeant's lady, and a dancer at a fair. She also suggests the role of an Ecuyer or Master of Ceremonies for Rawdon. Becky expresses her boredom and dissatisfaction with her current life, which highlights her growing contempt for her husband and her desire to pursue her own interests.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne's reactions to Becky's musings reveal his feelings towards her. He finds her perplexities and desires amusing, indicating his sense of superiority and enjoyment of her company. Lord Steyne is a powerful and wealthy man who takes pleasure in indulging in Becky's company, and his laughter reflects his belief that she is an entertaining companion. However, their relationship is unequal and exploitative, as he takes advantage of her naivety and desire for social acceptance to further his own interests.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative highlights the power dynamic between Becky and Lord Steyne, with the latter using his wealth and influence to manipulate and control the former. It also reveals Becky's growing disillusionment with her life with Rawdon and her desire for a more exciting and fulfilling existence, which ultimately leads to her betrayal and downfall." target=" female, and after the charades were over, took his brother&#10;Rawdon severely to task for appearing himself and allowing his wife to&#10;join in such improper exhibitions.&#10;&#10;Rawdon said she should not join in any more such amusements--but&#10;indeed, and perhaps from hints from his elder brother and sister, he&#10;had already become a very watchful and exemplary domestic character. He&#10;left off his clubs and billiards.  He never left home.  He took Becky&#10;out to drive; he went laboriously with her to all her parties. Whenever&#10;my Lord Steyne called, he was sure to find the Colonel. And when Becky&#10;proposed to go out without her husband, or received invitations for&#10;herself, he peremptorily ordered her to refuse them: and there was that&#10;in the gentleman's manner which enforced obedience.  Little Becky, to&#10;do her justice, was charmed with Rawdon's gallantry.  If he was surly,&#10;she never was. Whether friends were present or absent, she had always a&#10;kind smile for him and was attentive to his pleasure and comfort.

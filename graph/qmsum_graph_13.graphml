    <node id="Based on the transcript, the idea of incorporating the user manual into the remote control with a help button was brought up by the project manager and was met with approval from the industrial designer and user interface designer. The marketing team also suggested having a LCD display on the remote itself, which could show a menu for changing programs and adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, and contrast. However, the industrial designer raised concerns about looking at the LCD display instead of the TV screen. To address this issue, it was proposed to have the user interface displayed on the TV screen, which would reduce the need for many buttons on the remote control and make it more user-friendly. Overall, the team was discussing various design possibilities for the remote control and how to make it as user-friendly as possible, with the idea of incorporating a help button and displaying usage instructions on the TV screen being one of the proposed solutions." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control {gap} and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . That's a good idea .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: To have a help button .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: A help button .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So you are display on the screen .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: On T_V_ T_V_ screen .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So {disfmarker} on the T_V_ screen .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: On the T_V_ screen .

    <node id="The purpose of this design feature is to remind users to return their TV remote control to its charger when they are finished using it. This is accomplished by having a small button on the charger that, when pressed, causes the remote control to beep, making it easier to locate if it has been misplaced. The benefit of this feature is that it ensures that the remote control is always charged and ready for use, and also reduces the frustration of lost remotes. This feature may be especially beneficial for people who are forgetful or easily distracted, as well as those who use the TV frequently and want to ensure that their remote control is always ready for use. Additionally, this feature promotes good habits for taking care of electronic devices by encouraging users to return them to their chargers when not in use." />
    <node id="aker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Yes .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So this were the findings which we found .

    <node id="1. Aesthetics are important to users, with 70% finding their current remotes ugly and 80% willing to pay more for a fancy design.&#10;2. Users want a remote control that matches their operating behavior. 75% of users reported &quot;zapping&quot; (quickly switching channels) frequently.&#10;3. Many users only utilize a small fraction of the buttons on their remotes, with 50% saying they use only 10% of the buttons and 90% of buttons being rarely used.&#10;4. There is interest in a user-customizable remote control suitable for both kids and older people. This idea was presented as a remote with a cap that can be used by kids, and if removed, becomes more suitable for adults. The industrial designer suggested understanding what users want before proceeding with this concept.&#10;5. The marketing team conducted a survey to gather user preferences and find features that differentiate their remote control from others.

    <node id="1. Reducing the number of buttons: The user interface designer pointed out that many remotes have too many buttons, which can be confusing. One proposed solution is to reduce the number of buttons on the remote control.&#10;2. Incorporating a help button: The project manager suggested incorporating a help button into the remote control that would provide usage instructions on the TV screen. This could help reduce confusion and make the remote control easier to use.&#10;3. Voice recognition technology: User interface designer mentioned an email from another department about using voice recognition technology in a coffee machine, where users can say &quot;good morning&quot; and the machine will reply. The team agreed to consider this technology for the remote control design. Voice recognition could help reduce the number of buttons needed on the remote control and make it more user-friendly.&#10;4. Spinning wheel navigation: User interface designer also mentioned that some people use a spinning wheel as a navigation tool. This could be another way to reduce the number of buttons on the remote control while still providing easy navigation for users.&#10;5.

Security measures: Although not explicitly discussed in the transcript, one potential security measure for special users such as children and older adults could be incorporating a PIN code or password protection feature into the remote control to prevent unauthorized use. Additionally, reducing the number of buttons and incorporating voice recognition technology could also help simplify the user interface and reduce the risk of accidentally changing settings or accessing unintended features." />
    <node id="1. Charging Function: The transcript does not provide specific details about the proposed charging function for the remote control. However, it mentions the use of &quot;kinetic metal&quot; as a potential option for generating power through user movement. This could potentially be used to charge the remote when it is not in use.&#10;2. Feature to Locate the Remote: The transcript suggests incorporating a vocal command, such as &quot;find,&quot; to make the remote control beep or light up when it is misplaced. This would help reduce frustration and make it easier for users to locate their remote controls." />
    <node id="1. Pre-requirements for using voice commands: The marketing team suggested specifying some pre-requirements for using voice commands, such as requiring a silent environment or providing an option to switch the feature on or off.&#10;2. Potential solutions for implementing voice commands: The team discussed using voice recognition technology in the remote control design, which could help reduce the number of buttons needed and make it more user-friendly. They also mentioned an example of using voice recognition technology in a coffee machine where users can say &quot;good morning&quot; and the machine will reply.&#10;3.

User Manual: Displaying usage instructions on the TV screen using a help button can assist users with any confusion or difficulties they may encounter while operating the remote control. This eliminates the need for an LCD display on the remote itself, reducing production costs and making it more user-friendly for all users.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the most essential features to include in the remote control design are simple navigation buttons, a help button with usage instructions displayed on the TV screen, voice recognition technology, security measures, and a feature to locate the remote using vocal commands. Keeping costs down can be achieved by exploring the feasibility of kinetic metal technology for charging the remote when it is not in use and eliminating the need for an LCD display on the remote itself." />
    <node id="The discussion revolves around the idea of adding a prefix before channel numbers to help distinguish between different types of &quot;twenty five&quot; when spoken aloud. The marketing team suggests that this could be beneficial as there may not be a strong preference among users for having a prefix before a channel number, but rather, there is interest in finding ways to make it easier and more intuitive for users to access their preferred channels without relying on memorizing specific channel numbers. However, the user interface designer raises concerns about potential confusion between voice commands and channel numbers, especially when using numbers in channel names or when the score comes up during a sports game. The team also discusses other alternatives such as allowing users to call a channel directly by name or topic and exploring the use of voice commands for channel navigation. Overall, the discussion is focused on improving user experience and making channel navigation more intuitive and convenient." />
    <node id="1. Voice recognition technology: The team discussed the possibility of incorporating voice recognition technology in the remote control design, which could help reduce the number of buttons needed and make it more user-friendly. They were inspired by an example of using voice recognition technology in a coffee machine where users can say &quot;good morning&quot; and the machine will reply. This technology could also help improve the confusing interface by allowing users to use natural language commands to control the TV.&#10;2. Spinning wheel navigation: The user interface designer mentioned that some people use a spinning wheel as a navigation tool. This could be another way to reduce the number of buttons on the remote control while still providing easy navigation for users, potentially improving the confusing interface." />
    <node id="The transcript does not provide information on the specific price of the LCD display or the cost for incorporating voice recognition and a small vocabulary speech recognition system into the remote controls. These costs were not discussed in the meeting." />
    <node id="1. Based on the transcript, the industrial designer presented the possibility of using &quot;kinetic metal&quot; as a component for the remote control to generate power through user movement. The group agreed to consult their R&amp;D department to determine if this technology is feasible and available in the market. Therefore, it is recommended to proceed with consulting the R&amp;D department to check if kinetic metal technology is ready for market and can provide sufficient energy for a remote." />

Voice commands like &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;find&quot; can be used to make the remote beep or light up when misplaced, addressing a common user pain point.&#10;5. Security Measures: Incorporating a PIN code or password protection feature into the remote control can prevent unauthorized use by special users such as children and older adults. Reducing the number of buttons and incorporating voice recognition technology can also help simplify the user interface and reduce the risk of accidentally changing settings or accessing unintended features for multiple TV viewers.&#10;6. Cost-effectiveness: To keep costs down, it is essential to consider the feasibility and availability of kinetic metal technology in generating power through user movement for charging the remote when it is not in use. This can be explored further by consulting with the R&amp;D department.&#10;7. Charging Function: A potential option for charging the remote control is using &quot;kinetic metal&quot; technology to generate power through user movement. However, it is necessary to determine if this technology is feasible and available in the market before incorporating it into the design.&#10;8. Feature to Locate the Remote: The marketing team shared survey findings that 50% of people frequently lose their remote controls. Incorporating a vocal command, such as &quot;find,&quot; to make the remote control beep or light up when it is misplaced can help reduce frustration and make it easier for users to locate their remote controls.&#10;9. User Manual: Displaying usage instructions on the TV screen using a help button can assist users with any confusion or difficulties they may encounter while operating the remote control. This eliminates the need for an LCD display on the remote itself, reducing production costs and making it more user-friendly for all users.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the most essential features to include in the remote control design are simple navigation buttons, a help button with usage instructions displayed on the TV screen, voice recognition technology, security measures, and a feature to locate the remote using vocal commands. Keeping costs down can be achieved by exploring the feasibility of kinetic metal technology for charging the remote when it is not in use and eliminating the need for an LCD display on the remote itself.">

I have {gap} good .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we will talk about some specific details .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh {disfmarker} I'm participant two .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: This {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Components design .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique {vocalsound} to to store the energy .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;">

Based on the transcript, the industrial designer presented the possibility of using &quot;kinetic metal&quot; as a component for the remote control to generate power through user movement. The group agreed to consult their R&amp;D department to determine if this technology is feasible and available in the market. Therefore, it is recommended to proceed with consulting the R&amp;D department to check if kinetic metal technology is ready for market and can provide sufficient energy for a remote.">

    <node id="The critical moment prevented by Rivenoak was an immediate resort to violence, possibly resulting in the death of the noted hunter, who had insulted the warriors by refusing to acknowledge their efforts and disdaining to even wink when a rifle was discharged near his face.

Ondo these arms of mine, put a&#10;rifle into my hands, and I'll pin the thinnest warlock in your party&#10;to any tree you can show me, and this at a hundred yards--ay, or at two&#10;hundred if the objects can be seen, nineteen shots in twenty; or, for&#10;that matter twenty in twenty, if the piece is creditable and trusty!&quot;&#10;&#10;A low menacing murmur followed this cool taunt. The ire of the warriors&#10;kindled at listening to such a reproach from one who so far disdained&#10;their efforts as to refuse even to wink when a rifle was discharged as&#10;near his face as could be done without burning it. Rivenoak perceived&#10;that the moment was critical, and, still retaining his hope of adopting&#10;so noted a hunter into his tribe, the politic old chief interposed in&#10;time, probably to prevent an immediate resort to that portion of the&#10;torture which must necessarily have produced death through extreme&#10;bodily suffering, if in no other manner. Moving into the centre of&#10;the irritated group, he addressed them with his usual wily logic and&#10;plausible" />
    <node id="hes, place him face&#10;to face with this cawing bird; then let us see which is tired of life!&quot;&#10;&#10;Hist made a forward movement, as if to take a knife from a young man,&#10;and perform the office she had mentioned in person, but an aged warrior&#10;interposed, at a sign from Rivenoak. This chief watched all the girl did&#10;with distrust, for, even while speaking in her most boastful language,&#10;and in the steadiest manner, there was an air of uncertainty and&#10;expectation about her, that could not escape so close an observer. She&#10;acted well; but two or three of the old men were equally satisfied that&#10;it was merely acting. Her proposal to release Deerslayer, therefore, was&#10;rejected, and the disappointed Hist found herself driven back from the&#10;sapling, at the very moment she fancied herself about to be successful.&#10;At the same time, the circle, which had got to be crowded and confused,&#10;was enlarged, and brought once more into order. Rivenoak now announced&#10;the intention of the old men again to proceed, the delay having&#10;continued long enough, and leading to no result.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop Huron" />
    <node id=" the truest hands it was seldom that the captive&#10;escaped injury in these trials, and it often happened that death&#10;followed, even when the blow was not premeditated. In the particular&#10;case of our hero, Rivenoak and the older warriors were apprehensive that&#10;the example of the Panther's fate might prove a motive with some fiery&#10;spirit suddenly to sacrifice his conqueror, when the temptation of&#10;effecting it in precisely the same manner, and possibly with the&#10;identical weapon with which the warrior had fallen, offered. This&#10;circumstance of itself rendered the ordeal of the tomahawk doubly&#10;critical for the Deerslayer. It would seem, however, that all who now&#10;entered what we shall call the lists, were more disposed to exhibit&#10;their own dexterity, than to resent the deaths of their comrades. Each&#10;prepared himself for the trial with the feelings of rivalry, rather&#10;than with the desire for vengeance, and, for the first few minutes, the&#10;prisoner had little more connection with the result, than grew out of&#10;the interest that necessarily attached itself to a living target. The&#10;young men were eager, instead of being fierce, and Rivenoak thought he&#10;" />

He perceived that much agitation prevailed&#10;among the women in particular, while the warriors rested on their arms&#10;in a sort of dignified expectation. It was plain no alarm was excited,&#10;though it was not equally apparent that a friendly occurrence produced&#10;the delay. Rivenoak was evidently apprised of all, and by a gesture of&#10;his arm he appeared to direct the circle to remain unbroken, and for&#10;each person to await the issue in the situation he or she then occupied.&#10;It required but a minute or two to bring an explanation of this singular&#10;and mysterious pause, which was soon terminated by the appearance of&#10;Judith on the exterior of the line of bodies, and her ready admission&#10;within its circle.&#10;&#10;If Deerslayer was startled by this unexpected arrival, well knowing&#10;that the quick witted girl could claim none of that exemption from the&#10;penalties of captivity that was" />
    <node id=" Then he turned towards his&#10;enemies, as if ready again to face their torments. A short consultation&#10;had passed among the elders of the band, and by this time they also were&#10;prepared with their decision. The merciful purpose of Rivenoak had been&#10;much weakened by the artifice of Judith, which, failing of its real&#10;object, was likely to produce results the very opposite of those she had&#10;anticipated. This was natural; the feeling being aided by the resentment&#10;of an Indian who found how near he had been to becoming the dupe of&#10;an inexperienced girl. By this time, Judith's real character was fully&#10;understood, the wide spread reputation of her beauty contributing to the&#10;exposure. As for the unusual attire, it was confounded with the profound&#10;mystery of the animals with two tails, and for the moment lost its&#10;influence.&#10;&#10;When Rivenoak, therefore, faced the captive again, it was with an&#10;altered countenance. He had abandoned the wish of saving him, and was&#10;no longer disposed to retard the more serious part of the torture. This&#10;change of sentiment was, in effect, communicated to the young men,&#10;who were already eagerly engaged in" />
    <node id=" The offering of the two remaining elephants, and of the&#10;pistols already mentioned, one of which was all the worse for the recent&#10;accident, produced a lively sensation among the Hurons, generally,&#10;though Rivenoak received it coldly, notwithstanding the delight with&#10;which he had first discovered the probable existence of a creature with&#10;two tails. In a word, this cool and sagacious savage was not so easily&#10;imposed on as his followers, and with a sentiment of honor that half&#10;the civilized world would have deemed supererogatory, he declined&#10;the acceptance of a bribe that he felt no disposition to earn by a&#10;compliance with the donor's wishes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let my daughter keep her two-tailed hog, to eat when venison is&#10;scarce,&quot; he drily answered, &quot;and the little gun, which has two muzzles.&#10;The Hurons will kill deer when they are hungry, and they have long&#10;rifles to fight with. This hunter cannot quit my young men now; they&#10;wish to know if he is as stouthearted as he boasts himself to be.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That I deny, Huron--&quot; interrupted Deerslayer, with warmth--&quot;Yes, that" />
    <node id="The circle-making girl, known as Hist, gives several reasons for the Hurons to stop tormenting Deerslayer. First, she questions what he has done to deserve such treatment and who has given them the right to judge him. She also points out that Deerslayer refused to join in the attack on the Hurons, staying behind in the canoe instead.&#10;&#10;Rivenoak responds to Hist's request through an interpreter, addressing her as &quot;my daughter&quot; and dismissing her proposal to release Deerslayer. He tells her that they will proceed with their original plan, as the delay has gone on long enough with no result." />
    <node id=" the&#10;circle, gentle, feminine, even bashful in mien, as usual, but earnest&#10;in her words and countenance, speaking like one who knew herself to be&#10;sustained by the high authority of God.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why do you torment Deerslayer, redmen?&quot; she asked &quot;What has he done&#10;that you trifle with his life; who has given you the right to be his&#10;judges? Suppose one of your knives or tomahawks had hit him; what Indian&#10;among you all could cure the wound you would make. Besides, in harming&#10;Deerslayer, you injure your own friend; when father and Hurry Harry came&#10;after your scalps, he refused to be of the party, and staid in the canoe&#10;by himself. You are tormenting a good friend, in tormenting this young&#10;man!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Hurons listened with grave attention, and one among them, who&#10;understood English, translated what had been said into their native&#10;tongue. As soon as Rivenoak was made acquainted with the purport of her&#10;address he answered it in his own dialect; the interpreter conveying it&#10;to the girl in English.&#10;&#10;&quot;My daughter is" />
    <node id=" all waited for the&#10;visitor to explain her object, which to most of the spectators seemed as&#10;inexplicable as her appearance.&#10;&#10;&quot;Which of these warriors is the principal chief?&quot; demanded Judith of&#10;Deerslayer, as soon as she found it was expected that she should open&#10;the communications; &quot;my errand is too important to be delivered to any&#10;of inferior rank. First explain to the Hurons what I say; then give an&#10;answer to the question I have put.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer quietly complied, his auditors greedily listening to the&#10;interpretation of the first words that fell from so extraordinary a&#10;vision. The demand seemed perfectly in character for one who had every&#10;appearance of an exalted rank, herself. Rivenoak gave an appropriate&#10;reply, by presenting himself before his fair visitor in a way to leave&#10;no doubt that he was entitled to all the consideration he claimed.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can believe this, Huron,&quot; resumed Judith, enacting her assumed&#10;part with a steadiness and dignity that did credit to her powers of&#10;imitation, for she strove to impart to her manner the condescending&#10;courtesy she had once observed in the wife of a general officer," />
    <node id="&#10;the intention of the old men again to proceed, the delay having&#10;continued long enough, and leading to no result.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop Huron--stay chiefs!--&quot; exclaimed Judith, scarce knowing what she&#10;said, or why she interposed, unless to obtain time. &quot;For God's sake, a&#10;single minute longer--&quot;&#10;&#10;The words were cut short, by another and a still more extraordinary&#10;interruption. A young Indian came bounding through the Huron ranks,&#10;leaping into the very centre of the circle, in a way to denote the&#10;utmost confidence, or a temerity bordering on foolhardiness. Five or six&#10;sentinels were still watching the lake at different and distant points,&#10;and it was the first impression of Rivenoak that one of these had come&#10;in, with tidings of import. Still the movements of the stranger were so&#10;rapid, and his war dress, which scarcely left him more drapery than&#10;an antique statue, had so little distinguishing about it, that, at the&#10;first moment, it was impossible to ascertain whether he were friend or&#10;foe. Three leaps carried this warrior to the side of Deerslayer,&#10;whose withes were" />

Thomas Hutter's&#10;daughter--Thomas Hutter, whom you called the Muskrat; though he was no&#10;muskrat, but a man like yourselves--he lived in a house on the water,&#10;and that was enough for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;A smile of triumph gleamed on the hard wrinkled countenance of the&#10;chief, when he found how completely his appeal to the truth-loving&#10;Hetty had succeeded. As for Judith, herself, the moment her sister was&#10;questioned, she saw that all was lost; for no sign, or even intreaty&#10;could have induced the right feeling girl to utter a falsehood.&#10;To attempt to impose a daughter of the Muskrat on the savages as a&#10;princess, or a great lady, she knew would be idle, and she saw her bold&#10;and ingenious expedient for liberating the captive fail, through one of&#10;the simplest and most natural causes that could be imagined.

Of course this deliberate&#10;procedure was seen, and the hands of Hetty were arrested, ere she&#10;had more than liberated the upper portion of the captive's body, not&#10;including his arms below the elbows. This discovery at once pointed&#10;distrust towards Hist, and to Judith's surprise, when questioned on the&#10;subject, that spirited girl was not disposed to deny her agency in what&#10;had passed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should I not help the Deerslayer?&quot; the girl demanded, in the tones&#10;of a firm minded woman. &quot;He is the brother of a Delaware chief; my heart&#10;is all Delaware.

More than&#10;one hand was raised to strike this presumptuous intruder to the earth,&#10;but the chiefs prevented the blows, by reminding their irritated&#10;followers of the state of her mind. Hetty, herself, was insensible to&#10;the risk she ran, but, as soon as she had performed this bold act, she&#10;stood looking about her, in frowning resentment, as if to rebuke the&#10;crowd of attentive savages for their cruelty.&#10;&#10;&quot;God bless you, dearest sister, for that brave and ready act!&quot;&#10;murmured Judith, herself unnerved so much as to be incapable of&#10;exertion--&quot;Heaven, itself, has sent you on its holy errand.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twas well meant, Judith--&quot; rejoined the victim--&quot;'twas excellently&#10;meant, and 'twas timely; though it may prove ontimely in the ind!

A yell followed this second disappointment,&#10;but when the offender turned towards the circle, and presented the&#10;countenance of Hist, it was succeeded by a common exclamation of&#10;pleasure and surprise. For a minute, all thought of pursuing the&#10;business in hand was forgotten. Young and old crowded around the girl,&#10;in haste to demand an explanation of her sudden and unlooked-for return.&#10;It was at this critical instant that Hist spoke to Judith in a low&#10;voice, placed some small object unseen in her hand, and then turned to&#10;meet the salutations of the Huron girls, with whom she was personally&#10;a great favorite. Judith recovered her self possession, and acted&#10;promptly. The small, keen edged knife that Hist had given to the other,&#10;was passed by the latter into the hands of Hetty, as the safest and&#10;least suspected medium of transferring it to Deerslayer. But the feeble&#10;intellect of the last defeated the well-grounded hopes of all three.&#10;Instead of first cutting loose the hands of the victim, and then&#10;concealing the knife" />

'Twas&#10;well meant, but it might have been more marciful to let the flames act&#10;their part.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Cruel, heartless Hurons!&quot; exclaimed the still indignant Hetty--&quot;Would&#10;you burn a man and a Christian, as you would burn a log of wood! Do you&#10;never read your Bibles? Or do you think God will forget such things?&quot;&#10;&#10;A gesture from Rivenoak caused the scattered brands to be collected.&#10;Fresh wood was brought, even the women and children busying themselves&#10;eagerly, in the gathering of dried sticks. The flame was just kindling&#10;a second time, when an Indian female pushed through the circle, advanced&#10;to the heap, and with her foot dashed aside the lighted twigs in time to&#10;prevent the conflagration. A yell followed this second disappointment,&#10;but" />
    <node id="Based on Rivenoak's perspective, Judith is a woman of great beauty and unusual attire, which contributes to the mystery surrounding her. He acknowledges her exalted rank and is initially inclined to save Deerslayer due to her influence. However, when he realizes that Judith might not have the power she claims and may have deceived him, his attitude changes. He becomes more cautious and distrusting of her, seeing her as a potential threat rather than an ally. Despite her beauty and impressive demeanor, Rivenoak views Judith with suspicion due to her inability to prove her status and his cultural differences in understanding her appearance and behavior." />
    <node id="&quot;Now, Huron,&quot; she continued, &quot;listen to my words. Your eyes tell you&#10;that I am no common woman. I will not say I am queen of this country;&#10;she is afar off, in a distant land; but under our gracious monarchs,&#10;there are many degrees of rank; one of these I fill. What that rank&#10;is precisely, it is unnecessary for me to say, since you would not&#10;understand it. For that information you must trust your eyes. You see&#10;what I am; you must feel that in listening to my words, you listen to&#10;one who can be your friend, or your enemy, as you treat her.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was well uttered, with a due attention to manner and a steadiness&#10;of tone that was really surprising, considering all the circumstances&#10;of the case. It was well, though simply rendered into the Indian&#10;dialect too, and it was received with a respect and gravity that augured&#10;favourably for the girl's success. But Indian thought is not easily&#10;traced to its sources. Judith waited with anxiety to hear the answer,&#10;filled with hope even while she doubted.

    <node id=". Judith waited with anxiety to hear the answer,&#10;filled with hope even while she doubted. Rivenoak was a ready speaker,&#10;and he answered as promptly as comported with the notions of Indian&#10;decorum; that peculiar people seeming to think a short delay respectful,&#10;inasmuch as it manifests that the words already heard have been duly&#10;weighed.&#10;&#10;&quot;My daughter is handsomer than the wild roses of Ontario; her voice is&#10;pleasant to the ear as the song of the wren,&quot; answered the cautious and&#10;wily chief, who of all the band stood alone in not being fully imposed&#10;on by the magnificent and unusual appearance of Judith; but who&#10;distrusted even while he wondered: &quot;the humming bird is not much larger&#10;than the bee; yet, its feathers are as gay as the tail of the peacock.&#10;The Great Spirit sometimes puts very bright clothes on very little&#10;animals. Still He covers the Moose with coarse hair. These things are&#10;beyond the understanding of poor Indians, who can only comprehend&#10;what they see and hear.

    <node id="The confrontation between Briarthorn, Chingachgook, and the Serpent ended with Briarthorn being killed by the Serpent. This occurred when Chingachgook brought Deerslayer and Wah-ta-Wah to the Huron camp, where Briarthorn was attempting to gain favor with the tribe andHist, the woman they both loved. Briarthorn accused Chingachgook of being the enemy of the Hurons, but Hist defended him, revealing her true allegiance to the Delawares.&#10;&#10;The sudden halt of the Hurons was caused by the unexpected arrival of a British military force. The sound of their approach, described as &quot;regular and heavy, as if the earth were struck with beetles,&quot; startled the Hurons, who paused to listen and then saw the troops advancing through the forest. This force took the Hurons by surprise, as they were in a vulnerable position, surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth. The resulting scene was one of chaos, with the Hurons scrambling for their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets." />

At the&#10;next instant, a similar weapon glanced from the hand of the Serpent, and&#10;quivered in the recreant's heart. A minute had scarcely elapsed from the&#10;moment in which Chingachgook bounded into the circle, and that in which&#10;Briarthorn fell, like a log, dead in his tracks. The rapidity of events&#10;had prevented the Hurons from acting; but this catastrophe permitted no&#10;farther delay. A common exclamation followed, and the whole party was&#10;in motion. At this instant a sound unusual to the woods was heard, and&#10;every Huron, male and female, paused to listen, with ears erect and&#10;faces filled with expectation.

It was little likely&#10;that so small a force would assail so strong a band, and each man&#10;expected some extraordinary proposition to succeed so decisive a step.&#10;The stranger did not seem disposed to disappoint them; he prepared to&#10;speak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hurons,&quot; he said, &quot;this earth is very big. The Great Lakes are big,&#10;too; there is room beyond them for the Iroquois; there is room for the&#10;Delawares on this side. I am Chingachgook the Son of Uncas; the kinsman&#10;of Tamenund. This is my betrothed; that pale-face is my friend. My heart&#10;was heavy, when I missed him; I followed him to your camp, to see that&#10;no harm happened to him. All the Delaware girls are waiting for Wah;&#10;they wonder that she stays away so long. Come, let us say farewell, and&#10;go on our path.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hurons, this is your mortal enemy, the Great Serpent of them you hate!&quot;&#10;cried Briarthorn. &quot;If he escape, blood will be in your moccasin prints" />

Treachery&#10;is always liable to distrust, and though the recreant Briarthorn had&#10;endeavoured to serve the enemy well, his exertions and assiduities had&#10;gained for him little more than toleration. His wish to obtain Hist&#10;for a wife had first induced him to betray her, and his own people, but&#10;serious rivals to his first project had risen up among his new&#10;friends, weakening still more their sympathies with treason. In a word,&#10;Briarthorn had been barely permitted to remain in the Huron encampment,&#10;where he was as closely and as jealously watched as Hist, herself,&#10;seldom appearing before the chiefs, and sedulously keeping out of&#10;view" />

As for the delinquent,&#10;his blood boiled in his veins, and it was well for the pretty speaker&#10;that it was not in his power to execute the revenge he burned to inflict&#10;on her, in spite of his pretended love.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who wishes Briarthorn?&quot; he sternly asked--&quot;If this pale-face is tired&#10;of life, if afraid of Indian torments, speak, Rivenoak; I will send him&#10;after the warriors we have lost.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, chiefs--no, Rivenoak--&quot; eagerly interrupted Hist--&quot;Deerslayer fears&#10;nothing; least of all a crow!

They came upon the charge, the scarlet of the King's&#10;livery shining among the bright green foliage of the forest.&#10;&#10;The scene that followed is not easily described. It was one in which&#10;wild confusion, despair, and frenzied efforts, were so blended as to&#10;destroy the unity and distinctness of the action. A general yell burst&#10;from the enclosed Hurons; it was succeeded by the hearty cheers of&#10;England. Still not a musket or rifle was fired, though that steady,&#10;measured tramp continued, and the bayonet was seen gleaming in advance&#10;of a line that counted nearly sixty men. The Hurons were taken at&#10;a fearful disadvantage. On three sides was the water, while their&#10;formidable and trained foes cut them off from flight on the fourth.

    <node id="The critical moment that was averted by Rivenoak's intervention was an immediate resort to violence against the hunter, who had insulted the warriors by refusing to acknowledge their efforts and disdaining to even wink when a rifle was discharged near his face.

The&#10;young men were eager, instead of being fierce, and Rivenoak thought he&#10;still saw signs of being able to save the life of the captive when the&#10;vanity of the young men had been gratified; always admitting that it was&#10;not sacrificed to the delicate experiments that were about to be made.&#10;The first youth who presented himself for the trial was called The&#10;Raven, having as yet had no opportunity of obtaining a more warlike&#10;sobriquet. He was remarkable for high pretension, rather than for skill&#10;or exploits, and those who knew his character thought the captive&#10;in imminent danger when he took his stand, and poised the tomahawk.&#10;Nevertheless, the young man was good natured, and no thought was&#10;uppermost in his mind other than the desire to make a better cast than&#10;any of his fellows. Deerslayer got an inkling of this warrior's want&#10;of reputation by the injunctions that he had received from the seniors,&#10;who, indeed, would have objected to his appearing in the arena, at all,&#10;but for an influence derived from his father; an aged warrior of&#10;great merit, who was" />

Rivenoak hoped to adopt the hunter into his tribe and interposed to prevent the escalation of violence. He attempted to persuade the warriors not to harm the hunter by dismissing the proposal made by Hist, who questioned what the hunter had done to deserve such treatment and pointed out that he refused to join in the attack on the Hurons. Rivenoak addressed Hist as &quot;my daughter&quot; and told her that they would proceed with their original plan, as the delay had gone on long enough with no result." />
    <node id="The risks and consequences that Deerslayer anticipates from the precision and unpredictability of being targeted by a rifle in this torture method are primarily centered around the fact that the rifle's aim must be extremely accurate, as any variance could result in his death. The head is the target, and a difference of just an inch or two in the line of projection could mean life or death for Deerslayer. He knows that victims often end up being shot through the head by unskilled or overzealous hands, and that it's not uncommon for prisoners to be intentionally killed in moments of uncontrolled anger.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer feels some relief when he sees the chosen warriors preparing their rifles because he expects the end of his life and considers this method to be more honorable than others. He is familiar with the rifle, which reduces its terror for him, and has such a precise understanding of its range that he can predict within an inch where each bullet will strike. This leads him to express contempt for the marksmen when they miss their shots, unaware that the Hurons are deliberately aiming near his forehead in hopes of making him flinch.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly state that Deerslayer fears these consequences; rather, it implies that he has accepted his likely death and is trying to maintain his dignity and self-respect in the face of it." />
    <node id=" variance in the aim of this&#10;formidable weapon would prove fatal; since, the head being the target,&#10;or rather the point it was desired to graze without injuring, an inch or&#10;two of difference in the line of projection must at once determine the&#10;question of life or death.&#10;&#10;In the torture by the rifle there was none of the latitude permitted&#10;that appeared in the case of even Gessler's apple, a hair's breadth&#10;being, in fact, the utmost limits that an expert marksman would allow&#10;himself on an occasion like this. Victims were frequently shot through&#10;the head by too eager or unskilful hands, and it often occurred that,&#10;exasperated by the fortitude and taunts of the prisoner, death was&#10;dealt intentionally in a moment of ungovernable irritation. All this&#10;Deerslayer well knew, for it was in relating the traditions of such&#10;scenes, as well as of the battles and victories of their people, that&#10;the old men beguiled the long winter evenings in their cabins. He&#10;now fully expected the end of his career, and experienced a sort of&#10;melancholy pleasure in the idea that he was to fall by a weapon as much&#10;bel" />
    <node id=" such&#10;desire to receive so celebrated a hunter into his tribe, as a European&#10;Minister has to devise a new and available means of taxation, sought&#10;every plausible means of arresting the trial in season, for he well&#10;knew, if permitted to go far enough to arouse the more ferocious&#10;passions of the tormentors, it would be as easy to dam the waters of&#10;the great lakes of his own region, as to attempt to arrest them in their&#10;bloody career. He therefore called four or five of the best marksmen to&#10;him, and bid them put the captive to the proof of the rifle, while&#10;at the same time he cautioned them touching the necessity of their&#10;maintaining their own credit, by the closest attention to the manner of&#10;exhibiting their skill.&#10;&#10;When Deerslayer saw the chosen warriors step into the circle, with their&#10;arms prepared for service, he felt some such relief as the miserable&#10;sufferer, who has long endured the agonies of disease, feels at the&#10;certain approach of death.

As there was a double&#10;object in view, that of putting the constancy of the captive to the&#10;proof, and that of showing how steady were the hands of the marksmen&#10;under circumstances of excitement, the distance was small, and, in one&#10;sense, safe. But in diminishing the distance taken by the tormentors,&#10;the trial to the nerves of the captive was essentially increased. The&#10;face of Deerslayer, indeed, was just removed sufficiently from the ends&#10;of the guns to escape the effects of the flash, and his steady eye&#10;was enabled to look directly into their muzzles, as it might be, in&#10;anticipation of the fatal messenger that was to issue from each.

So&#10;exact was Deerslayer's estimation of the line of fire, that his pride of&#10;feeling finally got the better of his resignation, and when five or six&#10;had discharged their bullets into the tree, he could not refrain from&#10;expressing his contempt at their want of hand and eye.&#10;&#10;&quot;You may call this shooting, Mingos!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;but we've squaws&#10;among the Delawares, and I have known Dutch gals on the Mohawk, that&#10;could outdo your greatest indivours.

The&#10;cunning Hurons well knew this fact, and scarce one levelled his piece&#10;without first causing it to point as near as possible at the forehead&#10;of the prisoner, in the hope that his fortitude would fail him, and that&#10;the band would enjoy the triumph of seeing a victim quail under their&#10;ingenious cruelty. Nevertheless each of the competitors was still&#10;careful not to injure, the disgrace of striking prematurely being second&#10;only to that of failing altogether in attaining the object. Shot&#10;after shot was made; all the bullets coming in close proximity to the&#10;Deerslayer's head, without touching it. Still no one could detect even&#10;the twitching of a muscle on the part of the captive, or the slightest&#10;winking of an eye. This indomitable resolution, which so much exceeded&#10;everything of its kind that any present had before witnessed, might&#10;be referred to three distinct causes. The first was resignation to his&#10;fate, blended with natural steadiness of deportment; for our hero had&#10;calmly made up his mind that he must die, and preferred this mode to any&#10;" />

This ruse succeeded, and&#10;Deerslayer by rubbing his limbs, stamping his feet, and moving about,&#10;soon regained the circulation, recovering all his physical powers as&#10;effectually as if nothing had occurred to disturb them.&#10;&#10;It is seldom men think of death in the pride of their health and&#10;strength.

The significance of her name Judith as mentioned in the Bible is that it refers to a woman in the Old Testament who saved her people by beheading their enemy leader, Holofernes.

    <node id="The Hurons had a deep mistrust of Briarthorn due to several factors. First, they are generally wary of treachery, and Briarthorn's status as a recant Iroquois made them suspicious of his motives. Second, he had attempted to serve the enemy well but gained little sympathy from the Hurons. Third, Briarthorn's desire to marry Hist, a woman loved by both him and Chingachgook, created serious rivals among his new friends, further weakening their sympathies with him. Lastly, Briarthorn had been closely watched and was barely permitted to remain in the Huron encampment, where he was tolerated more than accepted. These factors contributed to the Hurons' deep mistrust of Briarthorn as he revealed his true allegiance before them." />

Deerslayer found it startling because he knew that the quick-witted girl could not claim exemption from the penalties of captivity, and he was surprised by her sudden appearance within the circle of Native American warriors.

After a suitable number of flourishes and gesticulations&#10;that promised much more than he could perform, the Raven let the&#10;tomahawk quit his hand. The weapon whirled through the air with the&#10;usual evolutions, cut a chip from the sapling to which the prisoner was&#10;bound within a few inches of his cheek, and stuck in a large oak that&#10;grew several yards behind him.

She knows that the Native American warriors are impressed by her appearance and demeanor, and she hopes to leverage this to persuade them to release Deerslayer.&#10;&#10;However, Judith's attempt to pass herself off as a princess is ultimately unsuccessful, as she is unable to prove her status and the Native American warriors become suspicious of her.

This focus on competition rather than vengeance leads to a slight increase in the chance that Deerslayer may escape injury during the ordeal.&#10;&#10;The Raven's attempt with the tomahawk turns out poorly, as he fails to hit the sapling near Deerslayer and instead embeds the weapon in a distant oak tree. This results in general mockery from other warriors. Meanwhile, Deerslayer maintains his composure throughout the trial, unaffected by the missed attempts and slight cuts on his body.&#10;&#10;The fact that Deerslayer escapes severe injury during the trial reveals his courage and ability to remain calm under pressure. The spectators' reactions of respect and admiration suggest they no longer harbor hostility towards him, except for Sumach and the Bounding Boy. Overall, the outcome highlights Deerslayer's bravery and the changing perspective of those watching, transitioning from potential enemies to respectful observers." />

Throw, or the Huron gals&#10;will laugh in your face.&quot;&#10;&#10;Although not intended to produce such an effect, the last words aroused&#10;the &quot;Bounding&quot; warrior to fury. The same nervous excitability which&#10;rendered him so active in his person, made it difficult to repress his&#10;feelings, and the words were scarcely past the lips of the speaker&#10;than the tomahawk left the hand of the Indian. Nor was it cast without&#10;ill-will, and a fierce determination to slay. Had the intention been&#10;less deadly, the danger might have been greater.

This was the first instance in which&#10;any other object than that of terrifying the prisoner, and of displaying&#10;skill had been manifested, and the Bounding Boy was immediately led from&#10;the arena, and was warmly rebuked for his intemperate haste, which had&#10;come so near defeating all the hopes of the band. To this irritable&#10;person succeeded several other young warriors, who not only hurled the&#10;tomahawk, but who cast the knife, a far more dangerous experiment, with&#10;reckless indifference; yet they always manifested a skill that prevented&#10;any injury to the captive. Several times Deerslayer was grazed, but in&#10;no instance did he receive what might be termed a wound. The unflinching&#10;firmness with which he faced his assailants, more especially in the sort&#10;of rally with which this trial terminated, excited a profound respect in&#10;the spectators, and when the chiefs announced that the prisoner had&#10;well withstood the trials of the knife and the tomahawk, there was not a&#10;single individual in the band who really felt any hostility towards&#10;him, with the exception of Sumach and the Bounding Boy.

    <node id="Based on the information provided, Rivenoak's merciful purpose towards the captive, Deerslayer, did not change. He never made a specific decision regarding Hetty's request about burying the fallen Huron warrior or showed an intention to save Deerslayer. Instead, Rivenoak intervened in a critical moment to prevent an immediate resort to violence and possible torture when the Hurons were considering taking action against Deerslayer.&#10;&#10;Rivenoak's initial inclination to save Deerslayer might have been due to Judith's influence, as he acknowledges her exalted rank, beauty, and unusual attire. However, his attitude changed when he realized that Judith might not have the power she claimed and may have deceived him. This led Rivenoak to view Judith with suspicion rather than seeing her as an ally.&#10;&#10;When Hist, the circle-making girl, questioned the Hurons' actions against Deerslayer and proposed releasing him, Rivenoak dismissed her proposal through an interpreter, stating that they would proceed with their original plan since the delay had gone on long enough with no result. This suggests that Rivenoak was never genuinely inclined to save Deerslayer but merely intervened to prevent unnecessary violence, and he consistently intended to follow through with the Hurons' initial plans for their captive." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Rivenoak thought highly of Judith's appearance, seeing her as a woman of great beauty and unusual attire, which contributed to the mystery surrounding her. He acknowledged her exalted rank, indicating that he believed she came from a position of high social standing. However, his perception of Judith changed when he realized that she might not have the power she claimed and may have deceived him. This led him to view her with suspicion rather than as an ally. The narrative does not provide any specific information about Rivenoak's beliefs about where Judith came from, aside from his acknowledgment of her exalted rank." />
    <node id="1. The deep sensation among the Hurons when Briarthorn revealed Deerslayer's identity was due to Briarthorn speaking in their own dialect with confidence, accusing Deerslayer of being a knave that the Hurons had been harboring. This revelation threatened to expose any existing internal divisions or conflicts within the tribe and potentially cause mistrust and violence among them.&#10;2. Briarthorn's efforts to serve the enemy gained him little trust or sympathy from his own people because he was initially motivated by a selfish desire to marry Hist, which led him to betray her and his own people. Furthermore, when he joined the Hurons, serious rivals emerged among his new friends, weakening any remaining sympathies for him. Consequently, the Hurons barely tolerated Briarthorn's presence in their encampment, closely watching him and allowing him little involvement in tribal affairs." />
    <node id="1. The Bounding Boy's relentless taunting with his tomahawk stems from his initial eagerness and desire to harm the captive, Deerslayer, as part of the warriors' competition. He wants to demonstrate his prowess by striking the tree as near to Deerslayer's head as possible without actually hitting him.&#10;2. Deerslayer responds to the Bounding Boy's behavior with unflinching firmness and composure, unaffected by the slight cuts on his body caused by the tomahawk. His calm demeanor and readiness for any outcome during the trial may have contributed to maintaining a safer environment for himself.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Bounding Boy's relentless taunting is motivated by his eagerness to demonstrate his skill and rivalry with other young warriors in the competition. Deerslayer's self-possession and readiness for any outcome help maintain his composure throughout the trial, potentially influencing its outcome in his favor." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide specific details about an incident where Deerslayer used his rifle to defend himself and others during a scene of confusion and dismay. The excerpt provided focuses on Deerslayer's encounter with the Huron warriors, during which he remains calm and composed while they perform various trials, including taunting him with a tomahawk. At one point, another warrior named The Raven attempts to embed his tomahawk in a sapling near Deerslayer but misses and is mocked by the others.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer escapes severe injury throughout these ordeals, demonstrating his courage and ability to remain calm under pressure. He even proposes a competition where he would use a rifle to showcase his superior marksmanship against the Huron warriors if they wish to prove their skills. The spectators' respectful reactions suggest that their hostility towards him has decreased, and some may now hold him in higher esteem due to his bravery.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that the narrative does not offer an instance where Deerslayer utilizes his rifle for self-defense or protection during this encounter with the Hurons. Therefore, without further information, it is impossible to provide a specific answer to this question based on the given text." />

Like a skulking fox, or like a&#10;leaping panther.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know yourself, Huron, how one of them fell. I saw it, and you all&#10;saw it, too. 'Twas too bloody to look at; but it was not Deerslayer's&#10;fault. Your warrior sought his life, and he defended himself. I don't&#10;know whether this good book says that it was right, but all men will&#10;do that. Come, if you want to know which of you can shoot best, give&#10;Deerslayer a rifle, and then you will find how much more expert he is&#10;than any of your warriors; yes, than all of them together!&quot;&#10;&#10;Could one have looked upon such a scene with indifference, he would&#10;have been amused at the gravity with which the savages listened to the&#10;translation of this unusual request.

    <node id="1. Judith's most striking effort to impress the Native American warriors was her choice of clothing. She abandoned her ordinary forest attire for a lavish brocade dress that had once greatly enhanced her appearance. This choice aimed to convey an image of wealth and importance, in order to deceive the savages into believing she was a woman of rank and influence.&#10;2. In addition to her choice of clothing, Judith paid meticulous attention to every detail of her attire, ensuring that everything was in harmony with female fashion of the time. Head, feet, arms, hands, bust, and drapery were all carefully arranged, demonstrating a level of sophistication that would be expected from someone of high social standing.&#10;3. By dressing and presenting herself in such a way, Judith hoped to impress the Native American warriors and leverage their admiration to her advantage. Her objective was to persuade them to release Deerslayer from captivity, and she believed that her appearance could help achieve this goal. However, despite her efforts, Judith's deception is ultimately unsuccessful, as she is unable to prove her status and the Native American warriors become suspicious of her." />
    <node id="layer was startled by this unexpected arrival, well knowing&#10;that the quick witted girl could claim none of that exemption from the&#10;penalties of captivity that was so cheerfully accorded to her feebler&#10;minded sister, he was equally astonished at the guise in which she came.&#10;All her ordinary forest attire, neat and becoming as this usually was,&#10;had been laid aside for the brocade that has been already mentioned,&#10;and which had once before wrought so great and magical an effect in&#10;her appearance. Nor was this all. Accustomed to see the ladies of the&#10;garrison in the formal, gala attire of the day, and familiar with&#10;the more critical niceties of these matters, the girl had managed to&#10;complete her dress in a way to leave nothing strikingly defective in its&#10;details, or even to betray an incongruity that would have been detected&#10;by one practised in the mysteries of the toilet. Head, feet, arms,&#10;hands, bust, and drapery, were all in harmony, as female attire was&#10;then deemed attractive and harmonious, and the end she aimed at, that of&#10;imposing on the uninstructed senses of the savages, by causing them to&#10;believe" />

The grim old warriors uttered&#10;their favorite exclamation &quot;hugh!&quot; The younger men were still more&#10;sensibly overcome, and even the women were not backward in letting&#10;open manifestations of pleasure escape them. It was seldom that these&#10;untutored children of the forest had ever seen any white female above&#10;the commonest sort, and, as to dress, never before had so much splendor&#10;shone before their eyes. The gayest uniforms of both French and English&#10;seemed dull compared with the lustre of the brocade, and while the rare&#10;personal beauty of the wearer added to the effect produced by its hues,&#10;the attire did not fail to adorn that beauty in a way which surpassed&#10;even the hopes of its wearer. Deerslayer himself was astounded, and this&#10;quite as much by the brilliant picture the girl presented, as at the&#10;indifference to consequences with which she had braved the danger of the&#10;step she had taken. Under such circumstances, all waited for the&#10;visitor to explain her object, which to most of the spectators seemed as&#10;inexplicable as her appearance.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="1. A more serious or threatening approach from the Bounding Boy: If the Bounding Boy were to change his strategy and aim the tomahawk with greater intent to harm Deerslayer, it might cause a reaction of fear in him. This could include throwing the tomahawk closer to Deerslayer's head or increasing the speed and force behind his throws.&#10;2. A loss of self-control: If the Bounding Boy becomes more emotionally invested in causing actual harm to Deerslayer, his demonstration may become effective in eliciting a response from Deerslayer. This could include an increase in anger, frustration, or anxiety on the part of the Bounding Boy, leading him to throw the tomahawk with less precision and more intent to harm.&#10;3. A change in Deerslayer's mental state: If Deerslayer begins to doubt his ability to remain unharmed during the trial or feels overwhelmed by the situation, he might be more likely to show a sign of fear. Factors that could contribute to this include fatigue, an increase in injuries, or the realization that the Bounding Boy is becoming increasingly aggressive.&#10;4. External factors affecting Deerslayer: If there are any unexpected events or distractions during the trial, such as commotion among the spectators or interference from animals, Deerslayer might become momentarily distracted and show a sign of fear.&#10;5. Psychological manipulation: The Bounding Boy could try to use psychological tactics to intimidate Deerslayer, such as verbal threats, insults, or other forms of harassment. This could cause Deerslayer to feel more vulnerable and increase the likelihood that he will show a sign of fear." />
    <node id="The principal chief of the Hurons that Judith inquired about is Rivenoak. Judith was able to maintain an air of dignity and steadiness while imitating the condescending courtesy of a general's wife by using her powers of imitation to create a demeanor fitting for someone of high rank, drawing from her observations of the wife of a general officer at a similar scene. She did this in order to establish credibility and assert authority as she delivered her important message to the Hurons." />

To you, then, I must make my communication.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let the Flower of the Woods speak,&quot; returned the old chief courteously,&#10;as soon as her address had been translated so that all might understand&#10;it--&quot;If her words are as pleasant as her looks, they will never quit my&#10;ears; I shall hear them long after the winter of Canada has killed all&#10;the flowers, and frozen all the speeches of summer.&quot;&#10;&#10;This admiration was grateful to one constituted like Judith, and&#10;contributed to aid her self-possession, quite as much as it fed her&#10;vanity. Smiling involuntarily, or in spite of her wish to seem reserved,&#10;she proceeded in her plot.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Huron,&quot; she continued, &quot;listen to my words.

This led him to view her with suspicion rather than as an ally.&#10;&#10;Regarding Judith's &quot;large wigwam,&quot; Rivenoak did not explicitly state where he believed it to be, aside from mentioning that the Hurons had not found it around the lake. He used this as an example of how the Great Spirit sometimes puts bright clothes on small animals but covers larger ones with coarse hair, indicating that he distrusted Judith's claims and saw her as deceptive. It is also worth noting that Rivenoak referred to Judith as &quot;my daughter&quot; in his response, which could be interpreted as a term of respect or endearment rather than a literal belief that they were related. Overall, while Rivenoak initially admired Judith's appearance and rank, he became skeptical of her claims and viewed her with suspicion due to her inability to prove her status and cultural differences in understanding her appearance and behavior." />
    <node id="1. The conflict between Chingachgook, Briarthorn, and the Great Serpent (Deerslayer) was that Briarthorn accused Chingachgook of being an enemy of the Hurons, while Hist defended him, revealing her true allegiance to the Delawares. Briarthorn then attempted to kill the Delaware chief but was swiftly killed by the Serpent. This series of events happened so quickly that the Hurons were unable to react immediately.&#10;&#10;2. The Hurons paused in their movement afterward due to the unexpected arrival of a British military force. The sound of their approach caused the Hurons to halt and listen, and they then saw the troops advancing through the forest. The Hurons were caught off-guard as they were surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth, resulting in chaos as they scrambled for their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets.&#10;&#10;The reason for the deep mistrust of Briarthorn among the Hurons was his status as a renegade Iroquois, his attempts to serve the enemy without gaining much sympathy from the Hurons, his desire to marry Hist creating rivals among his new friends, and his close surveillance and limited acceptance in the Huron encampment. Deerslayer's solo visit to the Hurons was to avoid causing trouble between their young men, as bringing his companions along could have led to conflict due to their natural inclination to defend each other. Briarthorn speaking in the Hurons' dialect with confidence, accusing Deerslayer of being a knave, threatened to expose internal divisions and potentially cause mistrust and violence among them." />
    <node id="1. The chaotic scene that ensued was described as one of wild confusion, despair, and frenzied efforts. When the Hurons heard the regular and heavy sound of the approaching British troops, they paused to listen and then saw the soldiers advancing through the forest. Surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth, the Hurons were at a fearful disadvantage. They scrambled to gather their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets. This resulted in chaos, with each warrior rushing for his arms and then seeking cover.&#10;2. Deerslayer, in the midst of this confusion, made sure Judith and Hist were hidden behind trees and looked for Hetty, who had been swept away in the crowd of Huron women. He then positioned himself on a flank of the retreating Hurons, hoping to escape through the water. When he found two of his recent tormentors in range, his rifle broke the silence of the terrific scene with a single discharge that brought down both at once. This drew a general fire from the Hurons, and the rifle and war cry of the Serpent were heard in the clamor. The trained men returned no answering volley, only the whoop and piece of Hurry were heard on their side, along with the short, prompt word of authority and that heavy tramp." />

In this scene of confusion and&#10;dismay, however, nothing could surpass the discretion and coolness of&#10;Deerslayer. His first care was to place Judith and Hist behind trees,&#10;and he looked for Hetty; but she had been hurried away in the crowd of&#10;Huron women. This effected, he threw himself on a flank of the retiring&#10;Hurons, who were inclining off towards the southern margin of the&#10;point, in the hope of escaping through the water. Deerslayer watched his&#10;opportunity, and finding two of his recent tormentors in a range, his&#10;rifle first broke the silence of the terrific scene. The bullet brought&#10;down both at one discharge. This drew a general fire from the Hurons,&#10;and the rifle and war cry of the Serpent were heard in the clamor.

She questions what he has done to deserve such treatment and who has given them the right to judge him. She also points out that Deerslayer refused to join in the attack on the Hurons, staying behind in the canoe instead.&#10;&#10;2. Rivenoak responds to Hist's request through an interpreter by dismissing her proposal to release Deerslayer. He tells her that they will proceed with their original plan, as the delay has gone on long enough with no result. The old men rejected Hist's proposal because they were not fully convinced by her performance and saw through her &quot;acting,&quot; sensing an air of uncertainty and expectation about her. Huron cultural differences and Hist's unconventional behavior and attire may have also contributed to their decision. Rivenoak, who initially intended to save Deerslayer due to Hist's influence, becomes more cautious when he realizes that she might not have the power she claims, further contributing to the rejection of her proposal.">

I am all Huron!&quot; As the last words were&#10;uttered, the traitor cast his knife at the naked breast of the Delaware.&#10;A quick movement of the arm, on the part of Hist, who stood near, turned&#10;aside the blow, the dangerous weapon burying its point in a pine.

A minute had scarcely elapsed from the&#10;moment in which Chingachgook bounded into the circle, and that in which&#10;Briarthorn fell, like a log, dead in his tracks. The rapidity of events&#10;had prevented the Hurons from acting; but this catastrophe permitted no&#10;farther delay. A common exclamation followed, and the whole party was&#10;in motion.

The conflict between Chingachgook, Briarthorn, and the Great Serpent (Deerslayer) was that Briarthorn accused Chingachgook of being an enemy of the Hurons, while Hist defended him, revealing her true allegiance to the Delawares. Briarthorn then attempted to kill the Delaware chief but was swiftly killed by the Serpent. This series of events happened so quickly that the Hurons were unable to react immediately.&#10;&#10;2. The Hurons paused in their movement afterward due to the unexpected arrival of a British military force. The sound of their approach caused the Hurons to halt and listen, and they then saw the troops advancing through the forest. The Hurons were caught off-guard as they were surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth, resulting in chaos as they scrambled for their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets.&#10;&#10;The reason for the deep mistrust of Briarthorn among the Hurons was his status as a renegade Iroquois, his attempts to serve the enemy without gaining much sympathy from the Hurons, his desire to marry Hist creating rivals among his new friends, and his close surveillance and limited acceptance in the Huron encampment. Deerslayer's solo visit to the Hurons was to avoid causing trouble between their young men, as bringing his companions along could have led to conflict due to their natural inclination to defend each other. Briarthorn speaking in the Hurons' dialect with confidence, accusing Deerslayer of being a knave, threatened to expose internal divisions and potentially cause mistrust and violence among them.">

This revelation threatened to expose any existing internal divisions or conflicts within the tribe and potentially cause mistrust and violence among them.&#10;2. Briarthorn's efforts to serve the enemy gained him little trust or sympathy from his own people because he was initially motivated by a selfish desire to marry Hist, which led him to betray her and his own people.

The Hurons paused in their movement afterward due to the unexpected arrival of a British military force. The sound of their approach caused the Hurons to halt and listen, and they then saw the troops advancing through the forest.

Deerslayer's solo visit to the Hurons was to avoid causing trouble between their young men, as bringing his companions along could have led to conflict due to their natural inclination to defend each other.

The Hurons were caught off-guard as they were surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth, resulting in chaos as they scrambled for their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets.&#10;&#10;The reason for the deep mistrust of Briarthorn among the Hurons was his status as a renegade Iroquois, his attempts to serve the enemy without gaining much sympathy from the Hurons, his desire to marry Hist creating rivals among his new friends, and his close surveillance and limited acceptance in the Huron encampment. Deerslayer's solo visit to the Hurons was to avoid causing trouble between their young men, as bringing his companions along could have led to conflict due to their natural inclination to defend each other. Briarthorn speaking in the Hurons' dialect with confidence, accusing Deerslayer of being a knave, threatened to expose internal divisions and potentially cause mistrust and violence among them.">

He wanted to meet with the Hurons without any confrontations or violence that might arise from his young men looking angrily at the Hurons, especially if they saw a pale-face bound for torture.&#10;2. Deerslayer believes that bringing his companions along could have led to conflict between the two groups of young men due to their natural inclination to defend and protect each other, which might have resulted in violence. This risk was heightened by the presence of the bound Deerslayer, who was a great hunter loved by many garrisons, increasing the likelihood of escalated tension and bloodshed." target="1. The chaotic scene that ensued was described as one of wild confusion, despair, and frenzied efforts. When the Hurons heard the regular and heavy sound of the approaching British troops, they paused to listen and then saw the soldiers advancing through the forest. Surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth, the Hurons were at a fearful disadvantage. They scrambled to gather their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets. This resulted in chaos, with each warrior rushing for his arms and then seeking cover.&#10;2. Deerslayer, in the midst of this confusion, made sure Judith and Hist were hidden behind trees and looked for Hetty, who had been swept away in the crowd of Huron women. He then positioned himself on a flank of the retreating Hurons, hoping to escape through the water. When he found two of his recent tormentors in range, his rifle broke the silence of the terrific scene with a single discharge that brought down both at once. This drew a general fire from the Hurons, and the rifle and war cry of the Serpent were heard in the clamor. The trained men returned no answering volley, only the whoop and piece of Hurry were heard on their side, along with the short, prompt word of authority and that heavy tramp.">

At one point, another warrior named The Raven attempts to embed his tomahawk in a sapling near Deerslayer but misses and is mocked by the others.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer escapes severe injury throughout these ordeals, demonstrating his courage and ability to remain calm under pressure. He even proposes a competition where he would use a rifle to showcase his superior marksmanship against the Huron warriors if they wish to prove their skills. The spectators' respectful reactions suggest that their hostility towards him has decreased, and some may now hold him in higher esteem due to his bravery.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that the narrative does not offer an instance where Deerslayer utilizes his rifle for self-defense or protection during this encounter with the Hurons.

Now, a whole hand is missing. Where are the fingers? Two have&#10;been cut off by this pale-face; my Hurons wish to see if he did this by&#10;means of a stout heart, or by treachery. Like a skulking fox, or like a&#10;leaping panther.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know yourself, Huron, how one of them fell. I saw it, and you all&#10;saw it, too. 'Twas too bloody to look at; but it was not Deerslayer's&#10;fault. Your warrior sought his life, and he defended himself. I don't&#10;know whether this good book says that it was right, but all men will&#10;do that. Come, if you want to know which of you can shoot best, give&#10;Deerslayer a rifle, and then you will find how much more expert he is&#10;than any of your warriors; yes, than all of them together!&quot;&#10;&#10;Could one have looked upon such a scene with indifference, he would&#10;have been amused at the gravity with which the savages listened to the&#10;translation of this unusual request.

Accustomed to see the ladies of the&#10;garrison in the formal, gala attire of the day, and familiar with&#10;the more critical niceties of these matters, the girl had managed to&#10;complete her dress in a way to leave nothing strikingly defective in its&#10;details, or even to betray an incongruity that would have been detected&#10;by one practised in the mysteries of the toilet. Head, feet, arms,&#10;hands, bust, and drapery, were all in harmony, as female attire was&#10;then deemed attractive and harmonious, and the end she aimed at, that of&#10;imposing on the uninstructed senses of the savages, by causing them to&#10;believe">

It was seldom that these&#10;untutored children of the forest had ever seen any white female above&#10;the commonest sort, and, as to dress, never before had so much splendor&#10;shone before their eyes. The gayest uniforms of both French and English&#10;seemed dull compared with the lustre of the brocade, and while the rare&#10;personal beauty of the wearer added to the effect produced by its hues,&#10;the attire did not fail to adorn that beauty in a way which surpassed&#10;even the hopes of its wearer. Deerslayer himself was astounded, and this&#10;quite as much by the brilliant picture the girl presented, as at the&#10;indifference to consequences with which she had braved the danger of the&#10;step she had taken.

He acknowledged her exalted rank, indicating that he believed she came from a position of high social standing. However, his perception of Judith changed when he realized that she might not have the power she claimed and may have deceived him. This led him to view her with suspicion rather than as an ally.&#10;&#10;Regarding Judith's &quot;large wigwam,&quot; Rivenoak did not explicitly state where he believed it to be, aside from mentioning that the Hurons had not found it around the lake. He used this as an example of how the Great Spirit sometimes puts bright clothes on small animals but covers larger ones with coarse hair, indicating that he distrusted Judith's claims and saw her as deceptive. It is also worth noting that Rivenoak referred to Judith as &quot;my daughter&quot; in his response, which could be interpreted as a term of respect or endearment rather than a literal belief that they were related. Overall, while Rivenoak initially admired Judith's appearance and rank, he became skeptical of her claims and viewed her with suspicion due to her inability to prove her status and cultural differences in understanding her appearance and behavior.">

The conflict between Chingachgook, Briarthorn, and the Great Serpent (Deerslayer) was that Briarthorn accused Chingachgook of being an enemy of the Hurons, while Hist defended him, revealing her true allegiance to the Delawares. Briarthorn then attempted to kill the Delaware chief but was swiftly killed by the Serpent. This series of events happened so quickly that the Hurons were unable to react immediately.&#10;&#10;2. The Hurons paused in their movement afterward due to the unexpected arrival of a British military force. The sound of their approach caused the Hurons to halt and listen, and they then saw the troops advancing through the forest. The Hurons were caught off-guard as they were surrounded by water on three sides and facing trained soldiers on the fourth, resulting in chaos as they scrambled for their weapons while the British advanced with measured steps and gleaming bayonets.&#10;&#10;The reason for the deep mistrust of Briarthorn among the Hurons was his status as a renegade Iroquois, his attempts to serve the enemy without gaining much sympathy from the Hurons, his desire to marry Hist creating rivals among his new friends, and his close surveillance and limited acceptance in the Huron encampment. Deerslayer's solo visit to the Hurons was to avoid causing trouble between their young men, as bringing his companions along could have led to conflict due to their natural inclination to defend each other. Briarthorn speaking in the Hurons' dialect with confidence, accusing Deerslayer of being a knave, threatened to expose internal divisions and potentially cause mistrust and violence among them." target="1.

He then positioned himself on a flank of the retreating Hurons, hoping to escape through the water. When he found two of his recent tormentors in range, his rifle broke the silence of the terrific scene with a single discharge that brought down both at once. This drew a general fire from the Hurons, and the rifle and war cry of the Serpent were heard in the clamor. The trained men returned no answering volley, only the whoop and piece of Hurry were heard on their side, along with the short, prompt word of authority and that heavy tramp.">

    <node id="In the narrative, Captain Dobbin has made arrangements for Amelia Sedley's safety in case of a military defeat by securing a retreat for her through her brother, Jos Sedley. Dobbin discusses this plan with Jos and is assured that Jos will &quot;stand by her&quot; and ensure her safe departure from Brussels if necessary. Dobbin believes he has set his mind at ease regarding Amelia's welfare.&#10;&#10;Dobbin's selfish desire to see Amelia before he leaves with his regiment goes unfulfilled because of the layout of Jos Sedley's apartment. The door to Jos's bedroom opens into a sitting-room used by the family party, and opposite this door is Amelia's chamber. When Dobbin enters the sitting-room, he finds that Amelia is already awake due to the bugle call sounding the alarm for the regiment's departure. As a result, any private meeting between Dobbin and Amelia before his departure becomes impossible.&#10;&#10;In summary, Captain Dobbin has made arrangements for Amelia Sedley's safety in case of a military defeat by ensuring her brother will look after her and make sure she is safe if the regiment has to retreat. However, Dobbin does not get to see Amelia before he leaves because she is already awake in her room when he enters the apartment." />
    <node id=", may I, that in case of extremity&#10;you will stand by her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; answered Mr. Jos, whose generosity in money&#10;matters Dobbin estimated quite correctly.&#10;&#10;&quot;And you'll see her safe out of Brussels in the event of a defeat?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A defeat! D---- it, sir, it's impossible.  Don't try and frighten ME,&quot;&#10;the hero cried from his bed; and Dobbin's mind was thus perfectly set&#10;at ease now that Jos had spoken out so resolutely respecting his&#10;conduct to his sister.  &quot;At least,&quot; thought the Captain, &quot;there will be&#10;a retreat secured for her in case the worst should ensue.&quot;&#10;&#10;If Captain Dobbin expected to get any personal comfort and satisfaction&#10;from having one more view of Amelia before the regiment marched away,&#10;his selfishness was punished just as such odious egotism deserved to&#10;be.  The door of Jos's bedroom opened into the sitting-room which was&#10;common to the family party, and opposite this door was that of Amelia's&#10;chamber.  The bugles had wakened everybody:  there was no use in&#10;concealment now" />
    <node id="the very dismallest of all the entertainments which Amelia had in her&#10;honeymoon.  She wrote the most piteous accounts of the feast home to&#10;her mamma:  how the Countess of Bareacres would not answer when spoken&#10;to; how Lady Blanche stared at her with her eye-glass; and what a rage&#10;Captain Dobbin was in at their behaviour; and how my lord, as they came&#10;away from the feast, asked to see the bill, and pronounced it a d----&#10;bad dinner, and d---- dear.  But though Amelia told all these stories,&#10;and wrote home regarding her guests' rudeness, and her own&#10;discomfiture, old Mrs. Sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless, and&#10;talked about Emmy's friend, the Countess of Bareacres, with such&#10;assiduity that the news how his son was entertaining peers and&#10;peeresses actually came to Osborne's ears in the City.&#10;&#10;Those who know the present Lieutenant-General Sir George Tufto, K.C.B.,&#10;and have seen him, as they may on most days in the season, padded and&#10;in stays, strutting down Pall Mall with a" />

With fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing&#10;at the year's end.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I don't think he could pay if he lost,&quot; Dobbin said; and his&#10;advice met with the success which advice usually commands.  Osborne and&#10;Crawley were repeatedly together now.  General Tufto dined abroad&#10;almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very&#10;close indeed to those of the General) which the aide-de-camp and his&#10;wife occupied in the hotel.&#10;&#10;Amelia's manners were such when she and George visited Crawley and his&#10;wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first&#10;quarrel; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident&#10;unwillingness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she&#10;comported herself towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did&#10;not say one single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon her,&#10;and Rebecca scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful" />
    <node id=" that he declines to&#10;receive any messages, letters, or communications from you on this or&#10;any other subject.&#10;&#10;&quot;A pretty way you have managed the affair,&quot; said George, looking&#10;savagely at William Dobbin.  &quot;Look there, Dobbin,&quot; and he flung over to&#10;the latter his parent's letter. &quot;A beggar, by Jove, and all in&#10;consequence of my d--d sentimentality.  Why couldn't we have waited? A&#10;ball might have done for me in the course of the war, and may still,&#10;and how will Emmy be bettered by being left a beggar's widow? It was&#10;all your doing.  You were never easy until you had got me married and&#10;ruined.  What the deuce am I to do with two thousand pounds?  Such a&#10;sum won't last two years.  I've lost a hundred and forty to Crawley at&#10;cards and billiards since I've been down here. A pretty manager of a&#10;man's matters YOU are, forsooth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There's no denying that the position is a hard one,&quot; Dobbin replied,&#10;after reading over the letter with a blank countenance" />
    <node id="thousand pounds an immense deal of money, George?&quot;&#10;&#10;George laughed at her naivete; and finally they went down to dinner,&#10;Amelia clinging to George's arm, still warbling the tune of &quot;Wapping&#10;Old Stairs,&quot; and more pleased and light of mind than she had been for&#10;some days past.&#10;&#10;Thus the repast, which at length came off, instead of being dismal, was&#10;an exceedingly brisk and merry one. The excitement of the campaign&#10;counteracted in George's mind the depression occasioned by the&#10;disinheriting letter. Dobbin still kept up his character of rattle.  He&#10;amused the company with accounts of the army in Belgium; where nothing&#10;but fetes and gaiety and fashion were going on.  Then, having a&#10;particular end in view, this dexterous captain proceeded to describe&#10;Mrs. Major O'Dowd packing her own and her Major's wardrobe, and how his&#10;best epaulets had been stowed into a tea canister, whilst her own&#10;famous yellow turban, with the bird of paradise wrapped in brown paper,&#10;was locked up in the Major's tin cocked-hat case, and wondered what&#10;effect it" />
    <node id="&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jos asked, rubbing his eyes.  The Captain did not&#10;in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the nightcap,&#10;about whom he professed to have such a tender interest. The hypocrite&#10;was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of&#10;George's apartments, striding about the room, upsetting the chairs,&#10;beating the tattoo, biting his nails, and showing other signs of great&#10;inward emotion.&#10;&#10;Jos had always had rather a mean opinion of the Captain, and now began&#10;to think his courage was somewhat equivocal.  &quot;What is it I can do for&#10;you, Dobbin?&quot; he said, in a sarcastic tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;I tell you what you can do,&quot; the Captain replied, coming up to the&#10;bed; &quot;we march in a quarter of an hour, Sedley, and neither George nor&#10;I may ever come back. Mind you, you are not to stir from this town&#10;until you ascertain how things go.  You are to stay here and watch over&#10;your sister, and comfort her, and see that no harm comes to her.  If&#10;anything happens to George, remember she has no one" />
    <node id="Mrs. Rebecca Crawley made a brilliant debut at the social gathering. The attendees were fascinated by the rumor that she had run away from a convent with Rawdon and was related to the Montmorency family. Rebecca's fluency in French, fine manners, and distinguished air contributed to the intrigue surrounding her presence, as she captivated many would-be partners despite being a newcomer among the great persons assembled." />

He&#10;called upon the ladies the next day; he rode by their side in the Park;&#10;he asked their party to a great dinner at a restaurateur's, and was&#10;quite wild with exultation when they agreed to come.  Old Bareacres,&#10;who had not much pride and a large appetite, would go for a dinner&#10;anywhere.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope there will be no women besides our own party,&quot; Lady Bareacres&#10;said, after reflecting upon the invitation which had been made, and&#10;accepted with too much precipitancy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gracious Heaven, Mamma--you don't suppose the man would bring his&#10;wife,&quot; shrieked Lady Blanche, who had been languishing in George's arms&#10;in the newly imported waltz for hours the night before.  &quot;The men are&#10;bearable, but their women--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Wife" />
    <node id=", where she was&#10;free to amuse herself as she liked.  Her thoughts were not of the&#10;pleasantest, and nobody except honest Dobbin came to disturb them.&#10;&#10;Whilst her appearance was an utter failure (as her husband felt with a&#10;sort of rage), Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's debut was, on the contrary, very&#10;brilliant.  She arrived very late.  Her face was radiant; her dress&#10;perfection.  In the midst of the great persons assembled, and the&#10;eye-glasses directed to her, Rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected&#10;as when she used to marshal Miss Pinkerton's little girls to church.&#10;Numbers of the men she knew already, and the dandies thronged round&#10;her.  As for the ladies, it was whispered among them that Rawdon had&#10;run away with her from out of a convent, and that she was a relation of&#10;the Montmorency family.  She spoke French so perfectly that there might&#10;be some truth in this report, and it was agreed that her manners were&#10;fine, and her air distingue.  Fifty would-be partners thronged round&#10;her at once, and pressed to" />

She favoured her friends with these and other opinions&#10;in a very loud tone of voice, and tossed about a great clattering fan&#10;she sported, with the most splendid complacency.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who is that wonderful woman with Amelia, Rawdon, love?&quot; said a lady in&#10;an opposite box (who, almost always civil to her husband in private,&#10;was more fond than ever of him in company).&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't you see that creature with a yellow thing in her turban, and a&#10;red satin gown, and a great watch?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Near the pretty little woman in white?&quot; asked a middle-aged gentleman&#10;seated by the querist's side, with orders in his button, and several&#10;under-waistcoats, and a great, choky, white stock.&#10;&#10;&quot;That pretty woman in white is Amelia, General:  you are remarking all&#10;" />
    <node id=" hero whom she had&#10;worshipped?  It requires many, many years--and a man must be very bad&#10;indeed--before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a&#10;confession.  Then Rebecca's twinkling green eyes and baleful smile&#10;lighted upon her, and filled her with dismay.  And so she sate for&#10;awhile indulging in her usual mood of selfish brooding, in that very&#10;listless melancholy attitude in which the honest maid-servant had found&#10;her, on the day when she brought up the letter in which George renewed&#10;his offer of marriage.&#10;&#10;She looked at the little white bed, which had been hers a few days&#10;before, and thought she would like to sleep in it that night, and wake,&#10;as formerly, with her mother smiling over her in the morning: Then she&#10;thought with terror of the great funereal damask pavilion in the vast&#10;and dingy state bedroom, which was awaiting her at the grand hotel in&#10;Cavendish Square.  Dear little white bed! how many a long night had she&#10;wept on its pillow! How she had despaired and hoped to die there;" />
    <node id=" was becoming quite a domestic character.  And a&#10;jaunt or a junket with HIM!  Was it not enough to set this little heart&#10;beating with joy?  Her letters home to her mother were filled with&#10;delight and gratitude at this season.  Her husband bade her buy laces,&#10;millinery, jewels, and gimcracks of all sorts.  Oh, he was the kindest,&#10;best, and most generous of men!&#10;&#10;The sight of the very great company of lords and ladies and fashionable&#10;persons who thronged the town, and appeared in every public place,&#10;filled George's truly British soul with intense delight.  They flung&#10;off that happy frigidity and insolence of demeanour which occasionally&#10;characterises the great at home, and appearing in numberless public&#10;places, condescended to mingle with the rest of the company whom they&#10;met there.  One night at a party given by the general of the division&#10;to which George's regiment belonged, he had the honour of dancing with&#10;Lady Blanche Thistlewood, Lord Bareacres' daughter; he bustled for ices&#10;and refreshments for the two noble ladies; he pushed and squeezed" />

Oh, how he wished that night's work undone!  and that&#10;with a clear conscience at least he might say farewell to the tender&#10;and guileless being by whose love he had set such little store!&#10;&#10;He thought over his brief married life.  In those few weeks he had&#10;frightfully dissipated his little capital.  How wild and reckless he&#10;had been!  Should any mischance befall him:  what was then left for&#10;her?  How unworthy he was of her.  Why had he married her?  He was not&#10;fit for marriage.  Why had he disobeyed his father, who had been always&#10;so generous to him?  Hope, remorse, ambition, tenderness, and selfish&#10;regret filled his heart.  He sate down and wrote to his father,&#10;remembering what he had said once before, when he was engaged to fight&#10;a duel. Dawn faintly streaked the sky as he closed this farewell&#10;letter.  He sealed it, and kissed the superscription. He thought how he&#10;had deserted that generous father, and of the thousand kindnesses which&#10;the stern old man had done him.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="During Rebecca's morning walk, she had an hour-long chat with Amelia, who had recovered from her illness. After their conversation, Rebecca was confident that she would be able to report the details of their conversation to Miss Crawley very soon. Upon returning to the inn, Rebecca took a tender farewell of Amelia and ate some prawns with a good appetite while explaining to Rawdon what had occurred during her walk with Briggs. She shared her high hopes with him, making him share her optimism as well.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that Rebecca's conversation with Amelia revolved around the latter's father's misfortunes, and Rebecca made a charitable comment about it. Later, she also downplayed Amelia's coolness towards her and attributed it to Emmy becoming prouder since her father's financial setbacks or perhaps due to Rebecca living with Rawdon and the General. Rebecca then defended their living arrangements and expressed gratitude towards Amelia while subtly criticizing her." />
    <node id="; and Rebecca, after an&#10;hour's chat with her recovered friend, left her with the most tender&#10;demonstrations of regard, and quite assured that the conversation they&#10;had had together would be reported to Miss Crawley before many hours&#10;were over.&#10;&#10;This interview ended, it became full time for Rebecca to return to her&#10;inn, where all the party of the previous day were assembled at a&#10;farewell breakfast.  Rebecca took such a tender leave of Amelia as&#10;became two women who loved each other as sisters; and having used her&#10;handkerchief plentifully, and hung on her friend's neck as if they were&#10;parting for ever, and waved the handkerchief (which was quite dry, by&#10;the way) out of window, as the carriage drove off, she came back to the&#10;breakfast table, and ate some prawns with a good deal of appetite,&#10;considering her emotion; and while she was munching these delicacies,&#10;explained to Rawdon what had occurred in her morning walk between&#10;herself and Briggs.  Her hopes were very high:  she made her husband&#10;share them.  She generally succeeded in making her husband share all&#10;her opinions," />
    <node id=" one single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon her,&#10;and Rebecca scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful&#10;and awkward on the second visit which she paid to Mrs. Rawdon, than on&#10;her first call.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was doubly affectionate, of course, and would not take notice,&#10;in the least, of her friend's coolness.  &quot;I think Emmy has become&#10;prouder since her father's name was in the--since Mr. Sedley's&#10;MISFORTUNES,&quot; Rebecca said, softening the phrase charitably for&#10;George's ear.&#10;&#10;&quot;Upon my word, I thought when we were at Brighton she was doing me the&#10;honour to be jealous of me; and now I suppose she is scandalised&#10;because Rawdon, and I, and the General live together.  Why, my dear&#10;creature, how could we, with our means, live at all, but for a friend&#10;to share expenses?  And do you suppose that Rawdon is not big enough to&#10;take care of my honour?  But I'm very much obliged to Emmy, very,&quot; Mrs.&#10;Rawdon said.&#10;&#10;" />

    <node id="--hey, Becky?&quot;&#10;&#10;In consequence of the repeated visits of the aides-de-camp of the&#10;Sheriff of Middlesex, Rawdon and his wife did not go back to their&#10;lodgings at Brompton, but put up at an inn.  Early the next morning,&#10;Rebecca had an opportunity of seeing them as she skirted that suburb on&#10;her road to old Mrs. Sedley's house at Fulham, whither she went to look&#10;for her dear Amelia and her Brighton friends.  They were all off to&#10;Chatham, thence to Harwich, to take shipping for Belgium with the&#10;regiment--kind old Mrs. Sedley very much depressed and tearful,&#10;solitary.  Returning from this visit, Rebecca found her husband, who&#10;had been off to Gray's Inn, and learnt his fate.  He came back furious.&#10;&#10;&quot;By Jove, Becky,&quot; says he, &quot;she's only given me twenty pound!&quot;&#10;&#10;Though it told against themselves, the joke was too good, and Becky&#10;burst out laughing at Rawdon's discomfiture.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Between London and Chatham&#10;&#10;On quitting Brighton, our friend George, as became a" />

And it effected&#10;the purpose for which the old lady had caused it to be written, by&#10;making Rawdon very eager to get to London.&#10;&#10;Out of Jos's losings and George Osborne's bank-notes, he paid his bill&#10;at the inn, the landlord whereof does not probably know to this day how&#10;doubtfully his account once stood.  For, as a general sends his baggage&#10;to the rear before an action, Rebecca had wisely packed up all their&#10;chief valuables and sent them off under care of George's servant, who&#10;went in charge of the trunks on the coach back to London.  Rawdon and&#10;his wife returned by the same conveyance next day.&#10;&#10;&quot;I should have liked to see the old girl before we went,&quot; Rawdon said.&#10;&quot;She looks so cut up and altered that I'm sure she can't last long.  I&#10;wonder what sort of a cheque I shall have at Waxy's.

    <node id="George Osborne and Rawdon Crawley made an arrangement for Crawley to receive a sum of money from Osborne before their departure for London. This arrangement was not entirely convenient for Osborne, but he still gave Crawley a considerable present in bank-notes and a bill on his agents at a week's date for the remaining sum.&#10;&#10;Regarding Amelia's reaction to their imminent departure, she had already packed her little trunks with great alacrity in the morning, while Osborne lay in bed deploring that she had not a maid to help her. She was glad to perform this office for herself, but a dim uneasy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already. Despite their tender farewell kiss, Amelia's jealousy (among other virtues of her sex) began to surface as they parted." />

And, as she was&#10;by no means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy, she&#10;disliked him the more for his adoration of Amelia.  Nevertheless, she&#10;was very respectful and cordial in her manner towards him.  A friend to&#10;the Osbornes! a friend to her dearest benefactors!  She vowed she&#10;should always love him sincerely: she remembered him quite well on the&#10;Vauxhall night, as she told Amelia archly, and she made a little fun of&#10;him when the two ladies went to dress for dinner.  Rawdon Crawley paid&#10;scarcely any attention to Dobbin, looking upon him as a good-natured&#10;nincompoop and under-bred City man.  Jos patronised him with much&#10;dignity.&#10;&#10;When George and Dobbin were alone in the latter's room, to which George&#10;had followed him, Dobbin took from his desk the letter which he had&#10;been charged by Mr. Osborne to deliver to his son.  &quot;It's not in my&#10;father's handwriting,&quot; said George, looking rather alarmed; nor" />

Then she resumed her&#10;conversation with General Tufto, who asked &quot;who the fat officer was in&#10;the gold-laced cap?&quot; on which Becky replied, &quot;that he was an officer in&#10;the East Indian service.&quot; But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of&#10;his company, and came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said&#10;to Jos, &quot;Well, old boy, how are you?&quot; and stared in Mrs. O'Dowd's face&#10;and at the black cock's feathers until she began to think she had made&#10;a conquest of him.&#10;&#10;George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately with&#10;Dobbin, and they touched their caps to the august personages, among&#10;whom Osborne at once perceived Mrs. Crawley.  He was delighted to see&#10;Rawdon leaning over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and&#10;met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding&#10;warmth.  The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest&#10;" />

Jos, I think, would&#10;have preferred staying until Rawdon Crawley quitted Brighton, but&#10;Dobbin and George overruled him, and he agreed to carry the party to&#10;town, and ordered four horses, as became his dignity.  With these they&#10;set off in state, after breakfast, the next day.

She was only too glad, however, to perform this office for&#10;herself.  A dim uneasy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already;&#10;and although they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we&#10;know what jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other&#10;virtues of her sex.&#10;&#10;Besides these characters who are coming and going away, we must&#10;remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;&#10;Miss Crawley, namely, and the suite in attendance upon her.  Now,&#10;although Rebecca and her husband were but at a few stones' throw of the&#10;lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawley occupied, the old lady's door&#10;remained as pitilessly closed to them as it had been heretofore in&#10;London.  As long as she remained by the side of her sister-in-law,&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley took care that her beloved Matilda should not be&#10;agitated by a meeting with her nephew." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Amelia is warmly welcomed by the Major's family and the mess-room society, which is marked by unity, camaraderie, and a lack of quarreling. The Major's wife, Mrs. O'Dowd, plays a significant role in this welcoming committee. She is described as having a vivacious personality and being accepting of Amelia, despite George's previous comments about her.&#10;&#10;Mrs. O'Dowd refers to the mess-room society as one where there is no bickering or small talk, and where everyone loves each other. This is in contrast to other regiments, where such behavior might be more common. The mess-room society is depicted as being a close-knit group, with strong bonds between its members.&#10;&#10;One notable characteristic of their relationships is the use of nicknames or aliases. For instance, Mrs. O'Dowd is also called Peggy, and Ensign Simple is referred to as &quot;Simple of ours.&quot; This use of nicknames adds a familiar and informal tone to their interactions, further emphasizing the closeness of their relationships.&#10;&#10;Another characteristic of their relationships is the way they look out for each other. For example, when the regiment is ordered to Ghent or Brussels, Mrs. O'Dowd quickly notices Amelia's distress and reassures her by saying that she will be an addition to their family. Additionally, when Captain Dobbin expresses concern about Amelia's safety in the event of a defeat, Jos confidently assures him that he will see her safely out of Brussels.&#10;&#10;Overall, the mess-room society is depicted as being a supportive and close-knit group, with strong bonds between its members. The use of nicknames and the way they look out for each other are notable characteristics of their relationships." />

    <node id="The woman's reluctance to admit that the hero she once worshipped is now very bad stems from her pride and vanity. According to the narrative, &quot;it requires many, many years--and a man must be very bad indeed--before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession.&quot; This suggests that the woman has been deeply invested in the idea of her hero as a perfect figure, and acknowledging his faults would mean admitting that her judgment or idealization was misguided.&#10;&#10;As she contemplates spending the night in her old bedroom versus the grand hotel she must now stay in, she experiences a range of emotions. She feels dismay at the thought of sharing a room with Rebecca, but also nostalgia and longing for her past life. The bed she used to sleep in is associated with many nights of weeping and despair, as well as parental affection that she may have taken for granted. Now that she has married and entered a new phase of life, she feels a sense of shame when looking back at her former self, who was so focused on one desire (marrying her hero) that she neglected other aspects of her life. The grand hotel, in contrast, represents her new social standing as a married woman, but it also fills her with terror, highlighting the pressure and expectations that come with her new role." />
    <node id="  What a gulf lay between her and that past life. She could&#10;look back to it from her present standing-place, and contemplate,&#10;almost as another being, the young unmarried girl absorbed in her love,&#10;having no eyes but for one special object, receiving parental affection&#10;if not ungratefully, at least indifferently, and as if it were her&#10;due--her whole heart and thoughts bent on the accomplishment of one&#10;desire.  The review of those days, so lately gone yet so far away,&#10;touched her with shame; and the aspect of the kind parents filled her&#10;with tender remorse. Was the prize gained--the heaven of life--and the&#10;winner still doubtful and unsatisfied?  As his hero and heroine pass&#10;the matrimonial barrier, the novelist generally drops the curtain, as&#10;if the drama were over then:  the doubts and struggles of life ended:&#10;as if, once landed in the marriage country, all were green and pleasant&#10;there:  and wife and husband had nothing to do but to link each other's&#10;arms together, and wander gently downwards towards old age in happy and&#10;perfect fruition.

But&#10;beyond this neither of the ladies rallied.  Amelia was overpowered by&#10;the flash and the dazzle and the fashionable talk of her worldly rival.&#10;Even the O'Dowd was silent and subdued after Becky's brilliant&#10;apparition, and scarcely said a word more about Glenmalony all the&#10;evening.&#10;&#10;&quot;When do you intend to give up play, George, as you have promised me,&#10;any time these hundred years?&quot; Dobbin said to his friend a few days&#10;after the night at the Opera.  &quot;When do you intend to give up&#10;sermonising?&quot; was the other's reply.  &quot;What the deuce, man, are you&#10;alarmed about?

But his luck at play even did not cure him of&#10;his restlessness, and he started up after awhile, pocketing his&#10;winnings, and went to a buffet, where he drank off many bumpers of wine.&#10;&#10;Here, as he was rattling away to the people around, laughing loudly and&#10;wild with spirits, Dobbin found him. He had been to the card-tables to&#10;look there for his friend.  Dobbin looked as pale and grave as his&#10;comrade was flushed and jovial.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hullo, Dob!  Come and drink, old Dob!  The Duke's wine is famous. Give&#10;me some more, you sir&quot;; and he held out a trembling glass for the&#10;liquor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come out, George,&quot; said Dobbin, still gravely; &quot;don't drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Drink!  there's nothing" />

    <node id="In the narrative, Amelia and her mother, Mrs. Sedley, are preparing for Mrs. George Osborne's (Amelia's mother-in-law) upcoming foreign tour. They spent their day shopping together, traveling around in a carriage from one store to another, visiting milliners, linen-drapers, and other shops. Both ladies were engaged in purchasing items required for Mrs. George Osborne's fashionable outfit for the tour, with obsequious shopmen and polite owners accompanying them.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley was sincerely happy while shopping, as it reminded her of her better days before their misfortunes. Amelia also joined her mother in this pleasure, buying herself some new things as well, demonstrating a great deal of taste and elegant discernment.&#10;&#10;The narrative highlights the bond between the two women, with Mrs. Sedley expressing her affection by preparing festive refreshments for Amelia's arrival after her marriage, such as muffins and orange marmalade spread out in a little cut-glass saucer. Overall, their day is filled with shopping, companionship, and preparations to bid farewell to Mrs. George Osborne as she embarks on her journey." />

George was too busy gloating over&#10;the money (for he had never had such a sum before), to mark the&#10;countenance or flight of the cadaverous suitor of his sister.&#10;&#10;Fred Bullock told old Osborne of his son's appearance and conduct. &quot;He&#10;came in as bold as brass,&quot; said Frederick.  &quot;He has drawn out every&#10;shilling.  How long will a few hundred pounds last such a chap as&#10;that?&quot; Osborne swore with a great oath that he little cared when or how&#10;soon he spent it.  Fred dined every day in Russell Square now.  But&#10;altogether, George was highly pleased with his day's business.  All his&#10;own baggage and outfit was put into a state of speedy preparation, and&#10;he paid Amelia's purchases with cheques on his agents, and with the&#10;splendour of a lord.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In Which Amelia Joins Her Regiment&#10;&#10;When Jos's fine carriage drove up to the inn door at Chatham, the first&#10;face which Amelia recognized was the friendly countenance of Captain&#10;Dobbin, who had been pacing the street for an" />

George's servant was packing in this room:  Osborne&#10;coming in and out of the contiguous bedroom, flinging to the man such&#10;articles as he thought fit to carry on the campaign. And presently&#10;Dobbin had the opportunity which his heart coveted, and he got sight of&#10;Amelia's face once more.  But what a face it was!  So white, so wild&#10;and despair-stricken, that the remembrance of it haunted him afterwards&#10;like a crime, and the sight smote him with inexpressible pangs of&#10;longing and pity.&#10;&#10;She was wrapped in a white morning dress, her hair falling on her&#10;shoulders, and her large eyes fixed and without light.  By way of&#10;helping on the preparations for the departure, and showing that she too&#10;could be useful at a moment so critical, this poor soul had taken up a&#10;sash of George's from the drawers whereon it lay, and followed him to&#10;and fro with the sash in her hand, looking on mutely as his packing&#10;" />

Having put the&#10;Collector into the hands of his servant, Dobbin loitered about, smoking&#10;his cigar before the inn door. George had meanwhile very carefully&#10;shawled his wife, and brought her away from Mrs. O'Dowd's after a&#10;general handshaking from the young officers, who accompanied her to the&#10;fly, and cheered that vehicle as it drove off.  So Amelia gave Dobbin&#10;her little hand as she got out of the carriage, and rebuked him&#10;smilingly for not having taken any notice of her all night.&#10;&#10;The Captain continued that deleterious amusement of smoking, long after&#10;the inn and the street were gone to bed.  He watched the lights vanish&#10;from George's sitting-room windows, and shine out in the bedroom close&#10;at hand.

What cared she so long as her&#10;husband was near her?  Thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was&#10;juggled away.  Though war and danger were in store, war and danger&#10;might not befall for months to come.  There was a respite at any rate,&#10;which made the timid little Amelia almost as happy as a full reprieve&#10;would have done, and which even Dobbin owned in his heart was very&#10;welcome.  For, to be permitted to see her was now the greatest&#10;privilege and hope of his life, and he thought with himself secretly&#10;how he would watch" />
    <node id="based on the description provided in the narrative, the once light-haired and bald Sir George Tufto underwent a significant physical transformation in his later years. He suddenly grew thick, curly, brown hair and black eyebrows, as well as deep purple whiskers. This change occurred when he was around seventy years old and his hair, which was very scarce and white at the time, became thick and brown.&#10;&#10;These dramatic changes in Sir George Tufto's appearance led to rumors about the authenticity of his hair, with some people speculating that his chest is &quot;all wool&quot; and that his hair is a wig because it never grows. These rumors are further fueled by the fact that Sir George Tufto's grandpapa reportedly lost his hair after an encounter with Mademoiselle de Jaisey in the green-room, leading some to wonder if there is a genetic predisposition for hair loss in the family. However, it is important to note that these rumors are not confirmed and are simply speculation based on Sir George Tufto's dramatic change in appearance." />

As for &quot;tickers,&quot; as poor Rawdon called watches, her&#10;apartments were alive with their clicking. For, happening to mention&#10;one night that hers, which Rawdon had given to her, was of English&#10;workmanship, and went ill, on the very next morning there came to her a&#10;little bijou marked Leroy, with a chain and cover charmingly set with&#10;turquoises, and another signed Brequet, which was covered with pearls,&#10;and yet scarcely bigger than a half-crown.  General Tufto had bought&#10;one, and Captain Osborne had gallantly presented the other.

George pooh-poohed the wine and bullied the waiters, while Jos gobbled up the turtle with satisfaction. Dobbin helped him to it, as Amelia appeared to be unfamiliar with the meal before her.&#10;&#10;As for Amelia's role in these celebrations, she seemed overwhelmed by the grandeur of the event and lacked confidence in her new position as a married woman and hostess. When George left her on her own at the famous ball he had brought her to, she was surrounded by strangers and felt excluded from the social scene.

The old lady has not forgiven Rawdon for making such an imprudent marriage, and Rebecca fears that she will never be accepted by her aunt-in-law. Despite this, Rebecca remains hopeful and believes that Miss Crawley may relent in the future. However, the couple's isolation is also due to their own circumstances, including financial difficulties and legal issues, which have forced them to flee from London to Brighton. They are constantly on the run from Mr. Moses, the sheriff's officer, who is watching their lodgings, and they are relying on Rawdon's acquaintances Jos and Osborne for financial support. Overall, the cold indifference of Matilda Crawley's party towards Rawdon and Rebecca is a result of both personal animosity and circumstantial factors that have pushed them to the fringes of society." />

Meanwhile the gallant&#10;Jos had agreed to escort his sister and the Major's wife, the bulk of&#10;whose goods and chattels, including the famous bird of paradise and&#10;turban, were with the regimental baggage: so that our two heroines&#10;drove pretty much unencumbered to Ramsgate, where there were plenty of&#10;packets plying, in one of which they had a speedy passage to Ostend.&#10;&#10;That period of Jos's life which" />

So prodigiously good was the eating and&#10;drinking on board these sluggish but most comfortable vessels, that&#10;there are legends extant of an English traveller, who, coming to&#10;Belgium for a week, and travelling in one of these boats, was so&#10;delighted with the fare there that he went backwards and forwards from&#10;Ghent to Bruges perpetually until the railroads were invented, when he&#10;drowned himself on the last trip of the passage-boat.  Jos's death was&#10;not to be of this sort, but his comfort was exceeding, and Mrs. O'Dowd&#10;insisted that he only wanted her sister Glorvina to make his happiness&#10;complete.  He sate on the roof of the cabin all day drinking Flemish&#10;beer, shouting for Isidor, his servant, and talking gallantly to the&#10;ladies.&#10;&#10;His courage was prodigious.  &quot;Boney attack us!&quot; he cried.  &quot;My dear&#10;creature, my poor Emmy, don't be frightened.

Jos&#10;went in a collapsed state to an inn, while Captain Dobbin escorted the&#10;ladies, and then busied himself in freeing Jos's carriage and luggage&#10;from the ship and the custom-house, for Mr. Jos was at present without&#10;a servant, Osborne's man and his own pampered menial having conspired&#10;together at Chatham, and refused point-blank to cross the water.

This can be inferred from George's reaction when he says, &quot;It's not in my father's handwriting...&quot;, indicating that he was expecting a letter from his father but received it through Dobbin instead.&#10;&#10;2. Rawdon Crawley responds to Dobbin's presence with indifference, seeing him as a &quot;good-natured nincompoop and under-bred City man.&quot; Jos, on the other hand, patronizes Dobbin with dignity, highlighting the social dynamics at play. The differences in how Dobbin is perceived by George's close acquaintances further emphasize his subdued and selfless character in contrast to their more self-serving attitudes." />
    <node id="George received the news from William that the enemy had passed the Sambre and their left is already engaged. This means that they are to march in three hours for battle. This news caused him to rush off to his quarters with excitement, reconsidering his past life and future chances, and regretting a recent action he had done, which was squandering most of his money on gambling and other unnecessary expenses, leaving his wife with little means if anything were to happen to him in the battle." />

Drink yourself, and light up your&#10;lantern jaws, old boy.  Here's to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dobbin went up and whispered something to him, at which George, giving&#10;a start and a wild hurray, tossed off his glass, clapped it on the&#10;table, and walked away speedily on his friend's arm.  &quot;The enemy has&#10;passed the Sambre,&quot; William said, &quot;and our left is already engaged.&#10;Come away.  We are to march in three hours.&quot;&#10;&#10;Away went George, his nerves quivering with excitement at the news so&#10;long looked for, so sudden when it came.  What were love and intrigue&#10;now?  He thought about a thousand things but these in his rapid walk to&#10;his quarters--his past life and future chances--the fate which might be&#10;before him--the wife, the child perhaps, from whom unseen he might be&#10;about to part.

Time out of mind strength and courage have been&#10;the theme of bards and romances; and from the story of Troy down to&#10;to-day, poetry has always chosen a soldier for a hero.  I wonder is it&#10;because men are cowards in heart that they admire bravery so much, and&#10;place military valour so far beyond every other quality for reward and&#10;worship?&#10;&#10;So, at the sound of that stirring call to battle, George jumped away&#10;from the gentle arms in which he had been dallying; not without a&#10;feeling of shame (although his wife's hold on him had been but feeble),&#10;that he should have been detained there so long.  The same feeling of&#10;eagerness and excitement was amongst all those friends of his of whom&#10;we have had occasional glimpses, from the stout senior Major, who led&#10;the regiment into action, to little Stubble, the Ensign, who was to&#10;bear its colours on that day.&#10;&#10;The sun was just rising as the march began--it was a gallant sight--the&#10;band led the column, playing the regimental march--" />
    <node id="1. Mr. Osborne's nonchalant attitude towards his infidelity can be attributed to his belief in his status as a &quot;woman-killer&quot; and his entitlement to conquer in love, which he perceives as a source of pride and respect amongst men. This mindset is reinforced by the social norms of Vanity Fair, where conquests in love are considered prestigious, much like victories in war.&#10;2. Additionally, Mr. Osborne's indifference towards his wife's feelings and her &quot;instinctive repulsion&quot; towards his adoration of Amelia suggests that he places little value on her emotions or loyalty. This further contributes to his nonchalant attitude towards his infidelity.&#10;3. Mr. Osborne's assumption that conquering in love is a source of pride and respect amongst men stems from the historical context of Vanity Fair, where such behavior has been celebrated for a long time. This notion is reflected in the behavior of schoolboys boasting about their amours, as well as the popularity of characters like Don Juan, who are known for their numerous romantic conquests." />

It is a shame, he owned to&#10;himself; but hang it, if a pretty woman WILL throw herself in your way,&#10;why, what can a fellow do, you know?  I AM rather free about women, he&#10;had often said, smiling and nodding knowingly to Stubble and Spooney,&#10;and other comrades of the mess-table; and they rather respected him&#10;than otherwise for this prowess.  Next to conquering in war, conquering&#10;in love has been a source of pride, time out of mind, amongst men in&#10;Vanity Fair, or how should schoolboys brag of their amours, or Don Juan&#10;be popular?&#10;&#10;So Mr. Osborne, having a firm conviction in his own mind that he was a&#10;woman-killer and destined to conquer, did not run counter to his fate,&#10;but yielded himself up to it quite complacently.  And as Emmy did not&#10;say much or plague him with her jealousy, but merely became unhappy and&#10;pined over it miserably in secret, he chose to fancy that she was not&#10;suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly aware--namely,&#10;that" />

This determination&#10;is final and irrevocable.&#10;&#10;&quot;Although the monies expended upon you in your minority, and the bills&#10;which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years, far exceed&#10;in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right (being&#10;the third part of the fortune of your mother, the late Mrs. Osborne and&#10;which reverted to you at her decease, and to Miss" />

He&#10;rode with her whenever she was free.  He pretended regimental business&#10;to Amelia (by which falsehood she was not in the least deceived), and&#10;consigning his wife to solitude or her brother's society, passed his&#10;evenings in the Crawleys' company; losing money to the husband and&#10;flattering himself that the wife was dying of love for him. It is very&#10;likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspired and agreed&#10;together in so many words:  the one to cajole the young gentleman,&#10;whilst the other won his money at cards: but they understood each other&#10;perfectly well, and Rawdon let Osborne come and go with entire good&#10;humour.&#10;&#10;George was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and William&#10;Dobbin were by no means so much together as formerly. George avoided&#10;him in public and in the regiment, and, as we see, did not like those&#10;sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him." />

On the other hand, Rawdon's nods towards Dobbin were described as &quot;of the very faintest specimens of politeness.&quot; This suggests that Rawdon had little interest or enthusiasm in greeting Dobbin, and their interaction was not warm or friendly.&#10;3. The reason for Rawdon's lukewarm greeting is not explicitly stated in the text, but it could be due to a variety of factors such as personal dislike, indifference, or preoccupation with other matters. It's also possible that Rawdon and Dobbin had a history of strained relations, leading to Rawdon's cool reception. Without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for Rawdon's behavior." />

And as for Rawdon, he turned as red as&#10;scarlet, and wrung off Briggs's hand, so great was his rapture and his&#10;confusion at the meeting. Perhaps it was interest that moved him:  or&#10;perhaps affection:  perhaps he was touched by the change which the&#10;illness of the last weeks had wrought in his aunt.&#10;&#10;&quot;The old girl has always acted like a trump to me,&quot; he said to his&#10;wife, as he narrated the interview, &quot;and I felt, you know, rather&#10;queer, and that sort of thing.

    <node id="At the end of George's &quot;day of business,&quot; he has successfully obtained a thousand pounds from his father, which he considers an immense deal of money. He is pleased with himself, as this sum will allow him to pay for all his baggage and outfit, and to settle Amelia's purchases with cheques on his agents. George's behavior during the day has been bold and confident, drawing out every shilling from his father and spending it with splendor.&#10;&#10;Amelia and Captain Dobbin play a part in George's successful day by providing support and companionship. Amelia, though initially reluctant to visit the Crawleys, eventually joins her husband and they visit Crawley and his wife at their quarters. Her manners, however, are such that George scolds her for her evident unwillingness to go and the high and mighty manner in which she comports herself towards Mrs. Crawley.&#10;&#10;Captain Dobbin, on the other hand, plays a crucial role by accompanying Amelia when she joins her husband's regiment at Chatham. His presence brings comfort to Amelia, who recognizes his friendly countenance as soon as she arrives. George, in high spirits, agrees that Amelia should bear him company during his military service, and Dobbin keeps quiet about the dangers of war, allowing Amelia to believe that there is no immediate danger. Overall, Amelia and Captain Dobbin's presence provides emotional support and comfort to George, contributing to his successful day of business." />

She also wants to mend fences with Miss Briggs by expressing gratitude for staying loyal to Miss Crawley during her illness, despite Rebecca's sudden departure from the house in Park Lane.

    <node id="In this scene from &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; several relationships and feelings are depicted among the characters.  First, there is the relationship between Amelia and her mother, Mrs. Sedley. The narrative highlights their close bond, with Mrs. Sedley expressing her affection by preparing a festive welcome for Amelia's arrival after her marriage. This includes purchasing fashionable items for Amelia's mother-in-law's upcoming foreign tour and preparing a magnificent ornamented tea with muffins and orange marmalade for Amelia's homecoming.&#10;&#10;When Amelia arrives, the reunion with her father is described as emotional, with both mother and daughter weeping with joy. However, Old Mr. Sedley, Amelia's father, responds differently. He is occupied with his papers and tapes and only kisses Amelia warmly when she enters the room. After a short time, he wisely leaves the little apartment in their possession, showing respect for their emotional moment.&#10;&#10;The role of the valet and Mr. Clapp, the gardener, is also highlighted in this scene. George's valet looks at Mr. Clapp in a supercilious manner, suggesting a class divide between the two characters. Meanwhile, Mr. Clapp is watering his rose-bushes when Jos Sedley and George Osborne leave the wine merchant's, indicating a sense of calmness and simplicity in contrast to the more extravagant activities of the other characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene highlights the emotional connections between family members, the class distinctions between different characters, and the various ways that people express their feelings and interact with one another." />
    <node id="Mrs. O'Dowd is the wife of Major O'Dowd, who commands a regiment in the army. She plays a significant role in welcoming Amelia, George Osborne's wife, to the regiment and mess-room society. Mrs. O'Dowd is known for her vivacious personality and accepting nature, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. After the regiment's departure, she spends her time reading religious texts, such as her uncle the Dean's sermons, although it is implied that she may not fully understand the material. Despite this, her devotion to these texts suggests a sense of comfort and stability in her life. Her actions demonstrate her active role in the regiment and her dedication to maintaining close-knit relationships with its members, even when they are away." />

It had been of great comfort to her on board the transport as&#10;they were coming home, and were very nearly wrecked, on their return&#10;from the West Indies.  After the regiment's departure she betook&#10;herself to this volume for meditation; perhaps she did not understand&#10;much of what she was reading, and her thoughts were elsewhere:  but the&#10;sleep project, with poor Mick's nightcap there on the pillow, was quite&#10;a vain one.

This change occurred when he was around seventy years old and his hair, which was very scarce and white at the time, became thick and brown.&#10;&#10;These dramatic changes in Sir George Tufto's appearance led to rumors about the authenticity of his hair, with some people speculating that his chest is &quot;all wool&quot; and that his hair is a wig because it never grows. These rumors are further fueled by the fact that Sir George Tufto's grandpapa reportedly lost his hair after an encounter with Mademoiselle de Jaisey in the green-room, leading some to wonder if there is a genetic predisposition for hair loss in the family. However, it is important to note that these rumors are not confirmed and are simply speculation based on Sir George Tufto's dramatic change in appearance.">

According to the narrative, &quot;it requires many, many years--and a man must be very bad indeed--before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession.&quot; This suggests that the woman has been deeply invested in the idea of her hero as a perfect figure, and acknowledging his faults would mean admitting that her judgment or idealization was misguided.&#10;&#10;As she contemplates spending the night in her old bedroom versus the grand hotel she must now stay in, she experiences a range of emotions. She feels dismay at the thought of sharing a room with Rebecca, but also nostalgia and longing for her past life. The bed she used to sleep in is associated with many nights of weeping and despair, as well as parental affection that she may have taken for granted. Now that she has married and entered a new phase of life, she feels a sense of shame when looking back at her former self, who was so focused on one desire (marrying her hero) that she neglected other aspects of her life. The grand hotel, in contrast, represents her new social standing as a married woman, but it also fills her with terror, highlighting the pressure and expectations that come with her new role.">

In contrast, George Osborne went to see Mr. Kean perform in Shylock at half-price at the play as he was a great lover of drama.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley, Amelia's mother, expressed her kindness and affection by preparing a festive welcome for her daughter's arrival after her marriage.

    <edge source="In the narrative, Amelia and her mother, Mrs. Sedley, are preparing for Mrs. George Osborne's (Amelia's mother-in-law) upcoming foreign tour. They spent their day shopping together, traveling around in a carriage from one store to another, visiting milliners, linen-drapers, and other shops. Both ladies were engaged in purchasing items required for Mrs. George Osborne's fashionable outfit for the tour, with obsequious shopmen and polite owners accompanying them.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley was sincerely happy while shopping, as it reminded her of her better days before their misfortunes. Amelia also joined her mother in this pleasure, buying herself some new things as well, demonstrating a great deal of taste and elegant discernment.&#10;&#10;The narrative highlights the bond between the two women, with Mrs. Sedley expressing her affection by preparing festive refreshments for Amelia's arrival after her marriage, such as muffins and orange marmalade spread out in a little cut-glass saucer. Overall, their day is filled with shopping, companionship, and preparations to bid farewell to Mrs. George Osborne as she embarks on her journey." target="In this scene from &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; several relationships and feelings are depicted among the characters.  First, there is the relationship between Amelia and her mother, Mrs. Sedley. The narrative highlights their close bond, with Mrs. Sedley expressing her affection by preparing a festive welcome for Amelia's arrival after her marriage. This includes purchasing fashionable items for Amelia's mother-in-law's upcoming foreign tour and preparing a magnificent ornamented tea with muffins and orange marmalade for Amelia's homecoming.&#10;&#10;When Amelia arrives, the reunion with her father is described as emotional, with both mother and daughter weeping with joy. However, Old Mr. Sedley, Amelia's father, responds differently. He is occupied with his papers and tapes and only kisses Amelia warmly when she enters the room. After a short time, he wisely leaves the little apartment in their possession, showing respect for their emotional moment.&#10;&#10;The role of the valet and Mr. Clapp, the gardener, is also highlighted in this scene. George's valet looks at Mr. Clapp in a supercilious manner, suggesting a class divide between the two characters. Meanwhile, Mr. Clapp is watering his rose-bushes when Jos Sedley and George Osborne leave the wine merchant's, indicating a sense of calmness and simplicity in contrast to the more extravagant activities of the other characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene highlights the emotional connections between family members, the class distinctions between different characters, and the various ways that people express their feelings and interact with one another.">

First, there is the relationship between Amelia and her mother, Mrs. Sedley. The narrative highlights their close bond, with Mrs. Sedley expressing her affection by preparing a festive welcome for Amelia's arrival after her marriage. This includes purchasing fashionable items for Amelia's mother-in-law's upcoming foreign tour and preparing a magnificent ornamented tea with muffins and orange marmalade for Amelia's homecoming.&#10;&#10;When Amelia arrives, the reunion with her father is described as emotional, with both mother and daughter weeping with joy. However, Old Mr. Sedley, Amelia's father, responds differently. He is occupied with his papers and tapes and only kisses Amelia warmly when she enters the room. After a short time, he wisely leaves the little apartment in their possession, showing respect for their emotional moment.&#10;&#10;The role of the valet and Mr. Clapp, the gardener, is also highlighted in this scene. George's valet looks at Mr. Clapp in a supercilious manner, suggesting a class divide between the two characters. Meanwhile, Mr. Clapp is watering his rose-bushes when Jos Sedley and George Osborne leave the wine merchant's, indicating a sense of calmness and simplicity in contrast to the more extravagant activities of the other characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene highlights the emotional connections between family members, the class distinctions between different characters, and the various ways that people express their feelings and interact with one another.">

    <node id="The importance and challenges of food for men on ships are highlighted by the historical example of &quot;Lobscousers,&quot; who were sailors in the early days of sea-faring. The term &quot;Lobscousers&quot; refers to these sailors' consumption of liquid hash, which was a prominent part of their marine menu. This reflects the significance of food in the daily lives of seafarers, as they had to rely on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages.&#10;&#10;The name &quot;Limey&quot; given to British sailors also stems from their dietary habits. It refers to the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into their diet in the form of limes, which was intended to prevent scurvy. This further illustrates how food played a crucial role in the health and survival of seafarers throughout history.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the text mentions that modern Marsmen are called &quot;Slimeheads,&quot; honoring the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that they consume. This further emphasizes the centrality of food to the lives of those aboard ships, as their dietary habits shape their identities even in contemporary times.&#10;&#10;The history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list, indicating that the study of food and its role in shaping human history is essential. The extermination of whales, the introduction of diseases like syphilis to new populations, and the colonization of new lands have all been influenced by dietary habits and the challenges of feeding large groups of people on ships. Therefore, understanding the historical significance of food for seafarers can provide valuable insights into broader human history." />

    <node id=" Lobscousers,&#10; celebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The&#10; Limey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into&#10; his diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age&#10; only as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen&#10; are called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the&#10; road to the larger Space without.&#10; &#10; Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in&#10; history—whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis&#10; to the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with&#10; cross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire—he is referred to the&#10; hundred-and-first chapter of Moby Dick , a book spooled in the&#10; amusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that&#10; no Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more&#10; than a week from groundfall.

Your first efforts were so hideous as to require&#10; a geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere&#10; edibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will&#10; have learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics&#10; student. That will be all, Bailey.&quot;&#10; &#10; The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of&#10; Bailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their&#10; Captain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark&#10; on an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last&#10; few days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many&#10; memories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had&#10; lost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,&#10; seemed to have gained. His uniform" />

He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.&#10; Slimeheads remember the H. M. S.

Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from&#10; the Ajax in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think&#10; of the Benjo Maru incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed&#10; his algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing Saccharomycodes yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at&#10; Piano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into&#10; the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent&#10; bite he ate to a superior grade of sake .

Do you understand, Sir?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I understand,&quot; Winkelmann growled. &quot;You intend that your latest mess&#10; should feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;Well, I squeezed the&#10; steak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special&#10; seasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal&#10; oil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out. Voila! I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine&#10; meat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Remarkable, Bailey,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with&#10; our food,&quot; the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of&#10; distaste. &quot;It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example," />

Detail spoils&#10; the meal.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of&#10; the table and tenderly lifted a small &quot;steak&quot; onto each of our plates.&#10;&quot;Try it,&quot; he urged the Captain.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The&#10; color was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell&#10; of fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. &quot;Not&#10; too bad, Belly-Robber,&quot; he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed&#10; his head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A&#10; kind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a&#10; more reasonable man. &quot;But it still needs something ... something,&quot;&#10; Winkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.&#10;&quot;Aha! I have it" />
    <node id="Captain Winkelmann treats Bailey harshly and sets high expectations for him because he wants Bailey to find a way to produce good food using Chlorella tanks during their journey to Mars. The Captain believes that Bailey has the ability to improve his culinary skills, even when starting with unappetizing ingredients like Chlorella. This harsh treatment is intended to motivate Bailey to experiment, improvise, and widen his horizons of ingenuity, hoping that he will eventually learn to create edible and enjoyable meals from the algae-based food source.&#10;&#10;The Captain's primary concern is their journey to Mars, and ensuring that the crew remains well-fed throughout the trip. The harsh treatment is a means to an end – achieving a reliable and tasty food source for his crew, despite the challenging circumstances of space travel. By pushing Bailey to his limits, Winkelmann ultimately improves morale on the ship, as the crew enjoys better meals and remains healthier during their long journey." />
    <node id="&#10; Bailey asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;He was driving you to do the impossible,&quot; I said; &quot;and you did it. Our&#10; Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum&#10; performance out of his Ship's Cook.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bailey stood up. &quot;Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.&#10; He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good&#10; of the ship and his crew. &quot;Do I like Captain Winkelmann?&quot; I asked,&#10; spearing another piece of my artificial steak. &quot;Bailey, I'm afraid I'll&#10; have to admit that I do.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my&#10; plate. &quot;Then have another piece,&quot; he said." />
    <node id="'s taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of&#10; Israel would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the&#10; mother of invention.

He will learn&#10; somehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're driving him too hard, Sir,&quot; I said. &quot;He'll crack.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we&#10; ground at Brady Station,&quot; Captain Winkelmann said. &quot;So much money buys&#10; many discomforts.

He brought out a bottle and unscrewed&#10; the cap. &quot;Ketchup,&quot; he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's&#10; masterpiece. &quot;The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.&quot;&#10; Lifting a hunk of the &quot;steak,&quot; streaming ketchup, to his mouth,&#10; Winkelmann chewed. &quot;Just the thing,&quot; he smiled.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn you!&quot; Bailey shouted.&#10; &#10; Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.&#10; &#10; &quot;... Sir,&quot; Bailey added.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's better,&quot; Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said&#10; meditatively, &quot;Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have&#10; sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a&#10; bottle on the table for all my future" />
    <node id=" he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate&#10; the appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned&#10; by that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at&#10; mealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. &quot;Convey my&#10; compliments to the Chef, please,&quot; the Captain would instruct one of&#10; the crew, &quot;and ask him to step down here a moment.&quot; And the Cook would&#10; cheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius&#10; acidly called in question again.&#10; &#10; I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go&#10; into Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in&#10; brilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an ersatz hot&#10; turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella&#10; turkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy&#10; a grainy and delicious &quot;cornbread,&quot; and had extracted from his algae&#10; a lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot &quot;bread&quot; with a&#10; genuinely dairy smell. &quot;Splendid, Bailey,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;We are not" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Doc, do you like Winkelmann?&quot; the Cook asked me.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not much,&quot; I said. &quot;I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can&#10; give his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got&#10; to live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;The fat swine!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,&quot; I&#10; said. &quot;He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in&#10; my time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It&#10; was green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. &quot;This&#10; is what I have to work with,&quot; he said. He tossed the stuff back into&#10; its bin. &quot;In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,&#10; we'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll never make Winkelmann" />
    <node id="1. Food as a necessity and morale booster: The traditions of sailor's food and drink highlight the importance of food in historical endeavors such as exploring the seas. Sailors relied on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages, making food a crucial factor in their health, survival, and overall morale. This concept is still relevant today, as demonstrated by the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; given to Marsmen. The name emphasizes the centrality of algae-based food (Chlorella and Scenedesmus) for sustenance in space, just as liquid hash and citrus were essential for early seafarers.&#10;   &#10;2. Identity and representation: Just like how &quot;Lobscousers&quot; and &quot;Limey&quot; reflected the dietary habits of early sailors, the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; represents the unique challenge of feeding large groups of people on spaceships using algae as a primary food source. The term signifies the adaptability and resilience required to survive in harsh environments, emphasizing the significance of understanding historical dietary practices in shaping human identities and histories.&#10;&#10;3. Overcoming challenges through innovation: Seafarers had to innovate and adapt their diets due to limited supplies and the need for preservation, leading to unique food traditions like liquid hash and citrus-infused gin-and-tonic. Similarly, Marsmen have embraced algae as a primary food source, pushing the boundaries of what is considered edible and developing new methods of producing and consuming food in space.&#10;&#10;In summary, the traditions of sailor's food and drink tell us about the importance of food in historical endeavors like exploring the seas by highlighting its role in meeting basic needs, shaping identities, and providing morale boosts during challenging voyages. The name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; for Marsmen and the significance of algae in settling space demonstrate that these lessons remain relevant today, as humans continue to push the boundaries of exploration and adaptation in new environments." />
    <node id=" alien yeast had got into&#10; the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent&#10; bite he ate to a superior grade of sake . And for a third footnote to&#10; the ancient observation, &quot;God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,&quot;&#10; Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the Charles Partlow&#10; Sale .&#10; &#10; The Sale blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due&#10; in at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking&#10; the low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the&#10; human period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir&#10; seedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed—these to be planted&#10; in the maria to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had&#10; aboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's&#10; Surgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,&#10; the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest.

    <node id="The Ship's Cook plays a crucial role in the morale and well-being of the crew on a spacer, as demonstrated by historical examples such as the H.M.S. Ajax fiasco and the Benjo Maru incident. By transforming offal into edible meals, the Ship's Cook performs a daily miracle that can significantly impact the mental state of the crew. Good cooking can boost morale, while poor cooking can lead to discontent, mutiny, or even poisoning.&#10;&#10;In the case of the H.M.S. Ajax fiasco, a galleyman's negligence in handling heavy water from the ship's shielding contaminated Chlorella tanks, leading to deuterium poisoning among the crew members. This incident highlights the importance of proper food preparation and storage on a spacer.&#10;&#10;The Benjo Maru incident involved a Ship's Cook allowing algae-based staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing Saccharomycodes yeast, causing every man aboard to consume an alcoholic substance that fermented each bite they ate into sake. This example shows how a minor mistake in food preparation can have severe consequences for the entire crew.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the Ship's Cook wields significant power over the well-being and morale of the crew on a spacer, making their role indispensable to the success of any mission." />
    <node id=" Robert Bailey.&#10; &#10; Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating&#10; tensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,&#10; dietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to&#10; see that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of&#10; water, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.&#10; This isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a&#10; statement of the least fuel a man can run on.&#10; &#10; Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo&#10; compartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the C. P. Sale no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to&#10; work over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons&#10; of metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West&#10; and back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,&#10; protein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the&#10; algae fed us.&#10; &#10; All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble&#10; from our" />
    <node id="Captain Winkelmann was not impressed with the cook's attempt at making a meat substitute and dessert for the crew. He criticized the cook's use of synthetic onions and cycler-salt, and ultimately referred to the food as &quot;this Schweinerei&quot; which means &quot;filth&quot; in his home country's language. The captain refused to eat it, stating that &quot;Mensch ist was er isst&quot; which means &quot;you are what you eat&quot;, implying that he did not want to become the &quot;filth&quot; the cook was feeding him. He also expressed his displeasure with the food by leaving the table and climbing up the ladder from the dining-cubby after making the comment." />
    <node id=" heads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The pièce de&#10; résistance was again a &quot;hamburger steak;&quot; but this time the algaeal&#10; mass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only&#10; faintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had&#10; been sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. &quot;It's&#10; so tender,&quot; the radioman joked, &quot;that I can hardly believe it's really&#10; steak.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently&#10; imploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big&#10; man's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.&#10;&quot;Belly-Robber,&quot; Winkelmann said, &quot;I had almost rather you served me&#10; this pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and&#10; cycler-salt.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,&quot; I said. I&#10; gazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" repasts with pinches of oregano&#10; and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,&#10; textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the&#10; slabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.&#10; For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of&#10; the carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.&#10;&quot;Belly-Robber,&quot; he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,&#10;&quot;you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun&#10; in my home country: Mensch ist was er isst. It means, you are what&#10; you eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this Schweinerei you are feeding me.&quot; Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin&#10; with his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the&#10; ladder from the dining-cubby.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Doc, do you like Winkelmann?&quot; the Cook asked me.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not much,&quot; I said. &quot;I suspect that" />
    <node id="The surprising discovery made about the chef's prepared &quot;steaks&quot; during dinner time in the Sale's mess compartment was that they actually tasted like food, having a spine-tingling barbecue tang. This revelation affected the expectations of the crew members positively, as it showed that the chef had succeeded in making an edible and enjoyable meal from the Chlorella tanks, which was a significant challenge due to the unappetizing nature of this algae-based food source. The first-shift diners expressed their excitement by praising the chef's accomplishment and comparing it to beating Captain Winkelmann at his game, demonstrating that the tasty &quot;steaks&quot; exceeded their initial expectations." />
    <node id=" and hurried back into his galley&#10; oblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; There being only three seats in the Sale's mess compartment, we ate&#10; our meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to&#10; supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell&#10; to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,&#10; of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss&#10; of canned beer being church-keyed. &quot;He's done it, Doc!&quot; one of the&#10; first-shift diners said. &quot;It actually tastes of food!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then he's beat the Captain at his game,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,&quot; the crewman&#10; said.&#10; &#10; I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric&#10; warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of&#10; us with the small &quot;steaks.&quot; Each contained about a pound of dried&#10; Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Captain Winkelmann's opinion of the taste and texture of the algae-based steak is that it is &quot;not too bad&quot; and has a &quot;steak-like&quot; texture, which Bailey had intentionally aimed for. The Captain suggests that an additional ingredient to improve it could be essence-of-steak and garlic, as he finds the flavor more appealing with these additions. However, the Captain is still critical of Bailey's attempts to please him with these algae-based dishes, as he had often found fault with them in the past." />
    <node id="The speaker, the Ship's Surgeon, has mixed feelings about Captain Winkelmann's leadership style. On one hand, he acknowledges that the Captain is good at his job and knows how to bring out the best performance from his crew, including Bailey, the Ship's Cook. The speaker admits to liking Captain Winkelmann despite his harsh treatment of Bailey and others. This admission suggests that, while the speaker may not always agree with the Captain's methods, he recognizes the value of having a strong leader who can make tough decisions and drive results.&#10;&#10;Bailey, on the other hand, reacts to this admission by exploding into weeping and banging his fists against the metal bulkhead. He is clearly distressed by the constant criticism and harsh treatment from Captain Winkelmann, despite the speaker's reassurance that he is an excellent cook and has met or exceeded the expectations of other officers and crew members. Bailey's emotional response suggests that the pressure to meet the Captain's unrelenting standards is taking a toll on him, even if his culinary creations continue to improve." />
    <node id=", his fists knotted, was&#10; scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.&#10; &#10; &quot;Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's&#10; Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,&quot; Winkelmann said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,&quot; I said. &quot;The other officers&#10; and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,&quot; Winkelmann said.&#10;&quot;Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,&quot; he added.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him&#10; to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my&#10; bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal&#10; bulkhead. &quot;You'll have that drink now,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, dammit!&quot; he shouted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Orders,&quot; I said.

    <node id="1. Decline in food quality: The transition from sea to space led to a significant decline in the quality of food for sailors. Early space travelers had to rely on protein squeezings from aluminum tubes, which was a far cry from the steak and fried potatoes they enjoyed back on land.&#10;&#10;2. Limited supplies and preservation: Just like their seafaring counterparts who innovated and adapted their diets due to limited supplies and the need for preservation, space explorers also faced similar challenges. This led to unique food traditions in space, such as consuming algae-based foods, which pushed the boundaries of what was considered edible and required new methods of producing and consuming food.&#10;&#10;3. Shift in dietary habits: Space travel introduced a shift in dietary habits for sailors, with algae-based foods like Chlorella becoming a primary source of nutrition for Marsmen. This change not only reflected the challenges of feeding large groups of people on spaceships but also highlighted the adaptability and resilience required to survive in harsh environments.&#10;&#10;4. Historical significance: Understanding the historical significance of food for seafarers provides valuable insights into broader human history, including the extermination of whales, the introduction of diseases like syphilis to new populations, and the colonization of new lands. Similarly, studying the dietary habits and challenges faced by space explorers can offer essential lessons for future long-duration missions and human survival in extraterrestrial environments." />

    <node id="Captain Willy Winkelmann played a significant role in creating a challenging work environment for Robert Bailey during their space voyage. The Captain's primary concern was to have a reliable and tasty food source for his crew throughout the journey to Mars, which led him to set high expectations for Bailey as the Ship's Cook.&#10;&#10;Winkelmann treated Bailey harshly, criticizing his culinary creations and constantly challenging him to improve. He ordered Bailey to experiment with Chlorella tanks as a food source, expecting him to find ways to produce good food despite the unappetizing ingredients. This pressure from the Captain caused Bailey considerable stress, even though he was an excellent cook and had met or exceeded the expectations of other officers and crew members.&#10;&#10;The story also mentions that Winkelmann often called Bailey to question his culinary skills personally, which added to the challenging work environment. Additionally, the Captain discussed haut cuisine and noble wines with others while they ate algaeburgers and utility water, further highlighting Bailey's struggle to meet his expectations.&#10;&#10;Winkelmann's constant criticism, along with his unrealistic demands for delicious meals from Chlorella-based ingredients, created a stressful work environment for Bailey on their space voyage." />

He criticized the use of synthetic onions and cycler-salt, referring to the food as &quot;Schweinerei,&quot; which means &quot;filth&quot; in his home country's language. The captain refused to eat it and made a comment saying &quot;Mensch ist was er isst,&quot; implying that he did not want to become the &quot;filth&quot; the cook was feeding him. This reaction led to the cook, Bailey, becoming distressed and emotional, as he had been facing constant criticism from the captain despite meeting or exceeding the expectations of other crew members. The pressure from the captain's unrelenting standards was taking a toll on Bailey, even if his culinary creations continued to improve." />
    <node id="Based on the story, the crew's cooking skills have significantly improved on their journey, as evidenced by the amusement of their fellow officers and their steady weight maintenance. Despite Captain Winkelmann's harsh criticism, the crew has managed to consistently prepare meals that are not only edible but also satisfying. Bailey, the Ship's Cook, has even managed to create a meat substitute and dessert using algae, which has received positive feedback from the officers and crew members.&#10;&#10;Captain Winkelmann himself, known for his harsh criticism of Bailey, has gained weight during the journey, indicating that he finds the food palatable enough to eat regularly. The fact that none of the men have lost weight during the first four months in space also suggests that the food is nutritious and satisfying enough to meet their caloric needs.&#10;&#10;However, it's worth noting that while the crew's cooking skills have improved, Bailey continues to face constant criticism from Captain Winkelmann, which has taken a toll on him emotionally. Despite this, he remains committed to improving and meeting the Captain's expectations." />
    <node id="Captain Winkelmann had a mixed opinion about the cook's attempt to make a meat substitute and dessert. He found the texture of the algae-based steak to be &quot;steak-like&quot; and not too bad, but he suggested adding essence-of-steak and garlic for improved flavor. However, his reaction towards Bailey's efforts was predominantly negative due to his constant criticism and high expectations of Bailey as the Ship's Cook.&#10;&#10;The negative response can be attributed to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Criticism of ingredients: The Captain criticized Bailey's use of synthetic onions and cycler-salt, which he considered &quot;filth.&quot; This rejection of modern food technology could have colored his overall opinion of the dish.&#10;2. High expectations: As a demanding leader, Winkelmann held high standards for the crew, particularly for Bailey. He was not easily impressed and expressed his disappointment when the outcome did not meet his expectations.&#10;3. Emotional toll on Bailey: The constant criticism took an emotional toll on Bailey, causing distress and sadness. While this doesn't directly relate to Winkelmann's opinion of the food, it might have influenced the Captain's overall negative reaction.&#10;4. Desire for noble foods: Throughout their journey, Winkelmann enjoyed discussing haute cuisine and noble wines while eating simple meals like algaeburgers and utility water. This contrast in expectations could contribute to his displeasure with Bailey's creations.&#10;5. Personal stress: The Captain himself gained weight during the voyage, indicating that he found the food palatable enough to eat regularly. However, Winkelmann's personal pressure to maintain high standards for the crew might have made it difficult for him to appreciate the cook's efforts wholeheartedly." />
    <node id="1. Algae (Chlorella) played a significant role in sustaining the crew's life during space travel by serving as a primary food source. By recycling organic waste, air, water, and other effluents through Chlorella tanks, the ship could produce metabolites to support the crew's nutritional needs throughout the journey.&#10;2. Human hair, stubble from shaving, clippings from haircuts, and other waste materials were also used as fertilizer for the Chlorella tanks. This process allowed the crew to minimize waste while maximizing their food supply.&#10;3. The algae-based food source was versatile and could be dried, bleached, disguised, seasoned, and served in various ways, acting as a meat substitute and providing essential nutrients for the crew. By reusing all waste materials on board, the crew could maintain their health and well-being during the long space voyage." />

Even the stubble&#10; from our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route&#10; and back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in&#10; essential amino acids.&#10; &#10; The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the&#10; smell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a&#10; hundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite&#10; wore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of&#10; oxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the&#10; end of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the&#10; glomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling&#10; politicians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a&#10; breed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of&#10; squeamishness.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife&#10; in space. My" />
    <node id="The Ship's Cook on a spacer plays an indispensable role in the success of any mission due to their significant power over the well-being and morale of the crew. This importance is demonstrated by historical examples such as the H.M.S. Ajax fiasco and the Benjo Maru incident.&#10;&#10;In the H.M.S. Ajax fiasco, a galleyman's negligence in handling heavy water from the ship's shielding contaminated Chlorella tanks, leading to deuterium poisoning among the crew members. This incident highlights the importance of proper food preparation and storage on a spacer, as poor handling can lead to severe consequences for the entire crew.&#10;&#10;The Benjo Maru incident involved a Ship's Cook allowing algae-based staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing Saccharomycodes yeast, causing every man aboard to consume an alcoholic substance that fermented each bite they ate into sake. This example shows how a minor mistake in food preparation can have severe consequences for the entire crew.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is crucial that the Ship's Cook performs their role with diligence and expertise, as they are responsible for transforming offal into edible meals, which can significantly impact the mental state of the crew. Good cooking can boost morale, while poor cooking can lead to discontent, mutiny, or even poisoning. The Ship's Cook plays a daily miracle that can significantly impact the success of any mission on a spacer." />

    <node id="Captain Winkelmann is pushing Bailey to prepare good food from Chlorella tanks in order to ensure a reliable and tasty food source for the crew during their journey to Mars. The Captain believes that Bailey has the ability to improve his culinary skills, even when starting with unappetizing ingredients like Chlorella, as a means of motivating him to experiment, improvise, and widen his horizons of ingenuity. This harsh treatment ultimately improves morale on the ship, as the crew enjoys better meals and remains healthier during their long journey.&#10;&#10;Captain Winkelmann does not directly address concerns about crew morale because he is focused on the primary goal of a successful space voyage, which is to reach Mars safely and efficiently. His leadership style prioritizes results and high performance, even if it causes discomfort for some crew members like Bailey. The Captain's perspective is that his harsh treatment is a necessary means to achieve the end goal of a well-fed and healthy crew.&#10;&#10;In summary, Captain Winkelmann pushes Bailey to prepare good food from Chlorella tanks in order to ensure a reliable food source for the crew during their space voyage, prioritizing results over individual comfort or concerns about morale." />

    <node id="1. Food as a necessity and vital component: The traditions of sailor's food and drink highlight the importance of food in historical endeavors such as exploring the seas. Sailors relied on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages, making food a crucial factor in their health, survival, and overall morale. Similarly, algae-based foods like Chlorella are essential for Marsmen's sustenance in space, emphasizing the role of 'belly-furniture' in historical events.&#10;&#10;2. Identity and representation: Just like how &quot;Lobscousers&quot; and &quot;Limey&quot; reflected the dietary habits of early sailors, the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; represents the unique challenge of feeding large groups of people on spaceships using algae as a primary food source. The term signifies the adaptability and resilience required to survive in harsh environments, emphasizing the significance of understanding historical dietary practices in shaping human identities and histories.&#10;&#10;3. Overcoming challenges through innovation: Seafarers had to innovate and adapt their diets due to limited supplies and the need for preservation, leading to unique food traditions like liquid hash and citrus-infused gin-and-tonic. Similarly, Marsmen have embraced algae as a primary food source, pushing the boundaries of what is considered edible and developing new methods of producing and consuming food in space.&#10;&#10;The reference to Moby Dick in the question suggests that understanding the role of 'belly-furniture' in historical events goes beyond mere survival; it also encompasses the human aspects of exploration, including morale, identity, and representation. The Benjo Maru incident further underscores this point by highlighting the importance of proper food preparation and storage on a spacer, with broader implications for understanding and addressing challenges faced during long-duration missions in space or sea." />

    <node id="The effect of giving Bailey alcohol after his outburst was that it helped him calm down. He initially refused the drink but changed his mind after the Ship's Surgeon insisted, stating it was therapy. Bailey drank the rye whiskey quickly and silently held out his glass for more, but the Ship's Surgeon declined to give him any more, saying one drink was enough for now.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide explicit details about how Bailey reacted during morning mess the next day. However, given that he accepted a drink from the Ship's Surgeon and did not continue weeping or expressing hatred towards Winkelmann after having the drink, it can be inferred that the alcohol had a calming effect on him, at least temporarily. Bailey may have felt more composed and able to face Winkelmann again in the morning mess, even though their underlying conflict was not resolved." />

    <edge source="The importance and challenges of food for men on ships are highlighted by the historical example of &quot;Lobscousers,&quot; who were sailors in the early days of sea-faring. The term &quot;Lobscousers&quot; refers to these sailors' consumption of liquid hash, which was a prominent part of their marine menu. This reflects the significance of food in the daily lives of seafarers, as they had to rely on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages.&#10;&#10;The name &quot;Limey&quot; given to British sailors also stems from their dietary habits. It refers to the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into their diet in the form of limes, which was intended to prevent scurvy. This further illustrates how food played a crucial role in the health and survival of seafarers throughout history.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the text mentions that modern Marsmen are called &quot;Slimeheads,&quot; honoring the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that they consume. This further emphasizes the centrality of food to the lives of those aboard ships, as their dietary habits shape their identities even in contemporary times.&#10;&#10;The history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list, indicating that the study of food and its role in shaping human history is essential. The extermination of whales, the introduction of diseases like syphilis to new populations, and the colonization of new lands have all been influenced by dietary habits and the challenges of feeding large groups of people on ships. Therefore, understanding the historical significance of food for seafarers can provide valuable insights into broader human history." target="GOURMET&#10; &#10; &#10; By ALLEN KIM LANG&#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine April 1962.

Ajax fiasco, a galleyman's negligence in handling heavy water from the ship's shielding contaminated Chlorella tanks, leading to deuterium poisoning among the crew members. This incident highlights the importance of proper food preparation and storage on a spacer, as poor handling can lead to severe consequences for the entire crew.&#10;&#10;The Benjo Maru incident involved a Ship's Cook allowing algae-based staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing Saccharomycodes yeast, causing every man aboard to consume an alcoholic substance that fermented each bite they ate into sake. This example shows how a minor mistake in food preparation can have severe consequences for the entire crew.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is crucial that the Ship's Cook performs their role with diligence and expertise, as they are responsible for transforming offal into edible meals, which can significantly impact the mental state of the crew.

And for a" target="1. Food as a necessity and morale booster: The traditions of sailor's food and drink highlight the importance of food in historical endeavors such as exploring the seas. Sailors relied on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages, making food a crucial factor in their health, survival, and overall morale. This concept is still relevant today, as demonstrated by the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; given to Marsmen. The name emphasizes the centrality of algae-based food (Chlorella and Scenedesmus) for sustenance in space, just as liquid hash and citrus were essential for early seafarers.&#10;   &#10;2. Identity and representation: Just like how &quot;Lobscousers&quot; and &quot;Limey&quot; reflected the dietary habits of early sailors, the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; represents the unique challenge of feeding large groups of people on spaceships using algae as a primary food source. The term signifies the adaptability and resilience required to survive in harsh environments, emphasizing the significance of understanding historical dietary practices in shaping human identities and histories.&#10;&#10;3. Overcoming challenges through innovation: Seafarers had to innovate and adapt their diets due to limited supplies and the need for preservation, leading to unique food traditions like liquid hash and citrus-infused gin-and-tonic. Similarly, Marsmen have embraced algae as a primary food source, pushing the boundaries of what is considered edible and developing new methods of producing and consuming food in space.&#10;&#10;In summary, the traditions of sailor's food and drink tell us about the importance of food in historical endeavors like exploring the seas by highlighting its role in meeting basic needs, shaping identities, and providing morale boosts during challenging voyages. The name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; for Marsmen and the significance of algae in settling space demonstrate that these lessons remain relevant today, as humans continue to push the boundaries of exploration and adaptation in new environments.">

The name emphasizes the centrality of algae-based food (Chlorella and Scenedesmus) for sustenance in space, just as liquid hash and citrus were essential for early seafarers.&#10;   &#10;2. Identity and representation: Just like how &quot;Lobscousers&quot; and &quot;Limey&quot; reflected the dietary habits of early sailors, the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; represents the unique challenge of feeding large groups of people on spaceships using algae as a primary food source. The term signifies the adaptability and resilience required to survive in harsh environments, emphasizing the significance of understanding historical dietary practices in shaping human identities and histories.&#10;&#10;3. Overcoming challenges through innovation: Seafarers had to innovate and adapt their diets due to limited supplies and the need for preservation, leading to unique food traditions like liquid hash and citrus-infused gin-and-tonic. Similarly, Marsmen have embraced algae as a primary food source, pushing the boundaries of what is considered edible and developing new methods of producing and consuming food in space.&#10;&#10;In summary, the traditions of sailor's food and drink tell us about the importance of food in historical endeavors like exploring the seas by highlighting its role in meeting basic needs, shaping identities, and providing morale boosts during challenging voyages. The name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; for Marsmen and the significance of algae in settling space demonstrate that these lessons remain relevant today, as humans continue to push the boundaries of exploration and adaptation in new environments.">

However, his reaction towards Bailey's efforts was predominantly negative due to his constant criticism and high expectations of Bailey as the Ship's Cook.&#10;&#10;The negative response can be attributed to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Criticism of ingredients: The Captain criticized Bailey's use of synthetic onions and cycler-salt, which he considered &quot;filth.&quot; This rejection of modern food technology could have colored his overall opinion of the dish.&#10;2. High expectations: As a demanding leader, Winkelmann held high standards for the crew, particularly for Bailey. He was not easily impressed and expressed his disappointment when the outcome did not meet his expectations.&#10;3. Emotional toll on Bailey: The constant criticism took an emotional toll on Bailey, causing distress and sadness. While this doesn't directly relate to Winkelmann's opinion of the food, it might have influenced the Captain's overall negative reaction.&#10;4. Desire for noble foods: Throughout their journey, Winkelmann enjoyed discussing haute cuisine and noble wines while eating simple meals like algaeburgers and utility water. This contrast in expectations could contribute to his displeasure with Bailey's creations.&#10;5. Personal stress: The Captain himself gained weight during the voyage, indicating that he found the food palatable enough to eat regularly. However, Winkelmann's personal pressure to maintain high standards for the crew might have made it difficult for him to appreciate the cook's efforts wholeheartedly.">

And it was&#10; Captain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any&#10; other name than The Kitchen Cabinet.&#10; &#10; Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste&#10; of synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by&#10; Chlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano&#10; and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,&#10; text">

Sailors relied on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages, making food a crucial factor in their health, survival, and overall morale. Similarly, algae-based foods like Chlorella are essential for Marsmen's sustenance in space, emphasizing the role of 'belly-furniture' in historical events.&#10;&#10;2. Identity and representation: Just like how &quot;Lobscousers&quot; and &quot;Limey&quot; reflected the dietary habits of early sailors, the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; represents the unique challenge of feeding large groups of people on spaceships using algae as a primary food source.

This harsh treatment ultimately improves morale on the ship, as the crew enjoys better meals and remains healthier during their long journey.&#10;&#10;Captain Winkelmann does not directly address concerns about crew morale because he is focused on the primary goal of a successful space voyage, which is to reach Mars safely and efficiently.

Sailors relied on limited supplies for sustenance during long voyages, making food a crucial factor in their health, survival, and overall morale. Similarly, algae-based foods like Chlorella are essential for Marsmen's sustenance in space, emphasizing the role of 'belly-furniture' in historical events.&#10;&#10;2. Identity and representation: Just like how &quot;Lobscousers&quot; and &quot;Limey&quot; reflected the dietary habits of early sailors, the name &quot;Slimeheads&quot; represents the unique challenge of feeding large groups of people on spaceships using algae as a primary food source. The term signifies the adaptability and resilience required to survive in harsh environments, emphasizing the significance of understanding historical dietary practices in shaping human identities and histories.&#10;&#10;3. Overcoming challenges through innovation: Seafarers had to innovate and adapt their diets due to limited supplies and the need for preservation, leading to unique food traditions like liquid hash and citrus-infused gin-and-tonic. Similarly, Marsmen have embraced algae as a primary food source, pushing the boundaries of what is considered edible and developing new methods of producing and consuming food in space.&#10;&#10;The reference to Moby Dick in the question suggests that understanding the role of 'belly-furniture' in historical events goes beyond mere survival; it also encompasses the human aspects of exploration, including morale, identity, and representation.

I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed&#10;some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:&#10;no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously&#10;respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more&#10;thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,&#10;had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,&#10;could I tell him where such a book was?&quot;&#10;&#10;I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader" />
    <node id="oor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it&#10;was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness&#10;without.&#10;&#10;The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and&#10;ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect&#10;trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.&#10;&#10;St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the&#10;house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the&#10;commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed&#10;to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the&#10;progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,&#10;he asked, &quot;If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?&quot;  I answered&#10;by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of&#10;my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the&#10;house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered&#10;upstairs" />

The event of the&#10;day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the&#10;accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of&#10;reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the&#10;very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap&#10;was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that &quot;a poor&#10;lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his&#10;mother, who was drawing away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where does she live, Hannah?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all&#10;the way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him" />

You have introduced a topic on&#10;which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the&#10;very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were&#10;required, what should we do?  How should we feel?

    <node id=" ensuing week tried his patience.  It was&#10;Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort&#10;of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of&#10;home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some&#10;life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon&#10;till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,&#10;original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and&#10;sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our&#10;vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish&#10;was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in&#10;visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.&#10;&#10;One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some&#10;minutes, asked him, &quot;If his plans were yet unchanged.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Unchanged and unchangeable,&quot; was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform&#10;us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the&#10;ensuing year.&#10;&#10;&quot;And Rosam" />
    <node id=" The narrative suggests that the letters written by the narrator to Mrs. Fairfax about Mr. Rochester's present residence and state of health did not reach her, as she never received any reply despite waiting for several months. However, the narrative does not provide a clear explanation for this occurrence. It could be possible that Mrs. Fairfax did not receive the letters due to some error in the postal service or she may have been unable to respond for personal reasons. The exact reason is left unexplained in the narrative and remains open to interpretation by the reader." />
    <node id=" when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.&#10;&#10;In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the&#10;will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present&#10;residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was&#10;quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,&#10;entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty&#10;on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early&#10;answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when&#10;two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought&#10;nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.&#10;&#10;I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&#10;Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some&#10;weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached&#10;me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died" />
    <node id=" elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to&#10;aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to&#10;mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give&#10;to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his&#10;own.&#10;&#10;Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late&#10;it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my&#10;heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.&#10;&#10;Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these&#10;changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with&#10;me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a&#10;sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a&#10;tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to&#10;know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom" />

But I feel mine is&#10;not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?&#10;He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,&#10;in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very&#10;plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty&#10;land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that&#10;ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so&#10;absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some&#10;impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of&#10;course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to&#10;replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the&#10;most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not," />

And he proceeded to inform&#10;us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the&#10;ensuing year.&#10;&#10;&quot;And Rosamond Oliver?&quot; suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her&#10;lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a&#10;gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it&#10;was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rosamond Oliver,&quot; said he, &quot;is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of&#10;the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir&#10;to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father&#10;yesterday.&quot;&#10;&#10;His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:&#10;he was serene as glass.&#10;&#10;&quot;The match must have been got up hastily,&quot; said Diana: &quot;they cannot have&#10;known each other long.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.

    <node id=": he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began&#10;to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.&#10;The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its&#10;peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after&#10;what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor&#10;approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,&#10;still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I&#10;comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that&#10;it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by&#10;inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him&#10;that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should&#10;despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he&#10;should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever&#10;conducting" />
    <node id=" Mr. Rochester's statement &quot;the battle is fought and the victory won&quot; refers to him having resolved some internal conflict or made an important decision. In the context of their relationship, it likely means that he has come to terms with the fact that Jane will not marry him due to his being already married, and has decided to move on. He expresses relief and gratitude for this resolution.&#10;&#10;Jane Eyre should interpret this statement as a sign that Mr. Rochester has accepted the reality of their situation and is making peace with it. This could be seen as a positive development in their relationship, as it suggests that Mr. Rochester is no longer trying to manipulate Jane into marrying him under false pretenses. However, it also highlights the distance between them, as Mr. Rochester has become more distant and frigid towards Jane since she rejected his proposal. This change in his behavior may make Jane question whether a relationship with him is still possible or desirable." />

When I remembered how far I had once been&#10;admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present&#10;frigidity.&#10;&#10;Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his&#10;head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--&#10;&#10;&quot;You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.&quot;&#10;&#10;Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a&#10;moment's hesitation I answered--&#10;&#10;&quot;But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose&#10;triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be&#10;called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is&#10;decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!&quot;  So saying, he&#10;returned to his papers and his silence.&#10;&#10;As our mutual happiness (_i.e._" />

However, St. John, the visitor, did not express any pleasure or enthusiasm about the improvements.

It was then nine o'clock: he did not&#10;return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked&#10;happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an&#10;exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms&#10;with himself.&#10;&#10;I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.

    <node id=" In the narrative provided, Heathcliff insists that he and Catherine cannot continue their relationship as adopted siblings because practical obstacles oppose any other plan. He argues that if they were real siblings, it would be acceptable for them to be together without marriage. However, since they are not related by blood, their union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage in order for them to be together. This is because society would not accept them traveling or living together as an unmarried couple, especially in a foreign country like India.

I thought Diana very provoking, and felt&#10;uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.&#10;John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his&#10;eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.

The&#10;bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over&#10;the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my&#10;eyes filled again.&#10;&#10;St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice&#10;failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of&#10;the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was&#10;gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My&#10;companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me&#10;as to its cause; he only said--&#10;&#10;&quot;We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.&quot;  And&#10;while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,&#10;leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye&#10;" />
    <node id=" Based on the text, St. John's plans for leaving England are definitively fixed for the following year. He mentions that he has already arranged everything and that his departure is certain. Therefore, it is unlikely that his plans will change anytime soon.

Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go&#10;to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between&#10;leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I&#10;know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to&#10;satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the&#10;finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If&#10;I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it&#10;absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire&#10;victim.

    <node id=" St. John chose Jane as his Hindostanee language study partner because he saw that she could sit at a task the longest out of himself, Diana, and Mary. He wanted a pupil with whom he could regularly go over the elements of the language to help fix them thoroughly in his mind, as he was studying Hindostanee himself and found that he tended to forget the commencement as he advanced. Jane's ability to focus on a task for longer periods of time made her a suitable choice in St. John's eyes.&#10;&#10;When Diana and Mary returned home, they were surprised to find that their brother had transferred Jane from being Diana's scholar to being his own. They found it amusing that St. John had been able to persuade them to make this change, as they would not have agreed to it themselves. Despite their initial surprise, however, they seemed to take the change in stride and continued with their usual habits and studies.&#10;&#10;In summary, St. John chose Jane as his language study partner because he saw her ability to focus on a task for longer periods of time, and Diana and Mary reacted to this change by finding it amusing that St. John had been able to persuade them to make the switch." />
    <node id=" I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget&#10;the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with&#10;whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them&#10;thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between&#10;me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could&#10;sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I&#10;should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now&#10;barely three months to his departure.&#10;&#10;St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every&#10;impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and&#10;permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found&#10;her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both&#10;she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to&#10;such a step.

While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of&#10;encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I&#10;fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some&#10;Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his&#10;plans.&#10;&#10;Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed&#10;enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-&#10;looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his&#10;fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it&#10;would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly&#10;to our table.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative, the person, who is identified as St. John, did not seem pleased with the improvements made to his home because he did not express any pleasure or enthusiasm during the tour.

After the tour, he showed more interest in reading a book than in engaging with Diana and Mary, who had just returned home.&#10;&#10;From his behavior after the tour, it can be inferred that St. John values knowledge and intellectual pursuits over emotional expression and physical comfort. He is a self-disciplined and focused individual who is able to control his emotions, as evidenced by his calm and commanding demeanor. His preference for reading a book rather than appreciating the efforts made to improve his living space further suggests that he values intellectual pursuits over emotional or physical comfort.&#10;&#10;In summary, St. John did not seem pleased with the improvements made to his home because he is more interested in intellectual pursuits than in emotional expression or physical comfort.

Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return&#10;the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new&#10;carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique&#10;ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and&#10;dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked&#10;fresh without being glaring.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative, St. John's demeanor while reading a letter from Miss Oliver suggests that he is a self-controlled and unemotional person. He remains &quot;serene as glass&quot; even when hearing about his former love's engagement to another man. This lack of emotional reaction may be indicative of his ability to detach himself from personal feelings and focus on his goals, which could be seen as a positive trait in some contexts. However, it also suggests that he may have difficulty expressing or understanding emotions, which could make him a challenging partner in a romantic relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's calm and commanding demeanor throughout the narrative, as well as his preference for intellectual pursuits over emotional expression or physical comfort, suggest that he values reason and logic over emotion. This may be reflected in his approach to marriage, which he sees as a means to an end (spreading Christianity) rather than a source of personal fulfillment or happiness.&#10;&#10;Overall, while St. John's personality traits, such as self-control and focus, may make him a successful missionary, they do not necessarily make him an ideal husband. His inability to express or understand emotions could create barriers in a romantic relationship, and his single-minded pursuit of his goals may leave little room for compromise or flexibility in married life." />
    <node id=" Based on the text provided, Jane Eyre has decided that she will not marry St. John Rivers and go with him to India as his missionary wife, despite knowing that by fulfilling his expectations she would abandon part of herself and face premature death in India.

However, St. John, who arrived first, did not express any pleasure or enthusiasm about the improvements.

    <node id="&#10;&#10;It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general&#10;holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the&#10;parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as&#10;well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely&#10;received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the&#10;sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic&#10;scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:&#10;they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my&#10;gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated&#10;hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I&#10;did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty&#10;girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in&#10;my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen&#10;of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed&#10;young women as could be found" />

And&#10;that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the&#10;best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since&#10;those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them&#10;seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton&#10;girls.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?&quot;&#10;asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  &quot;Does not the consciousness of&#10;having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doubtless.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the&#10;task of regenerating your race be well spent?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said; &quot;but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own&#10;faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.

    <node id=" Jane Eyre agrees to accompany St. John Rivers as a fellow-missionary on the condition that she will make the sacrifice absolutely and throw all of herself on the altar, meaning that she will devote herself completely to the missionary work. She is willing to do this because she believes it is a glorious occupation and the best way to fill the void left by her lost affections and shattered hopes. However, she finds the idea of being St. John's wife &quot;unendurable&quot; for several reasons.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane believes that their natures are fundamentally at variance when it comes to love. She sees their relationship as one of comradeship rather than romantic love and views his idea of love as counterfeit or insincere. Therefore, she rejects his offer of marriage and advises him to abandon his plan to marry her.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane is committed to being true to herself and her feelings, even if it means going against the expectations of others. By marrying St. John, she would be abandoning half of herself and facing premature death in India, which she finds unacceptable. She values her independence and autonomy too much to sacrifice them for a marriage that does not resonate with her genuine feelings.&#10;&#10;Lastly, St. John's demeanor and personality traits suggest that he may have difficulty expressing or understanding emotions, which could make him a challenging partner in a romantic relationship. His calm and commanding demeanor, preference for intellectual pursuits over emotional expression or physical comfort, and lack of emotional reaction to his former love's engagement to another man indicate that he values reason and logic over emotion. While these traits may make him a successful missionary, they do not necessarily make him an ideal husband, which is why Jane finds the alternative of being his wife &quot;unendurable.&quot;" />

She viewed his idea of love as counterfeit or insincere and rejected his offer, choosing to be true to herself and her feelings even if it went against the expectations of others.

    <node id=" In this narrative, Jane has been having a conversation with St. John about joining him in his missionary work and becoming his wife. She expresses her doubts about her qualifications for the task, stating that she is not fit for it and does not have a vocation. However, St. John insists that she is fit for the work, as she has the mental and personal endowments necessary to be a missionary's wife.&#10;&#10;Jane then says &quot;I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,&quot; but St. John is prepared for this objection and responds by saying that humility is the groundwork of Christian virtues, and that no one who has been truly called believes themselves worthy of the summons. He goes on to explain that he shudders at the thought of leaving his home and going to India, but that he feels it is the most glorious work a man can adopt or God can assign.&#10;&#10;Towards the end of the narrative, St. John asks Jane if she is in earnest when she says she will serve her heart to God, and Jane responds by saying &quot;I am not fit for it: I have no vocation.&quot; This statement is made with a hint of sarcasm, as she has already told St. John that she will give her heart to God but that he does not want it.&#10;&#10;In this narrative, the character of Jane expresses that she doesn't feel qualified or fit for the task and missionary work, despite St. John insisting she is. However, it is important to note that in the end, Jane will make her decision based on her own feelings and beliefs, not just because St. John thinks she should do it. She will weigh the pros and cons, and ultimately decide what is best for her. It is a reminder that everyone has their own path, and we must follow our hearts and listen to our inner voice when making big decisions in life." />

You will see what impetus would be given to&#10;your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the&#10;only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the&#10;destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor&#10;caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple&#10;about the degree, kind," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the man, who is identified as St. John Rivers, did not express any pleasure or appreciation for the changes made to his house because he values knowledge and intellectual pursuits over emotional expression and physical comfort. This preference is demonstrated by his calm and commanding demeanor, as well as his ability to control his emotions. Instead of appreciating the efforts made to improve his living space, St. John seemed more interested in reading a book and focusing on minor details, making Jane feel dismissed and dampening her spirits. His behavior after the tour further suggests that he is a self-disciplined and focused individual who prioritizes intellectual pursuits over emotional or physical comfort. Therefore, his lack of appreciation for the changes made to his house is not a criticism of Jane's efforts but rather a reflection of his personal values and priorities." />
    <node id=" The &quot;experiment kiss&quot; experienced by the narrator had a significant impact on their relationship with the person who kissed them. The narrator describes the kiss as not being passionate or emotional, but rather a calculated action to observe the reaction of the narrator. This is evident when the narrator states that the person viewing them &quot;to learn the result&quot; and that it was given &quot;with gravity and quiescence.&quot;&#10;&#10;The narrator's response to the kiss was also significant, as they felt as if it were a seal affixed to their fetters, indicating a sense of obligation or restriction. Despite this, the narrator wished daily to please the person who kissed them, but felt that they had to disown half their nature and stifle half their faculties in order to do so. This suggests that the person who kissed the narrator had a strong influence over them and that the narrator felt pressure to conform to their expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the &quot;experiment kiss&quot; served as a symbol of the power dynamic between the two characters and the impact that this had on the narrator's sense of self. It also highlights the calculated and detached nature of the person who kissed the narrator, suggesting that they may view relationships as transactions rather than emotional connections." />

There are no such&#10;things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical&#10;cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be&#10;experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed&#10;me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;&#10;perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss&#10;were a seal affixed to my fetters.

    <node id=" In the narrative, St. John is depicted as standing near Jane while gazing upon a rugged and wild mountain landscape. He appears to be in communion with the spirit of the place, and he expresses a sense of farewell as he looks at it. When he says that he will see the landscape again in his dreams and in a more remote hour, St. John is likely expressing a feeling of nostalgia or longing for the familiarity of his homeland. This reflects his thoughts about his future, as he is preparing to leave England for a missionary journey in India. The wildness of the landscape may also symbolize the challenges and obstacles that he anticipates facing on his journey. Overall, St. John's experience at the rugged landscape suggests a complex mix of emotions, including nostalgia, determination, and apprehension about the future." />

He looked up the pass and down&#10;the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to&#10;traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let&#10;the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with&#10;the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.&#10;&#10;&quot;And I shall see it again,&quot; he said aloud, &quot;in dreams when I sleep by the&#10;Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber over" />
    <node id="1. The female protagonist, Jane Eyre, agrees to accompany St. John Rivers as a fellow-missionary to India on the condition that she will make the sacrifice absolutely and devote herself completely to the missionary work. She sees this as a glorious occupation and the best way to fill the void left by her lost affections and shattered hopes.&#10;2. St. John insists that Jane must become &quot;a part of me&quot; in the form of marriage because he believes that practical obstacles oppose any other plan. He argues that if they were real siblings, it would be acceptable for them to be together without marriage. However, since they are not related by blood, their union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage in order for them to be together, especially in a foreign country like India where society would not accept them traveling or living together as an unmarried couple. Heathcliff insists on this because he wants to continue his relationship with Catherine, despite the fact that they do not love each other as man and wife should." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Mr. Rochester does not directly express his views on what role God intends for Jane Eyre to fulfill as a missionary's wife. However, it is clear that he believes that Jane cannot refuse this calling based on her own perceived unworthiness or lack of vocation.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester subscribes to the idea that humility is the foundation of Christian virtues and that no one who has been truly called feels worthy of the summons. He believes that practical obstacles, such as societal norms in a foreign country like India, necessitate a marital relationship between Jane and St. John rather than mere companionship.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Mr. Rochester would likely argue that it is God's intention for Jane to fulfill the role of a missionary's wife by accompanying St. John to India and serving as his helpmeet and fellow-laborer, regardless of her own perceived unworthiness or lack of vocation. He would likely believe that she cannot refuse this calling because it is a divine summons that requires humility and acceptance, rather than personal qualifications or feelings." />
    <node id=" Jane's deep disappointment on the day in question was not explicitly stated in the text to be due to the contents of the letter she received. However, it can be inferred that the letter brought her some degree of hope or excitement, as she mentions being &quot;cheered&quot; by it.&#10;&#10;Despite this initial boost, Jane found herself struggling to focus on her Hindostanee studies with St. John. The reason for her difficulty becomes clear when St. John reveals that he has chosen her as his language study partner specifically because of her ability to focus on a task for longer periods of time. This pressure to perform and meet St. John's expectations, coupled with the fact that she had already been studying German and now had to switch to Hindostanee, likely contributed to Jane's feelings of disappointment and frustration.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's lack of enthusiasm or appreciation for the efforts made to improve his living space may have added to Jane's sense of deflation on this particular day. His calm and commanding demeanor, while perhaps admirable in some respects, may have come across as dismissive or ungrateful, further contributing to Jane's feelings of disappointment.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the specific contents of the letter Jane received are not mentioned, it is clear that she was initially cheered by it before experiencing a wave of disappointment and frustration as she struggled to focus on her Hindostanee studies with St. John. His lack of enthusiasm for the improvements made in his living space and his demanding expectations may have also contributed to Jane's feelings of disappointment on this particular day." />

    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, Heathcliff and Catherine have determined that in order to continue their relationship and be together, they must get married. This is because practical obstacles, such as societal norms and expectations in a foreign country like India, oppose any other plan. Although they are not related by blood, Heathcliff argues that their union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage in order for them to be together without facing judgment or criticism from society. Despite the fact that they may not love each other as a traditional married couple should, they believe this is the only way for them to continue their relationship." />
    <node id="1. Mr. Northanger (St. John Rivers) seems eager because Jane has expressed her desire to be active and make arrangements for Diana and Mary's return. He understands that she is not planning on going on an excursion but instead wants to prepare the cottage for her cousins.&#10;2. Mr. Northanger's plans now include setting Hannah free from her duties at Moor House so she can assist Jane in preparing the cottage for Diana and Mary. This shows that he recognizes the importance of this event and is willing to support Jane's efforts.&#10;3. Additionally, Mr. Northanger intends to have Hannah ready by the next day, indicating that he understands the urgency of the situation and wants to ensure everything is in order before his sisters arrive. By doing so, he demonstrates his thoughtfulness and consideration for their comfort and well-being." />
    <node id=" St. John Rivers is trying to convey to Jane that if she devotes herself completely to serving God and advancing His kingdom on earth, it will bring her the greatest joy and fulfillment. He believes that by fixing her heart on her Maker, she will be able to let go of her human attachments and fully commit herself to the missionary work they would do together in India. Essentially, he is trying to convince Jane that this is the path to true happiness and purpose in life. However, Jane interprets his words differently and feels that St. John's idea of love and relationship is not genuine or sincere, leading her to decline his proposal and stay true to herself." />
    <node id=" In preparation for Diana and Mary's return to Moor House, Jane made several changes to create a pleasantly novel atmosphere. She was given carte blanche to make any alterations she pleased and was provided with a sum of money for this purpose. Jane left the ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms mostly as they were, knowing that her cousins would appreciate seeing the familiar homely furnishings. However, she introduced some new elements to give a fresh feel without being overly glaring.&#10;&#10;Jane refurnished a spare parlour and bedroom entirely with old mahogany and crimson upholstery. She also took care of practical aspects by laying canvas on the passage and carpets on the stairs. The result was a complete model of bright modest snugness, making Moor House an inviting and comfortable place for Diana and Mary to return to after their time away." />
    <node id=" St. John hopes that once the initial excitement of preparing for her sisters' arrival subsides, Jane will turn her attention to serving God and advancing His kingdom on earth through missionary work with him in India. He believes that by fixing her heart on her Maker, she will be able to let go of her human attachments and find true happiness and purpose in life. However, Jane interprets his words differently and feels that St. John's idea of love and relationship is not genuine or sincere. She sees their relationship as one of comradeship rather than romantic love and views his idea of love as counterfeit or insincere. Therefore, she rejects his offer and advises him to abandon his plan to marry her. Jane makes it clear that she will not marry St. John and go with him to India, despite knowing that by fulfilling his expectations she would abandon part of herself and face premature death in India. She will make her decision based on her own feelings and beliefs, not just because St. John thinks she should do it." />

The narrator describes the kiss as not being passionate or emotional, but rather a calculated action to observe the reaction of the narrator. This is evident when the narrator states that the person viewing them &quot;to learn the result&quot; and that it was given &quot;with gravity and quiescence.&quot;&#10;&#10;The narrator's response to the kiss was also significant, as they felt as if it were a seal affixed to their fetters, indicating a sense of obligation or restriction. Despite this, the narrator wished daily to please the person who kissed them, but felt that they had to disown half their nature and stifle half their faculties in order to do so. This suggests that the person who kissed the narrator had a strong influence over them and that the narrator felt pressure to conform to their expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the &quot;experiment kiss&quot; served as a symbol of the power dynamic between the two characters and the impact that this had on the narrator's sense of self. It also highlights the calculated and detached nature of the person who kissed the narrator, suggesting that they may view relationships as transactions rather than emotional connections.">

She was given carte blanche to make any alterations she pleased and was provided with a sum of money for this purpose. Jane left the ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms mostly as they were, knowing that her cousins would appreciate seeing the familiar homely furnishings. However, she introduced some new elements to give a fresh feel without being overly glaring.&#10;&#10;Jane refurnished a spare parlour and bedroom entirely with old mahogany and crimson upholstery. She also took care of practical aspects by laying canvas on the passage and carpets on the stairs. The result was a complete model of bright modest snugness, making Moor House an inviting and comfortable place for Diana and Mary to return to after their time away.">

This could be seen as a positive development in their relationship, as it suggests that Mr. Rochester is no longer trying to manipulate Jane into marrying him under false pretenses. However, it also highlights the distance between them, as Mr. Rochester has become more distant and frigid towards Jane since she rejected his proposal.

In the&#10;very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap&#10;was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that &quot;a poor&#10;lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his&#10;mother, who was drawing away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where does she live, Hannah?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all&#10;the way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him" target="1. Mr. Northanger (St. John Rivers) seems eager because Jane has expressed her desire to be active and make arrangements for Diana and Mary's return. He understands that she is not planning on going on an excursion but instead wants to prepare the cottage for her cousins.&#10;2. Mr. Northanger's plans now include setting Hannah free from her duties at Moor House so she can assist Jane in preparing the cottage for Diana and Mary. This shows that he recognizes the importance of this event and is willing to support Jane's efforts.&#10;3. Additionally, Mr. Northanger intends to have Hannah ready by the next day, indicating that he understands the urgency of the situation and wants to ensure everything is in order before his sisters arrive. By doing so, he demonstrates his thoughtfulness and consideration for their comfort and well-being.">

He remains &quot;serene as glass&quot; even when hearing about his former love's engagement to another man. This lack of emotional reaction may be indicative of his ability to detach himself from personal feelings and focus on his goals, which could be seen as a positive trait in some contexts. However, it also suggests that he may have difficulty expressing or understanding emotions, which could make him a challenging partner in a romantic relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's calm and commanding demeanor throughout the narrative, as well as his preference for intellectual pursuits over emotional expression or physical comfort, suggest that he values reason and logic over emotion. This may be reflected in his approach to marriage, which he sees as a means to an end (spreading Christianity) rather than a source of personal fulfillment or happiness.&#10;&#10;Overall, while St. John's personality traits, such as self-control and focus, may make him a successful missionary, they do not necessarily make him an ideal husband. His inability to express or understand emotions could create barriers in a romantic relationship, and his single-minded pursuit of his goals may leave little room for compromise or flexibility in married life.">

Therefore, she rejects his offer and advises him to abandon his plan to marry her.

He wanted a pupil with whom he could regularly go over the elements of the language to help fix them thoroughly in his mind, as he was studying Hindostanee himself and found that he tended to forget the commencement as he advanced. Jane's ability to focus on a task for longer periods of time made her a suitable choice in St. John's eyes.&#10;&#10;When Diana and Mary returned home, they were surprised to find that their brother had transferred Jane from being Diana's scholar to being his own.

He remains &quot;serene as glass&quot; even when hearing about his former love's engagement to another man. This lack of emotional reaction may be indicative of his ability to detach himself from personal feelings and focus on his goals, which could be seen as a positive trait in some contexts. However, it also suggests that he may have difficulty expressing or understanding emotions, which could make him a challenging partner in a romantic relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's calm and commanding demeanor throughout the narrative, as well as his preference for intellectual pursuits over emotional expression or physical comfort, suggest that he values reason and logic over emotion.

His inability to express or understand emotions could create barriers in a romantic relationship, and his single-minded pursuit of his goals may leave little room for compromise or flexibility in married life.">

He remains &quot;serene as glass&quot; even when hearing about his former love's engagement to another man. This lack of emotional reaction may be indicative of his ability to detach himself from personal feelings and focus on his goals, which could be seen as a positive trait in some contexts. However, it also suggests that he may have difficulty expressing or understanding emotions, which could make him a challenging partner in a romantic relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's calm and commanding demeanor throughout the narrative, as well as his preference for intellectual pursuits over emotional expression or physical comfort, suggest that he values reason and logic over emotion. This may be reflected in his approach to marriage, which he sees as a means to an end (spreading Christianity) rather than a source of personal fulfillment or happiness.&#10;&#10;Overall, while St. John's personality traits, such as self-control and focus, may make him a successful missionary, they do not necessarily make him an ideal husband. His inability to express or understand emotions could create barriers in a romantic relationship, and his single-minded pursuit of his goals may leave little room for compromise or flexibility in married life.">

    <edge source=" Based on the text provided, Jane Eyre has decided that she will not marry St. John Rivers and go with him to India as his missionary wife, despite knowing that by fulfilling his expectations she would abandon part of herself and face premature death in India. This decision is made clear when Jane tells St. John &quot;I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us continue&quot; and later on, after much contemplation, she refuses his proposal by saying &quot;Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer&quot; with the response &quot;Oh, St. John! I cried, 'have some mercy!'&quot; which indicates that she has declined his offer." target="&#09;St. John proposed to Jane that she accompany him to India as his missionary wife, helping him in his religious work. However, Jane was unable to accept this proposal because she felt their natures were fundamentally at variance when it came to the topic of love, and she saw their relationship as one of comradeship rather than romantic love. She viewed his idea of love as counterfeit or insincere and rejected his offer, choosing to be true to herself and her feelings even if it went against the expectations of others. Additionally, accepting St. John's proposal would have required Jane to abandon part of herself and face premature death in India, which she was not willing to do.">

She sees this as a glorious occupation and the best way to fill the void left by her lost affections and shattered hopes.&#10;2. St. John insists that Jane must become &quot;a part of me&quot; in the form of marriage because he believes that practical obstacles oppose any other plan. He argues that if they were real siblings, it would be acceptable for them to be together without marriage. However, since they are not related by blood, their union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage in order for them to be together, especially in a foreign country like India where society would not accept them traveling or living together as an unmarried couple. Heathcliff insists on this because he wants to continue his relationship with Catherine, despite the fact that they do not love each other as man and wife should.">

His calm and commanding demeanor, preference for intellectual pursuits over emotional expression or physical comfort, and lack of emotional reaction to his former love's engagement to another man indicate that he values reason and logic over emotion.

The reason for her difficulty becomes clear when St. John reveals that he has chosen her as his language study partner specifically because of her ability to focus on a task for longer periods of time. This pressure to perform and meet St. John's expectations, coupled with the fact that she had already been studying German and now had to switch to Hindostanee, likely contributed to Jane's feelings of disappointment and frustration.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's lack of enthusiasm or appreciation for the efforts made to improve his living space may have added to Jane's sense of deflation on this particular day.

The reason for her difficulty becomes clear when St. John reveals that he has chosen her as his language study partner specifically because of her ability to focus on a task for longer periods of time. This pressure to perform and meet St. John's expectations, coupled with the fact that she had already been studying German and now had to switch to Hindostanee, likely contributed to Jane's feelings of disappointment and frustration.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's lack of enthusiasm or appreciation for the efforts made to improve his living space may have added to Jane's sense of deflation on this particular day.

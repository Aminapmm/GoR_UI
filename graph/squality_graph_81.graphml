    <node id="Based on the story provided, Mury, Ryd Randl, and their captive became trapped in an impenetrable crypt of niosteel after the inner lock failed to open when the outer gangway was closed. This occurred when Ryd accidentally dropped his gun while stumbling over the pressure rings, causing the guardsman to hurl himself forward and triggering Mury to close the outer gangway and shut the inner lock. The flame gun fired by Mury also created a scorched spot on the metal of the opposite lock. They were trapped in this niosteel crypt with no means of escape or communication, as Mury had melted into the shadow to open a small, disused metal door using an electron torch. It is unclear what happened to them next or how they managed to get out of their situation." />
    <node id="enetrable crypt of niosteel.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Mury smiled with supernal calm. &quot;We won't be here long,&quot; he said. Then, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: &quot;The central control panel and the three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are on the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the switch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central control panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.&quot;&#10; &#10; Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch he had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets. Ryd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as he slipped cat-like into the passage.&#10; &#10; &quot;Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd backed—the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own nervous gaze—and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal pressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering somewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.&#10; &#10; He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward;" />
    <node id=" civic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the ancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both hands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway—for he was still very sick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.&#10; &#10; Above, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved wall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable countersunk mirror of metal.&#10; &#10; &quot;Cover him, Ryd,&quot; ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out the heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously tremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his fears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on the side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.&#10; &#10; Nothing happened.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!&quot; The outer gangway had slid up, the lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Mury smiled with supernal calm. &quot;We won't be here" />
    <node id=" his unsure grip, clattering somewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.&#10; &#10; He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning, back against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled to keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a crouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing lever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch outside.&#10; &#10; The inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant, the flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a scorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite lock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.&#10; &#10; &quot;You damned clumsy little fool—&quot; said Mury with soft intensity. Then, while the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with blue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two quick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the starboard airlock.&#10; &#10; Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash &quot;" />
    <node id=" the runways beyond the long, low buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship would also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.&#10; &#10; Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light scraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands and face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light. He had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a small, disused metal door.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save for the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It seemed to be crying: run, run —but he remembered the power that knew how to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.&#10; &#10; The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside, and Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The same automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the air-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the long-stale atmosphere. Mury" />
    <node id=" &quot; He paused out of breath; then finished venomously, &quot;Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper than robots—cheap as slaves !&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What about it?&quot; gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. &quot;What you want me to do about it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was once more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. &quot;We're going to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,&#10;&quot;What's that mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The power shell—isn't coming in as planned.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't do that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; We can,&quot; said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. &quot;And there are fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?&quot;&#10; &#10; Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing certainly—if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by this man or another of his kind. For the secret" />
    <node id="ate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever happened....&#10; &#10; After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and whined, &quot;Where ... where we going now?&quot;&#10; &#10; Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the gray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he pointed as Ryd had known he would—toward where a pale man-made dawn seemed breaking over Pi Mesa.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; &quot;One blow for freedom!&quot; said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell upon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had killed the guard.&#10; &#10; The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky moon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to drop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the long, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and servicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a little stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now. He was caught in" />

Burshis implies that this will mean jobs for everyone in the city, &quot;even for you,&quot; suggesting that he knows Ryd has been out of work and struggling. Burshis likely hopes that by buying Ryd a drink, he can help improve his mood and offer him some encouragement. However, it's unclear whether Burshis expects anything specific in return for the free drink - he simply tells Ryd &quot;No loans. But just one on the house, Ryd&quot; before turning to serve another customer." />
    <node id=" it away. He drank still more deeply.&#10; &#10; The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on his arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: &quot;So you're Ryd Randl.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Ryd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any plain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody he had ever known—an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a beak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for the thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the face, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and almost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray cellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.&#10; &#10; &quot;Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the idea?&quot; demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage floated to the top by alcohol.&#10; &#10; The other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself. He leaned back" />

If anyone recognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something else. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with surprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.&#10; &#10; Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer and maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was heartened.&#10; &#10; &quot;Say, Burshis,&quot; he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his back to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so that his jowls quivered.&#10; &#10; &quot;No loans,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;But just one on the house, Ryd.&quot;&#10; &#10; The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it convulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, &quot;What you setting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since—&quot;&#10; &#10; Burshis' smile" />
    <node id=" the high, thin air.&#10; &#10; &quot;So you're Ryd Randl,&quot; repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.&#10;&quot;I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. &quot;Look,&quot; he gasped. &quot;If you're a cop, say so!&quot;&#10; &#10; The other laughed shortly. &quot;No. I'm just a man about to offer you a chance. For a come-back, Ryd—a chance to live again.... My name—you can call me Mury.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the tall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with his first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And why, Ryd?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.&quot; He hunched his narrow shoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. &quot;Damn" />
    <node id=" said suspiciously, &quot;What you setting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since—&quot;&#10; &#10; Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, &quot;Didn't you hear that ship that just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars—the escort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming in again.&quot; He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his shoulder: &quot;You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again. Jobs for all the bums in this town—even for you.&quot;&#10; &#10; He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear his head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again, huh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio man—no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit of working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and then took it away. He drank still more deeply.&#10; &#10; The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on his arm," />
    <node id=" his small store of natural courage floated to the top by alcohol.&#10; &#10; The other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself. He leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and distinctly. &quot;Would you care to make some money, my friend?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Huh? Why, yeh—I guess so—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then come with me.&quot; The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his daze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish crowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made frantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger fumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out, past the blue-and-gold-lit meloderge that was softly pouring out its endlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.&#10; &#10; Outside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on them. They kept walking—so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath, long-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.&#10; &#10; &quot;So you're Ryd Randl,&quot; repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.&#10;&quot;I might have" />
    <node id=" or so overhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the almost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing darkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming minnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi Mesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted up—draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining them gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819, relief was in sight.&#10; &#10; Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to shuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis' dive.&#10; &#10; The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were asleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis' which were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen, these days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For Dynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had been built to be the power center of North America.&#10; &#10; The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wed" />

His companion wheeled on the topmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face, but with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes?&quot; he inquired frostily.&#10; &#10; &quot;What goes on here?&quot; snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure silhouetted against the glow in the airlock. &quot;The crew's signaled all aboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,&quot; interrupted the tall man with asperity. &quot;The City is naturally interested in the delivery of the power which will revivify our industries.&quot; He paused, sighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. &quot;I suppose you'll want to re-check" />
    <node id="liess?&quot;&#10; &#10; The astrogator broke his silence. &quot;A ship.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know that well enough. What ship?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that that's the liner Alborak , out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission for Mars.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mury shook his head regretfully. &quot;That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you suppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that drive.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know what you're talking about,&quot; said Arliess. But his voice was raw and unsteady.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for us—will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!&quot;" />
    <node id=". They aren't your police with built-in weapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For God's sake, take it easy.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd licked dry lips. &quot;Are we going—out into space?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where else?&quot; said Mury.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat had reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought to question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed guardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards from the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was—as it came about—just a little too late.&#10; &#10; The guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving pair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing uneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle in sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between the solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other in perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the Shahrazad's airlocks from more distant view; the gang of" />
    <node id=" flame gun thundered again in the starboard airlock.&#10; &#10; Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash &quot;Ready&quot; to the Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But the latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped in their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in an instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned guardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his little cell of steel.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's been tried before,&quot; said one of the masked men. He had a blond, youthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with an astrogator's triangled stars which made him ex officio the brains of the vessel. &quot;Stealing a ship—it can't be done any more.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's been done again,&quot; said Mury grimly. &quot;And you don't know the half of it. But—you will. I'll need you. As for your friends—&quot; The gun muzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. &quot;Out of those clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.&quot;" />
    <node id=" He ventured shakily, &quot;Where are we?&quot;&#10; &#10; Mury smiled slightly. &quot;Only our astrogator,&quot; he indicated Arliess, still masked and fettered, &quot;can tell you that with precision. I understand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he is holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he is an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of duty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of the Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?&quot;&#10; &#10; The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him through his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights burned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous tracks.&#10; &#10; Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly, he inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame seemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of light.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's that, Arliess?&quot;&#10; &#10; The astrogator broke his silence. &quot;A ship.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know that well enough. What ship?&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; And indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching for all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once inside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough. Nonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last, inconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.&#10; &#10; Not far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the midst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies, their principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two officers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet. Blue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance—watched boredly enough.&#10; &#10; And out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number Two Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive magnets—the Shahrazad , panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of steam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out of Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be sounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now" />
    <node id="The story does not provide specific details about the reasons behind the helio operator's failure to adapt to Mars. However, it is mentioned that he was a foreman ten years ago and that he &quot;doesn't have the physique for Mars.&quot; It is also stated that after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its full economic independence and domination, which might have made it difficult for human workers to find employment on the planet. The Power Company of North America plant outside the military bases in the Kun Lun closed down in December 809, but the story does not provide information about the circumstances surrounding its closure. It is possible that the closing of the plant was related to the economic difficulties faced by human workers on Mars and the dominance of robot labor." />
    <node id="...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.&quot; He hunched his narrow shoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. &quot;Damn good one, too—I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the physique for Mars—I might just have made it then , but I thought the plant was going to open again and—&quot;&#10; &#10; And that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning actinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine. And after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its full economic independence—and domination. For power is—power; and there is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two in ten could live healthily on the outer world.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ten years ago,&quot; Mury nodded as if satisfied. &quot;That must have been the Power Company of North America—the main plant by Dynamopolis itself, that shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down outside the military bases in the Kun Lun.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in this strange man; for too long" />
    <node id=", Ryd—you mean nothing at all to me as an individual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am working—the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and sold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after they've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered their hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to be refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor capitulate frankly to him.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such ideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. &quot;Are you talking about the power cylinder?&quot; he demanded blurrily.&#10; &#10; Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian cargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said simply, &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't get it,&quot; mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had heard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: &quot;The power cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in the arm—no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in" />
    <node id="The power cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in the arm—no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis. It will turn the wheels and light the cities and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To hell with that!&quot; snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up slightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. &quot;Don't you know you're repeating damnable lies?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a passion shocking after his smooth calm:&#10; &#10; &quot;The power shell is aid, yes—but with what a price! It's the thirty pieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have sold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and vision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable conflict, they're selling us out—making Earth, the first home of man, a colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great Martian land-owners? Do you? &quot; He paused out of breath; then finished venomously, &quot;Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper than robots—cheap as" />
    <node id="1. Ryd follows Mury's instructions and trades clothes with the dead guard, as he is frightened for his life and realizes he has nothing to lose.&#10;2. He does this to continue on their journey, most likely to complete their mission of doing something about the exploitation of Earth's labor force by those in power.&#10;3. Ryd also tries to placate Mury and assure him that he is on the same side, as he is now more deeply involved in the situation and wants to avoid further conflict or danger." />
    <node id=" at the dead huddle at his feet, a little stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now. He was caught in the machinery.&#10; &#10; Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing the weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short wrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown the aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State order had grounded all fliers in America.&#10; &#10; &quot;All right, Ryd,&quot; he said coolly. &quot;Trade clothes with this fellow. I've brought you this far—you're taking me the rest of the way.&quot;&#10; &#10; The rest of the way.&#10; &#10; Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous exertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the guarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air, shook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's uniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as he clumsily buckled" />
    <node id=" he knew one thing certainly—if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by this man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as We never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing, desperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and panclasm—that was We .&#10; &#10; The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with an effort, said, &quot;Sure.&quot; A moment later it struck him that the monosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, &quot;I got nothing to lose, see?&quot; It was, he realized, the cold truth.&#10; &#10; &quot;You won't lose,&quot; said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with which he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they had come.&#10; &#10; Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his volition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to placate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever happened....&#10; &#10; After some steps he stole a sidelong glance" />
    <node id="In the story, Mury takes extreme measures to steal the spaceship Alborak and ensure that it stays on course to meet the power shell. He forces the pilot, engineer, and astrogator to go to the portside airlock using a flame gun. When the burly engineer resists, Mury threatens him with the gun and orders him to comply.&#10;&#09;Mury is particularly interested in astrogator Yet Arliess, as he needs his knowledge of astrogational practice to navigate the ship accurately. However, Arliess initially refuses to cooperate with Mury's plan to steal the ship. To persuade him, Mury points a flame gun at Arliess and asks if he wants to make the trip alive. Faced with this threat, Arliess eventually agrees to cooperate.&#10;&#09;Mury's extreme measures have a significant impact on the crew of the Alborak, causing fear and intimidation.

A handful of odd ships—mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had berthed—huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by the chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.&#10; &#10; As the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of protective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport. Surely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed buildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must mean safety for them.&#10; &#10; And indeed no guard challenged them.

A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control cupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film of dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of the disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal door marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway down which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and launched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait,&quot; said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his long legs taking two steps at a time.

In the control room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect hum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning gyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the engines.&#10; &#10; Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.&#10;&quot;You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,&quot; he said dryly. &quot;That doesn't mean you,&quot; to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in the pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved hands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the sloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.&#10; &#10; Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his head groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He ventured shakily, &quot;Where are we?&quot;&#10; &#10; Mury smiled slightly. &quot;Only our astrogator,&quot; he indicated Arliess," />

Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed him; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces and lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and up, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities—and Ryd had lost every sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under the towship's keel.&#10; &#10; A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the control panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights confused with the stars coldly through the great nose window.

However, since Arliess initially resisted Mury's plan, the character Semul Mury states that only the astrogator can tell their precise location, and Mury himself only understands enough of astrogational practice to ensure Arliess is holding to the course outlined on the log." />
    <node id="The power cylinder is not truly the salvation of Earth's industry as it is presented, but rather a means for Mars to exploit Earth and its labor force.

    <node id="At the Communications Tower, Ryd and his companions have successfully infiltrated the area, appearing to be authorized due to Ryd's borrowed blue uniform.

Another guard attempts to stop them at the topmost step of the gangway, but Mury introduces himself as the Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis, claiming interest in the delivery of power that will revitalize their industries.&#10;&#10;The situation involves a tense standoff with Ryd and Mury trying to board the Shahrazad while guards and officials are present but distracted by the imminent departure of the ship.

We'll be aboard the Shahrazad when she lifts.&quot; For a moment his black eyes shifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there beyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with blind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters. It had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving again very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding its crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and immobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.&#10; &#10; &quot;Robots!&quot; gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.&#10;&quot;Martian soldier robots!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They're unarmed, harmless.

He knew enough of weapons to recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol, powerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong fingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into the sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.&#10; &#10; &quot;No use now for firearms,&quot; said Mury. &quot;All the guns we could carry wouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a stage property for the little play we're going to give in about three minutes—when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of Dynamopolis, aboard the towship Shahrazad .&quot;&#10; &#10; For a moment Ryd felt relief—he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred of Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage the Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long, low buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship would also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold" />

Faced with this threat, Arliess agrees to cooperate.&#10;3. The power shell is a cylinder containing power that will benefit Earth's industry, but Mury believes it will exploit Earth's labor force and turn it into a colony of Mars. He thinks the rulers lack the courage to retool Earth's plants and factories for the upcoming conflict and have sold out Earth.&#10;4.

He does this while Ryd stands guard, and both of them are in suspense about the lock mechanism and the potential consequences of their actions.&#10;2. The reason for this action is not explicitly stated in the story, but it can be inferred that they are trying to find a way out of their current situation, where they are trapped in an impenetrable crypt of niosteel after the inner lock failed to open.&#10;3. Mury's plan, as he explains to Ryd, is to cut out the central control panel and use the three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks to open the inner lock. This plan works, and the inner lock swing silently free of its gaskets, allowing them to escape.&#10;4. The reason for breaking into a disused metal door is not explicitly stated in the story, but it can be inferred that they are looking for an alternative way out or a place to hide until they can find a solution to their current situation." />
    <node id="Based on Mury's observations from the turret-windows, the terminal facilities of the spaceport appear to be abandoned and not in use. He notes that there is a layer of dust on the stairway leading up to the control cupola, and the long runway used for servicing, refueling, and launching ships is also dormant. This suggests that the spaceport has been out of operation for some time, and is no longer being used for its original purpose." />

The Martian sky's favorability for the helio-dynamic engine: The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning actinic rays, is highly conducive to the use of the helio-dynamic engine. This is because such an engine would rely on solar energy, which is abundant and intense on Mars due to its thin atmosphere and lack of cloud cover.&#10;&#10;2. Impact of robot labor on Mars' economy: After the middle of the eighth century, robot labor became prevalent on Mars, giving it full economic independence and domination. This shift towards automation might have made it difficult for human workers to find employment on the planet, as indicated by the former foreman being unable to adapt to Mars and having to return to Earth. The dominance of robot labor could have contributed to the closing down of the Power Company of North America plant outside the military bases in the Kun Lun, which might have been unable to compete with automated Martian industries.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of the Restriction Act: The Restriction Act is a measure that keeps men on Earth even if more than two in ten could live healthily on the outer world. This act is crucial in understanding Mars' relationship with Earth, as it prevents mass migration to Mars and helps maintain Earth's labor force for industries connected to the power cylinder. The power cylinder, while appearing to benefit Earth, actually exploits its labor force and turns Earth into a de facto colony of Mars, with corrupt governments selling out their own people in exchange for economic gain. Mury recognizes this exploitation and takes extreme measures to protect the interests of Earth's working class, believing that cooperation is necessary for survival." />

The &quot;official-looking individual&quot; in expensive attire boarding their spaceship without proper authorization is actually Ryd himself, after he trades clothes with the dead guard and impersonates a guardsman.

    <node id="1. The scarlet figures near the Martian warship are Martian soldier robots. They are unarmed and harmless, but their presence contributes to the tense atmosphere in the story. However, they do not play a direct role in the situation that Ryd and his companion, Semul Mury, are facing.&#10;2. The main challenge for Ryd and Mury is boarding the space-bound towship Shahrazad without being detected or challenged by the guards and officials present. The Martian warship and its robot soldiers do not pose a direct threat to them at this point because the robots are unarmed and the warship is immobile due to Earth's weight.&#10;3. Ryd and Mury's mission, as far as we know, is not specifically about the exploitation of Earth's labor force by those in power. While Mury does mention that their actions will benefit Dynamopolis, he does not provide specific details about what those actions are or how they will achieve this goal.&#10;4. Ryd follows Mury's instructions and impersonates a guardsman to board the Shahrazad unquestioned.

The use of force also serves to intimidate and control the situation, allowing Mury and Ryd to proceed with their plans without interruption or challenge. Additionally, by taking the guard's gun, Mury ensures that they have a weapon on board, which may be useful in case of unexpected confrontations or obstacles.&#10;3. It is also possible that Mury does not trust the bureaucracy and officials of the ninth-century society, and therefore chooses to take matters into his own hands rather than relying on official channels.

This is orchestrated by corrupt governments who lack the courage and vision to retool Earth's factories for the inevitable conflict with Mars, instead choosing to sell out their own people.

The Circumstances Surrounding the Closure: The story implies that the Power Company of North America plant closed down in December 809, which coincides with the time when robot labor became prevalent on Mars and human workers faced difficulties finding employment. The former foreman, who is now out of work, suggests that he had hoped the plant would reopen, but it did not happen.

The power shell is presented as a means of benefiting Earth's industry, but it actually allows Mars to tap into Earth's industries and use its population as a source of cheap labor, making Earth dependent on Mars for its economic survival. This situation is similar to colonialism, where a more powerful entity exploits a less powerful one for its own gain.&#10;5. Mury recognizes this exploitation and takes extreme measures to protect the interests of Earth's working class, believing that cooperation with his plan is necessary for survival. He sees the power shell as a trap set by Mars to sell out humanity and undermine Earth's independence and sovereignty.">

This coincides with the larger picture of Mars exploiting Earth through the Restriction Act and the power cylinder, which might have contributed to the closing of the plant as well.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the story does not provide specific details about the circumstances behind the closure of the Power Company of North America plant outside the military bases in the Kun Lun, it suggests that the shift towards automation and the dominance of robot labor on Mars might have made it difficult for human workers to find employment on the planet, leading to the closure of the plant. The larger picture of Mars exploiting Earth through the Restriction Act and the power cylinder might have also contributed to the closing of the plant.">

Additionally, by taking the guard's gun, Mury ensures that they have a weapon on board, which may be useful in case of unexpected confrontations or obstacles.&#10;3.

The Martian sky's favorability for the helio-dynamic engine: The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning actinic rays, is highly conducive to the use of the helio-dynamic engine. This is because such an engine would rely on solar energy, which is abundant and intense on Mars due to its thin atmosphere and lack of cloud cover.&#10;&#10;2. Impact of robot labor on Mars' economy: After the middle of the eighth century, robot labor became prevalent on Mars, giving it full economic independence and domination. This shift towards automation might have made it difficult for human workers to find employment on the planet, as indicated by the former foreman being unable to adapt to Mars and having to return to Earth. The dominance of robot labor could have contributed to the closing down of the Power Company of North America plant outside the military bases in the Kun Lun, which might have been unable to compete with automated Martian industries.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of the Restriction Act: The Restriction Act is a measure that keeps men on Earth even if more than two in ten could live healthily on the outer world. This act is crucial in understanding Mars' relationship with Earth, as it prevents mass migration to Mars and helps maintain Earth's labor force for industries connected to the power cylinder. The power cylinder, while appearing to benefit Earth, actually exploits its labor force and turns Earth into a de facto colony of Mars, with corrupt governments selling out their own people in exchange for economic gain. Mury recognizes this exploitation and takes extreme measures to protect the interests of Earth's working class, believing that cooperation is necessary for survival.">

This restoration of power is expected to bring jobs back to the city, &quot;even for [Ryd].&quot; Burshis likely hopes that by buying Ryd a drink, he can help improve his mood and offer him some encouragement. However, it's unclear whether Burshis expects anything specific in return for the free drink - he simply tells Ryd &quot;No loans. But just one on the house, Ryd&quot; before turning to serve another customer. It's possible that Burshis is offering the drink out of kindness and a desire to help his fellow city-dweller, rather than expecting anything in return." target="Burshis offers Ryd a free drink to celebrate the arrival of a new power cylinder from Mars, which will restore power to Dynamopolis after a long shortage.

Burshis may have refused to give Ryd loans in the past because he did not want to enable Ryd's unemployment or create a cycle of debt, but still wants to show support for him during this time of potential change and opportunity in Dynamopolis.">

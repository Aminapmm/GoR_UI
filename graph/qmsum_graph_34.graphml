    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the specific desires of people regarding TV remotes that were revealed in the study include:&#10;&#10;1. People think remotes are ugly - 75% of the subjects had this opinion.&#10;2. Eighty percent of the subjects said they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote.&#10;&#10;The desire for a remote with a better appearance was found to be significant, with a majority of the subjects expressing their willingness to pay more for such a product. The exact definition of &quot;fancy&quot; was not specified in the transcript, but it can be interpreted as a remote that looks more modern, sleek, or stylish.&#10;&#10;This information influenced the team's approach to designing the remote by emphasizing the importance of creating a visually appealing product that users would be willing to pay more for. It is also worth noting that this desire was consistent across different age groups, as voice recognition was found to be more desirable among younger people but not necessarily correlated with the willingness to pay more.&#10;&#10;In summary, the study revealed that a significant majority of people find current TV remotes unattractive and would prefer a fancier-looking remote, even if it comes at a higher cost. This desire for a better appearance was found to be an important factor influencing users' willingness to pay more for a remote." />
    <node id=" how to play this . No .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Press the little presentation . It's the um {disfmarker} it looks like a Y_ kind of {disfmarker} over there above Draw . There , that one , there you go .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly {vocalsound} , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they {disfmarker} more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also" />
    <node id="Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R" />
    <node id="'s in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm 'kay , thank you .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay , great .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Here we go . Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh ," />
    <node id=" a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and different different people sort of prefer different things . Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out" />
    <node id=" decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . So {disfmarker} First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the {gap} functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {gap} Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Sure , please do .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I dunno . How do I hook my screen up ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I think , you might have to disconnect Rose .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes I do . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Where does it go ? Mm-hmm . Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this ,&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So I had a look on the {disfmarker} on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things {disfmarker} what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of" />
    <node id="1. Target Group: The target group for this product is individuals aged between 15 to 35 years old. However, the transcript does not provide more specific information about the demographics or characteristics of this group.&#10;2. Factors Influencing Component Quality, including Battery and Chip:&#10;&#10;a. User Control and Data Conversion: The chip is crucial as it converts data for user control. The quality of the chip affects how well the device functions and presents data to the user.&#10;&#10;b. Component Quality: All components must be of high quality, as any shoddy work will become visible over time. This includes the battery and the chip.&#10;&#10;c. Battery Usage and Design: There is some debate in the transcript about whether a battery is necessary or not. If a battery is included, it should ideally have a long life to ensure ease of use and simplicity for the user. One suggestion is to incorporate a charging station similar to mobile phones or iPods.&#10;&#10;d. Technological Considerations: The project manager mentions that integrating a battery into the design might affect the chip's ability to transmit information, indicating that technological constraints could impact component choices and quality.&#10;&#10;e. Aesthetics and Functionality: The device should be fashionable and unobtrusive when placed on a coffee table or similar spaces, emphasizing simplicity and fashion in the design process.&#10;&#10;f. User Interface: The user interface must be intuitive and straightforward, controlling the chip and converting data for the user's benefit." />
    <node id=" to do with battery , but that's just my {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: The battery and that {disfmarker} I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So 's just the quality of the chip .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . I think so .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: The quality {vocalsound} uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything {disfmarker} shoddy work , 'cause it's&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: gonna be visible down the line .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: S" />
    <node id=" into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip {disfmarker} ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um yeah use that thing {gap} you can go back , previous .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Previous . Sorry about that , guys .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Pardon .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;" />
    <node id="Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . I suspect the remote control does need a battery ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , I would imagine .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: but I dunno if you can {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: It {disfmarker} I think it does . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , without the energy , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You could" />
    <node id="Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um , yeah , hidden way . And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {gap} on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Alright .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Battery battery use . Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But we might as well .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So you never have to change the battery .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .

    <node id="1. Keeping it from getting lost: The project manager mentions the need for a function or feature that prevents the item (presumably a product they are designing) from getting lost. This could be an anti-loss feature like a tracker, an alert system, or a storage solution.&#10;2. Large and accessible buttons for essential functions: The project manager emphasizes the importance of having large and easily accessible buttons for essential functions to ensure user-friendliness.&#10;3. Extra functions: The team wants to include extra functions that can be hidden or made less prominent than the main features, allowing users to access them if needed without cluttering the primary interface.&#10;4. Fashionable design: While not explicitly mentioned by the project manager, they bring up the need for the product to be fashionable and visually appealing. This implies a function related to aesthetics or customization.&#10;5. Battery life: The team briefly discusses battery-related functions, such as long-life batteries or possibly eliminating the need for a battery altogether. This is tied to simplicity, ease of use, and environmental considerations.&#10;&#10;These are the functions that the project manager raises in the conversation, which they aim to define further within the remaining four minutes of the meeting." />

    <node id="1. Essential Functions: The team is considering several essential functions for this project, including an anti-loss feature like a tracker or alert system, large and easily accessible buttons for primary functions, extra features that can be hidden or made less prominent, and a focus on aesthetics and customization to make the product fashionable.&#10;   &#10;2. Power Options: The team has discussed various power options for the device. There is some debate about whether a battery is necessary or not. If included, they prefer a long-life battery that aligns with simplicity and ease of use. They are also considering eliminating the need for batteries altogether by investigating alternatives, such as a charging station similar to mobile phones or iPods. The choice of power options may be influenced by technological constraints and user interface considerations.&#10;&#10;The discussion about battery life and the willingness to pay more for a better-looking remote control were driven by user feedback, with 75% of people finding current TV remotes unattractive and 80% expressing their willingness to pay more for a fancier looking remote. This information emphasized the importance of creating a visually appealing product that users would be willing to pay more for, without necessarily requiring advanced technology or additional features. The team aims to focus on simplicity and user-friendliness, rather than just technological advancements." />
    <node id=" aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: That's a good thing to keep in mind .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: in fact it could use {disfmarker} it could mean , not . If {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?

Well , we can look for {disfmarker} we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , simplification .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Simplification ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: They could have a crap remote&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, it appears that the Project Manager inadvertently included a second design from an earlier project in the shared folder. They mention that they didn't put it there and comment that it might be from an earlier project. The other team members do not indicate any awareness or intention of including this extra design in the group folder. Therefore, it is likely that this inclusion was unintentional and should be removed to avoid confusion." />

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, people's dislike for RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) is related to the repetitive use of certain buttons on the remote control. This strain can cause discomfort or pain over time, affecting the user experience negatively. The problem of remotes not matching users' operating behavior is characterized by people only using a small percentage of the available buttons, with most users focusing on changing channels and adjusting volume.&#10;&#10;RSI is particularly relevant to this issue because one of the main frustrations mentioned by people during the study was the difficulty in learning how to use remotes and having too many buttons. This can lead to repetitive usage of specific buttons while ignoring others, increasing the risk of RSI and reducing overall user satisfaction. By addressing RSI concerns, the team can focus on designing a more user-friendly remote control that better matches users' behavior and offers essential functions without overwhelming them with unnecessary buttons or features." />

So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So" />
    <node id="1. The management has decided not to collaborate with a particular entity or individual, although the specific details of this decision are not provided in the transcript.&#10;2. The new design focus for television will prioritize simplicity and speed in order to release the product quickly.&#10;3. The remote control will have an emphasis on aesthetics and customization to make it fashionable, as a significant majority of people find current TV remotes unattractive and are willing to pay more for a fancier-looking remote.&#10;4. The team is considering several essential functions for the project, including an anti-loss feature, large and easily accessible buttons for primary functions, extra features that can be hidden or made less prominent, and a focus on aesthetics and customization.&#10;5. There has been discussion about various power options for the device, such as long-life batteries or alternatives like a charging station similar to mobile phones or iPods. The choice of power options may be influenced by technological constraints and user interface considerations." />

Power options: The team is discussing various power options, including long-life batteries and charging stations, to ensure a simple and user-friendly experience. The choice will depend on technological constraints and user interface considerations.&#10;4. Anti-loss feature: The project manager mentioned the need for a function or feature that prevents the remote from getting lost, such as a tracker or alert system.&#10;5. User feedback: The team is taking into account user feedback, which indicates that people dislike RSI caused by repetitive button usage and prefer simplicity over advanced technology or unnecessary features. This information has influenced the design focus on simplicity, speed, and user-friendliness." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the extra design file from an earlier project added by the Project Manager is located in the shared folder. The Industrial Designer has access to three things in their shared folder: technical functions presentation, working design presentation, and functional requirements. However, they only see three items, while the Project Manager sees one additional item which is the extra design file. It is not explicitly mentioned how to identify the extra file, but it can be identified by the fact that it belongs to an earlier project, as stated by the Project Manager." />

    <node id="1. Essential Functions: The team is considering several essential functions for this project, including an anti-loss feature like a tracker or alert system, large and easily accessible buttons for primary functions, extra features that can be hidden or made less prominent, and a focus on aesthetics and customization to make the product fashionable.&#10;&#10;2. Power Options: The team is discussing various power options for the device, such as long-life batteries or alternatives like a charging station similar to mobile phones or iPods. There has been some debate about whether a battery is necessary or not, with considerations being given to technological constraints and user interface implications if a battery is included. The choice of power options may be influenced by these factors." />
    <node id="The main concern brought up in the conversation regarding a feature they are developing is the need for an anti-loss function to prevent the item (presumably a product they are designing) from getting lost. This could be achieved through a tracker or alert system. The goal is to ensure that users don't misplace the product and can easily locate it when needed." />
    <node id="Teletext is a British technology from the 1980s that allowed for the display of text and simple graphics on televisions. It was used to display information such as news headlines, lottery numbers, sports scores, and what was on TV next. The reason it's being brought up in the context of new requirements is because they are no longer going to support this feature since teletext has been replaced by the internet. This is likely because the internet can provide similar information in a more updated and accessible way." />

    <node id="1. Lack of necessity: The project manager mentions that voice recognition might not be necessary for a remote control, as it is more essential for the TV itself. They argue that using a remote should primarily involve direct manipulation rather than vocal commands.&#10;2. User preference and experience: The marketing team questions the need for voice recognition in a remote control, suggesting that users prefer simplicity and ease of use in their remotes. Adding voice recognition could complicate the user interface and detract from the desired simplicity.&#10;3. Potential additional costs: The industrial designer and project manager express concerns about the potential expense of incorporating voice recognition technology into the remote control. This cost may outweigh the benefits, particularly if users are unwilling to pay more for this feature or if it is not considered essential by the target market." />

    <node id="1. Energy Source (Battery or other): This component provides the necessary power for the system to function. It could be a battery or another form of energy source. The energy source delivers energy or information to the chip, which is controlled by the user.&#10;&#10;2. Chip: The chip is responsible for converting data and user control in the system. Its quality significantly affects how well the device functions and presents data to the user. The chip receives energy from the power source and transmits information via an infra-red (IR) bulb to the receiver.&#10;&#10;3. User Interface: This component is what the user interacts with to control the system. It must be intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to manage the chip and convert data for their benefit. The user interface works in conjunction with the chip to ensure proper functioning of the device.&#10;&#10;4. Infra-Red (IR) Bulb: This component facilitates data transmission from the chip to the receiver. It is responsible for moving the data to the receiver, enabling communication between different parts of the system.&#10;&#10;These four main components interact with each other as follows: The energy source provides power to the chip, which converts data and user control. The user interacts with the interface to manage the chip, and the IR bulb transmits information from the chip to the receiver, enabling communication between different parts of the system." />
    <node id="1. Voice Recognition Preference: The user research revealed that the desire for voice recognition in a remote control was inversely related to age. Younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, while older individuals, particularly those aged 60 and above, did not think they would pay more money for this feature.&#10;&#10;2. Common Frustrations: Some common frustrations mentioned by people during the study included losing remotes (over 50% of people cited this as their biggest frustration) and the difficulty in learning how to use a remote. This ties back to the issue of having too many buttons, which can overwhelm users and contribute to Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs).&#10;&#10;3. RSIs: RSIs are a result of repetitive usage of specific buttons on the remote while ignoring others, increasing the risk of discomfort or pain over time. This reduces overall user satisfaction and is particularly relevant to this issue because one of the main frustrations was the difficulty in learning how to use remotes and having too many buttons.&#10;&#10;These findings have influenced the team's approach to designing the remote control by considering simplicity, ease of use, and addressing common frustrations such as RSIs, losing remotes, and the difficulty in learning how to use them. Additionally, the team has taken into account the varying preferences for voice recognition based on age." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, working designers determine the necessary elements and conversions for an apparatus to fulfill its intended practical function by breaking down all the points at which something needs to happen. They create a schematic of the way energy is converted toward this practical function. This process is similar to how a coffee grinder works, converting electrical energy into grinding beans, filtering them, and producing hot coffee as an end result. By identifying each step required for the apparatus to fulfill its function, designers can figure out what needs to be done and how to convert all the elements to make it work properly." />
    <node id=" yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the {disfmarker} what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but {disfmarker} how do I get to the next s ah . So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen .

    <node id="1. Clear Purpose: By designing various prototypes of the user interface, the team can evaluate which version best communicates the product's primary function and purpose to users. This iterative process ensures that the end result is intuitive and easy for users to understand.&#10;&#10;2. Understandable Functionality: Through user feedback on the prototypes, the team can determine if the interface effectively conveys how the product works and what its key features are. The focus on a conventional design helps maintain familiarity for users while introducing novel ideas can enhance usability and differentiate the product from competitors.&#10;&#10;3. Appealing Features: Creating visually appealing and customizable designs addresses users' desire for fashionable products that they would be willing to pay more for. Additionally, incorporating user feedback about simplicity and ease of use ensures that the final design will meet end-users' expectations by prioritizing essential functions and large, easily accessible buttons." />
    <node id="1. Color Scheme and Concept: The new design's color scheme will primarily involve yellow, as mentioned by the industrial designer. The team wants to create a product that looks good and incorporates their corporate image, which is described as &quot;kind of yellow colour with um we put fashion in electronics&quot; (User Interface). This suggests that the concept for the corporate image combines a bold, attention-grabbing color like yellow with an emphasis on making electronic products more fashionable.&#10;&#10;2. Incorporating Fashion in Electronics: The team has agreed to prioritize simplicity and fashion in their design (Project Manager, User Interface, Marketing). By focusing on these aspects, they aim to create a visually appealing and customizable product that users would be willing to pay more for due to its aesthetically pleasing design. The emphasis on fashion also means introducing novel ideas while maintaining familiarity in the user interface, ensuring the final design stands out from competitors while still being easy to understand and use." />

    <node id="1. Components Concept: The Industrial Designer should continue working on developing the components concept for the product, taking into consideration the new requirements mentioned by the Project Manager during the meeting.&#10;&#10;2. Target Demographic: While designing the product, the Industrial Designer should keep in mind the target demographic, which includes individuals under 6" />
    <node id="The issue with saving a file, as mentioned in the conversation, stems from the fact that an extra design file from an earlier project was added to the shared folder by the Project Manager. This unintentionally created confusion for the team members, as they did not recognize this file and it was not meant to be included in their current project.&#10;&#10;Marketing suggested saving the file to the shared folder, but realized that she couldn't save it there due to its read-only nature or because it didn't belong to their current project scope. The Project Manager acknowledged the issue and stated that they would figure it out.&#10;&#10;To resolve this issue, the Project Manager needs to remove the extra design file from the shared folder, as mentioned in their action items for the meeting. This will help avoid confusion and ensure team members can easily access and save relevant files related to their current project." />
    <node id="The extra design file from the previous project added by the Project Manager is located within the shared folder. However, it does not appear in the lists of the Industrial Designer and Marketing team members, which only include 'technical functions presentation,' 'working design presentation,' and 'functional requirements.'&#10;&#10;To address this issue, the Project Manager should remove the extra file from the shared folder to avoid confusion. Once removed, the Industrial Designer or Marketing can save their relevant files to the group folder, ensuring that only the correct files are available for others to access. If there is a read-only restriction on the group folder, they may need to resolve this issue by changing permissions or saving the file elsewhere, as mentioned by the Project Manager during the meeting." />
    <node id="1. Psychographics: This includes attitudes, values, interests, and lifestyle preferences of the target audience. Understanding these aspects can help in designing a product that aligns with their personality and needs. For example, if the target group consists of young adults aged between 15 to 35 years old who value sustainability and eco-friendly products, incorporating environmentally friendly materials and features into the design would be beneficial.&#10;&#10;2. Buying behavior: Analyzing how the target group makes purchasing decisions can influence marketing strategies and product positioning. Factors such as brand loyalty, impulsiveness, or careful consideration before buying should be taken into account to tailor communication and sales approaches effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Geographic location: The physical location of the target audience can impact their needs and preferences. For instance, urban dwellers might prioritize compact and portable designs, while those living in rural areas may prefer products with longer battery life due to limited access to charging stations.&#10;&#10;4. Cultural background: Considering cultural differences can help avoid misunderstandings or insensitive design choices. It is essential to be aware of any cultural nuances related to colors, symbols, or functional requirements that could affect the product's acceptance among different demographic groups.&#10;&#10;5. Technology adoption rate: Understanding the target group's comfort level with technology can guide decisions on incorporating advanced features or keeping the design simple and user-friendly. For example, if the target demographic is not very tech-savvy, focusing on ease of use and clear instructions would be crucial.&#10;&#10;6. Family situation: Considering factors such as whether the target group consists mainly of singles, couples, or families can help tailor the product's features and benefits to better suit their specific needs. For instance, a product designed for families might prioritize safety and durability features more than one aimed at single professionals.&#10;&#10;Taking these demographic factors into account is important because they provide a more comprehensive understanding of the target audience, allowing for the creation of products that not only meet their age and income-related needs but also resonate with their values, lifestyle, and preferences. This leads to increased customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and overall business success." />
    <node id="The team is considering technological advancement, such as voice recognition, for the remote primarily because of the marketing team's curiosity about what else can be added to make it technologically advanced. However, there are concerns about the potential complexity and additional costs associated with incorporating voice recognition technology. The project manager also mentions that voice recognition might not be necessary for a remote control, as it is more essential for the TV itself.&#10;&#10;To make the remote attractive for purchase while keeping the cost at or below twelve and a half Euros, the team can focus on other features that users would find valuable. Based on user feedback, a significant majority of people find current TV remotes unattractive (75%), and 80% express their willingness to pay more for a fancier-looking remote. Thus, investing in aesthetics and customization can be an essential factor in making the product fashionable and appealing to users.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the team is considering several essential functions for the project, including:&#10;1. An anti-loss feature like a tracker or alert system&#10;2. Large and easily accessible buttons for primary functions&#10;3. Extra features that can be hidden or made less prominent&#10;4. A focus on aesthetics and customization to make the product fashionable&#10;&#10;The power options discussion revolves around simplicity, ease of use, technological constraints, and user interface considerations. The team is weighing the pros and cons of various power sources, such as long-life batteries or alternatives like a charging station similar to mobile phones or iPods. Ultimately, the choice of power options will depend on factors such as cost, usability, and compatibility with the remote's design and features." />
    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer suggests disconnecting the current device (Rose) to hook up the screen.&#10;2. The User Interface speaker then guides the process by mentioning a &quot;wee plug&quot; that should be connected. However, there seems to be some confusion about where this plug goes.&#10;3. The Marketing speaker expresses uncertainty about moving certain components and asks for further clarification on the process.&#10;&#10;It is not explicitly stated if the screen was successfully connected during the meeting. Therefore, the exact order and specific steps to connect the screen to the remote control system remain unclear based on the provided transcript." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the team is discussing the feasibility of including voice recognition within the price limit of around twelve to twelve and a half Euros. The primary concern with adding voice recognition is the potential increase in costs, which may already be allocated for other essential features and design aspects. Additionally, there might be compromises required in other areas of the product to accommodate voice recognition within the specified price range.&#10;&#10;Marketing research indicates that the desire for voice recognition is inversely related to age, with younger people more inclined to want it and older people (sixty and above) less interested. This information can be considered when determining the target market and their preferences.&#10;&#10;Considering the limited budget and potential additional costs associated with voice recognition, as well as the mixed demand for this feature among different age groups, it might not be feasible to include voice recognition without significantly increasing the product's cost. Instead, the team could focus on other valuable features that align with user preferences and the project's budget constraints, such as an anti-loss function, large and easily accessible buttons, extra features, and aesthetics/customization." />

It is important for the team to ensure clear communication regarding their decisions and reasons, especially when it involves external parties.&#10;&#10;2. The specific focus of the project in terms of media and time constraint is to prioritize simplicity and speed in designing a television. This will help release the product quickly, addressing market needs and staying competitive.&#10;&#10;3. To ensure brand recognition, the team aims to maintain consistent color and slogan usage in the new design. As discussed, the primary color for the new design's color scheme is yellow, reflecting their corporate image of combining a bold color with an emphasis on making electronic products more fashionable. Additionally, incorporating fashion into electronics means introducing novel ideas while maintaining familiarity in the user interface to stand out from competitors and still be easy to understand and use." />
    <node id="Yes, based on the transcript, there is an extra design file from a previous project inadvertently included by the Project Manager in the shared folder. This file does not appear in the lists of the Industrial Designer and Marketing team members, who only see 'technical functions presentation,' 'working design presentation,' and 'functional requirements.' The Project Manager should remove this extra file from the shared folder to avoid confusion and ensure that only the correct files are available for others to access." />
    <node id="1. Identify necessary elements and conversions: Working designers determine the required components and energy transformations for an apparatus to fulfill its intended practical function by breaking down all the points at which something needs to happen. They create a schematic of how energy is converted toward this practical function, similar to how a coffee grinder works.&#10;2. Break down conversion steps: Industrial designers focus on breaking down all the steps involved in converting energy into the desired outcome. In the case of a coffee grinder, electrical energy is converted into grinding beans, filtered, and then combined with other elements to produce hot coffee.&#10;3. Consider additional requirements: While working on the design concept for the product, industrial designers should take into account any new requirements mentioned by project managers during meetings. For example, there may be specific functional or aesthetic considerations that need to be incorporated into the design.&#10;4. Keep target demographic in mind: Industrial designers should always consider the target demographic while designing a product. In this case, they are designing for individuals under 6 years old, which will influence the size, shape, and overall safety of the coffee grinder.&#10;5. Create prototypes and gather user feedback: To ensure that the end result is intuitive and easy to understand, working designers create various prototypes of the user interface to test with users. User feedback helps determine if the interface effectively conveys how the product works and what its key features are while maintaining familiarity for users.&#10;6. Incorporate essential functions: The team considers several essential functions for this project, such as an anti-loss feature, large buttons for primary functions, hidden or less prominent extra features, a focus on aesthetics, and customization options to make the product fashionable.&#10;7. Determine power options: Discussions around power options include long-life batteries, charging stations similar to mobile phones, and iPods, as well as considerations for whether a battery is necessary or not. The choice of power options may be influenced by technological constraints and user interface implications." />

This strain can cause discomfort or pain over time, affecting the user experience negatively. The problem of remotes not matching users' operating behavior is characterized by people only using a small percentage of the available buttons, with most users focusing on changing channels and adjusting volume.&#10;&#10;RSI is particularly relevant to this issue because one of the main frustrations mentioned by people during the study was the difficulty in learning how to use remotes and having too many buttons. This can lead to repetitive usage of specific buttons while ignoring others, increasing the risk of RSI and reducing overall user satisfaction. By addressing RSI concerns, the team can focus on designing a more user-friendly remote control that better matches users' behavior and offers essential functions without overwhelming them with unnecessary buttons or features.">

Voice Recognition Preference: The user research revealed that the desire for voice recognition in a remote control was inversely related to age. Younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, while older individuals, particularly those aged 60 and above, did not think they would pay more money for this feature.&#10;&#10;2. Common Frustrations: Some common frustrations mentioned by people during the study included losing remotes (over 50% of people cited this as their biggest frustration) and the difficulty in learning how to use a remote. This ties back to the issue of having too many buttons, which can overwhelm users and contribute to Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs).&#10;&#10;3. RSIs: RSIs are a result of repetitive usage of specific buttons on the remote while ignoring others, increasing the risk of discomfort or pain over time. This reduces overall user satisfaction and is particularly relevant to this issue because one of the main frustrations was the difficulty in learning how to use remotes and having too many buttons.&#10;&#10;These findings have influenced the team's approach to designing the remote control by considering simplicity, ease of use, and addressing common frustrations such as RSIs, losing remotes, and the difficulty in learning how to use them.

They argue that using a remote should primarily involve direct manipulation rather than vocal commands.&#10;2.

Adding voice recognition could complicate the user interface and detract from the desired simplicity.&#10;3. Potential additional costs: The industrial designer and project manager express concerns about the potential expense of incorporating voice recognition technology into the remote control.

Voice Recognition Preference: The user research revealed that the desire for voice recognition in a remote control was inversely related to age. Younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, while older individuals, particularly those aged 60 and above, did not think they would pay more money for this feature.&#10;&#10;2. Common Frustrations: Some common frustrations mentioned by people during the study included losing remotes (over 50% of people cited this as their biggest frustration) and the difficulty in learning how to use a remote. This ties back to the issue of having too many buttons, which can overwhelm users and contribute to Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs).&#10;&#10;3. RSIs: RSIs are a result of repetitive usage of specific buttons on the remote while ignoring others, increasing the risk of discomfort or pain over time. This reduces overall user satisfaction and is particularly relevant to this issue because one of the main frustrations was the difficulty in learning how to use remotes and having too many buttons.&#10;&#10;These findings have influenced the team's approach to designing the remote control by considering simplicity, ease of use, and addressing common frustrations such as RSIs, losing remotes, and the difficulty in learning how to use them. Additionally, the team has taken into account the varying preferences for voice recognition based on age.">

Psychographics: This includes attitudes, values, interests, and lifestyle preferences of the target audience. Understanding these aspects can help in designing a product that aligns with their personality and needs. For example, if the target group consists of young adults aged between 15 to 35 years old who value sustainability and eco-friendly products, incorporating environmentally friendly materials and features into the design would be beneficial.&#10;&#10;2. Buying behavior: Analyzing how the target group makes purchasing decisions can influence marketing strategies and product positioning. Factors such as brand loyalty, impulsiveness, or careful consideration before buying should be taken into account to tailor communication and sales approaches effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Geographic location: The physical location of the target audience can impact their needs and preferences. For instance, urban dwellers might prioritize compact and portable designs, while those living in rural areas may prefer products with longer battery life due to limited access to charging stations.&#10;&#10;4. Cultural background: Considering cultural differences can help avoid misunderstandings or insensitive design choices. It is essential to be aware of any cultural nuances related to colors, symbols, or functional requirements that could affect the product's acceptance among different demographic groups.&#10;&#10;5. Technology adoption rate: Understanding the target group's comfort level with technology can guide decisions on incorporating advanced features or keeping the design simple and user-friendly. For example, if the target demographic is not very tech-savvy, focusing on ease of use and clear instructions would be crucial.&#10;&#10;6. Family situation: Considering factors such as whether the target group consists mainly of singles, couples, or families can help tailor the product's features and benefits to better suit their specific needs. For instance, a product designed for families might prioritize safety and durability features more than one aimed at single professionals.&#10;&#10;Taking these demographic factors into account is important because they provide a more comprehensive understanding of the target audience, allowing for the creation of products that not only meet their age and income-related needs but also resonate with their values, lifestyle, and preferences.

Younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, while older individuals, particularly those aged 60 and above, did not think they would pay more money for this feature.&#10;&#10;2. Common Frustrations: Some common frustrations mentioned by people during the study included losing remotes (over 50% of people cited this as their biggest frustration) and the difficulty in learning how to use a remote. This ties back to the issue of having too many buttons, which can overwhelm users and contribute to Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs).&#10;&#10;3. RSIs: RSIs are a result of repetitive usage of specific buttons on the remote while ignoring others, increasing the risk of discomfort or pain over time. This reduces overall user satisfaction and is particularly relevant to this issue because one of the main frustrations was the difficulty in learning how to use remotes and having too many buttons.&#10;&#10;These findings have influenced the team's approach to designing the remote control by considering simplicity, ease of use, and addressing common frustrations such as RSIs, losing remotes, and the difficulty in learning how to use them. Additionally, the team has taken into account the varying preferences for voice recognition based on age.">

Psychographics: This includes attitudes, values, interests, and lifestyle preferences of the target audience. Understanding these aspects can help in designing a product that aligns with their personality and needs. For example, if the target group consists of young adults aged between 15 to 35 years old who value sustainability and eco-friendly products, incorporating environmentally friendly materials and features into the design would be beneficial.&#10;&#10;2. Buying behavior: Analyzing how the target group makes purchasing decisions can influence marketing strategies and product positioning. Factors such as brand loyalty, impulsiveness, or careful consideration before buying should be taken into account to tailor communication and sales approaches effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Geographic location: The physical location of the target audience can impact their needs and preferences. For instance, urban dwellers might prioritize compact and portable designs, while those living in rural areas may prefer products with longer battery life due to limited access to charging stations.&#10;&#10;4. Cultural background: Considering cultural differences can help avoid misunderstandings or insensitive design choices. It is essential to be aware of any cultural nuances related to colors, symbols, or functional requirements that could affect the product's acceptance among different demographic groups.&#10;&#10;5. Technology adoption rate: Understanding the target group's comfort level with technology can guide decisions on incorporating advanced features or keeping the design simple and user-friendly. For example, if the target demographic is not very tech-savvy, focusing on ease of use and clear instructions would be crucial.&#10;&#10;6. Family situation: Considering factors such as whether the target group consists mainly of singles, couples, or families can help tailor the product's features and benefits to better suit their specific needs. For instance, a product designed for families might prioritize safety and durability features more than one aimed at single professionals.&#10;&#10;Taking these demographic factors into account is important because they provide a more comprehensive understanding of the target audience, allowing for the creation of products that not only meet their age and income-related needs but also resonate with their values, lifestyle, and preferences. This leads to increased customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and overall business success.">

Components Concept: The Industrial Designer should continue working on developing the components concept for the product, taking into consideration the new requirements mentioned by the Project Manager during the meeting.&#10;&#10;2. Target Demographic: While designing the product, the Industrial Designer should keep in mind the target demographic, which includes individuals under 6" target="1. Psychographics: This includes attitudes, values, interests, and lifestyle preferences of the target audience. Understanding these aspects can help in designing a product that aligns with their personality and needs. For example, if the target group consists of young adults aged between 15 to 35 years old who value sustainability and eco-friendly products, incorporating environmentally friendly materials and features into the design would be beneficial.&#10;&#10;2. Buying behavior: Analyzing how the target group makes purchasing decisions can influence marketing strategies and product positioning. Factors such as brand loyalty, impulsiveness, or careful consideration before buying should be taken into account to tailor communication and sales approaches effectively.&#10;&#10;3.

    <edge source="The team is considering technological advancement, such as voice recognition, for the remote primarily because of the marketing team's curiosity about what else can be added to make it technologically advanced. However, there are concerns about the potential complexity and additional costs associated with incorporating voice recognition technology. The project manager also mentions that voice recognition might not be necessary for a remote control, as it is more essential for the TV itself.&#10;&#10;To make the remote attractive for purchase while keeping the cost at or below twelve and a half Euros, the team can focus on other features that users would find valuable. Based on user feedback, a significant majority of people find current TV remotes unattractive (75%), and 80% express their willingness to pay more for a fancier-looking remote. Thus, investing in aesthetics and customization can be an essential factor in making the product fashionable and appealing to users.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the team is considering several essential functions for the project, including:&#10;1. An anti-loss feature like a tracker or alert system&#10;2. Large and easily accessible buttons for primary functions&#10;3. Extra features that can be hidden or made less prominent&#10;4. A focus on aesthetics and customization to make the product fashionable&#10;&#10;The power options discussion revolves around simplicity, ease of use, technological constraints, and user interface considerations. The team is weighing the pros and cons of various power sources, such as long-life batteries or alternatives like a charging station similar to mobile phones or iPods. Ultimately, the choice of power options will depend on factors such as cost, usability, and compatibility with the remote's design and features." target="Based on the transcript, the team is discussing the feasibility of including voice recognition within the price limit of around twelve to twelve and a half Euros. The primary concern with adding voice recognition is the potential increase in costs, which may already be allocated for other essential features and design aspects. Additionally, there might be compromises required in other areas of the product to accommodate voice recognition within the specified price range.&#10;&#10;Marketing research indicates that the desire for voice recognition is inversely related to age, with younger people more inclined to want it and older people (sixty and above) less interested. This information can be considered when determining the target market and their preferences.&#10;&#10;Considering the limited budget and potential additional costs associated with voice recognition, as well as the mixed demand for this feature among different age groups, it might not be feasible to include voice recognition without significantly increasing the product's cost. Instead, the team could focus on other valuable features that align with user preferences and the project's budget constraints, such as an anti-loss function, large and easily accessible buttons, extra features, and aesthetics/customization.">

    <node id="Carol's outburst about a hypothetical Frenchman reveals her frustration and desire for freedom from the societal expectations and proprieties of Gopher Prairie. She longs for adventure, passion, and intellectual stimulation that she feels is lacking in her current environment. The Frenchman, with his cynicism, love for opera, and bawdy stories, represents all the things that are repressed or discouraged in Gopher Prairie. By desiring a stranger to kiss her hand, Carol is expressing her dissatisfaction with the lack of romance and chivalry in her life and community. She is also pushing back against the conventional gender roles and expectations of her town." />

Not sure about the rest of it but I guess that's what you and all&#10;the other discontented young women really want: some stranger kissing&#10;your hand!&quot; At Carol's gasp, the old squirrel-like Vida darted out and&#10;cried, &quot;Oh, my dear, don't take that too seriously.

In&#10;that fog world of transference of emotion Vida had no normal jealousy&#10;but a conviction that, since through Carol she had received Kennicott's&#10;love, then Carol was a part of her, an astral self, a heightened and&#10;more beloved self. She was glad of the girl's charm, of the smooth black&#10;hair, the airy head and young shoulders. But she was suddenly angry.&#10;Carol glanced at her for a quarter-second, but looked past her, at an&#10;old roadside barn. If she had made the great sacrifice, at least she&#10;expected gratitude and recognition, Vida raged, while her conscious&#10;schoolroom mind fussily begged her to control this insanity.&#10;&#10;During her first call half of her wanted to welcome a fellow reader of&#10;books; the other half itched to find out whether Carol knew anything&#10;about Kennicott's former interest in herself. She discovered that Carol&#10;was not aware that he had ever touched another woman's hand. Carol was&#10;an" />

In her fluid thought certain convictions&#10;appeared, jaggedly, a fragment of an impression at a time, while she was&#10;going to sleep, or manicuring her nails, or waiting for Kennicott.&#10;&#10;These convictions she presented to Vida Sherwin--Vida&#10;Wutherspoon--beside a radiator, over a bowl of not very good walnuts and&#10;pecans from Uncle Whittier's grocery, on an evening when both Kennicott&#10;and Raymie had gone out of town with the other officers of the Ancient&#10;and Affiliated Order of Spartans, to inaugurate a new chapter at&#10;Wakamin. Vida had come to the house for the night. She helped in putting&#10;Hugh to bed, sputtering the while about his soft skin. Then they talked&#10;till midnight.&#10;&#10;What Carol said that evening, what she was passionately thinking, was&#10;also emerging in the minds of women in ten thousand Gopher Prairies.

No, she's adorable. . . .&#10;I don't think she ought to be so friendly with Guy Pollock.&quot;&#10;&#10;For a year Vida loved Carol, longed to and did not pry into the details&#10;of her relations with Kennicott, enjoyed her spirit of play as expressed&#10;in childish tea-parties, and, with the mystic bond between them&#10;forgotten, was healthily vexed by Carol's assumption that she was a&#10;sociological messiah come to save Gopher Prairie. This last facet of&#10;Vida's thought was the one which, after a year, was most often turned to&#10;the light. In" />

Their sons finished the&#10;process. In ready-made clothes and ready-made high-school phrases they&#10;sank into propriety, and the sound American customs had absorbed without&#10;one trace of pollution another alien invasion.&#10;&#10;And along with these foreigners, she felt herself being ironed into&#10;glossy mediocrity, and she rebelled, in fear.&#10;&#10;The respectability of the Gopher Prairies, said Carol, is reinforced by&#10;vows of poverty and chastity in the matter of knowledge. Except for&#10;half a dozen in each town the citizens are proud of that achievement&#10;of ignorance which it is so easy to come by.

    <node id="The repetition and similarity of physical structures, shops, and wares in Gopher Prairie, as described by Carol, highlights the absence of individuality and cultural diversity in the town. This uniformity is indicative of a &quot;philosophy of dull safety,&quot; where conformity is prioritized over personal expression or creativity. The lack of variety in buildings, shops, and even people's appearances demonstrates how the community suppresses uniqueness and difference, fostering an environment that stifles personal growth and development.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the fact that Kennicott could be transported to another town without realizing it emphasizes the pervasive sameness in American towns. This lack of distinctiveness between places implies a monotonous existence for their inhabitants, with little opportunity for exposure to diverse cultures or ideas. Consequently, people's worldviews become limited and homogeneous, perpetuating the cycle of uniformity and suppressing individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, the depiction of sameness in Gopher Prairie suggests a lack of individuality and cultural diversity by highlighting the town's emphasis on conformity over personal expression, as well as its contribution to a limited and monotonous existence for its inhabitants." />

Nine-tenths of the American towns are so&#10;alike that it is the completest boredom to wander from one to another.&#10;Always, west of Pittsburg, and often, east of it, there is the same&#10;lumber yard, the same railroad station, the same Ford garage, the same&#10;creamery" />

At first, she feels despair when she learns about his upcoming marriage, and she even follows him and his bride-to-be in her mind as they leave for their honeymoon. Later on, she becomes indignant when she believes that Carol, Kennicott's wife, does not appreciate him enough or the town where they live.&#10;&#10;Vida identifies herself with Kennicott and creates a mystical relationship between herself and Carol so that she can feel as if she is still connected to him. She also attempts to reconcile her feelings of love with her religious beliefs. For instance, she prays about her love for Kennicott and tries to equate it to her love for the Son of God. She even considers becoming a nun and observing perpetual adoration. Additionally, when she feels jealous about Carol's charm and grace, she tells herself that she expects gratitude from Carol since she had received Kennicott's love through her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Vida experiences an intense emotional struggle due to her unrequited love for Dr. Kennicott, and she attempts to reconcile her feelings with her religious beliefs by praying about her love and equating it to her love for God.

She told herself that she did not want part of him; unless he&#10;gave her all his devotion she would never let him touch her; and when&#10;she found that she was probably lying, she burned with scorn.

    <node id="The speaker believes that Gopher Prairie is a good town and that the protagonist, Carol, is lucky to be there because it offers a strong sense of community and human connection that can't be found in larger cities. The speaker argues that despite the potential allure of urban centers like New York, smaller towns provide a more intimate network of relationships, which they find more valuable.&#10;&#10;The speaker also highlights the importance of recognizing the efforts and contributions of individuals who have worked hard to build and maintain these communities.

    <node id="Carol's insightful criticism is that prairie towns, like Gopher Prairie, exist not to serve the farmers who are their reason for existence but rather to exploit them. She points out that these towns provide large motors and social preferment to the townsmen while giving little back in return. The remedy she suggests for this issue is criticism as a starting point. By critically examining the current situation, people can begin to address the problem of mediocrity and exploitation present in prairie towns." />

She is particularly critical of his hypocrisy and egotism, which she feels are masked by his buoyant personality.

    <node id="The woman in question is Carol Kennicott, who underwent significant changes after marrying Ray. She became more self-confident and happy, which was reflected in her physical appearance as she became plumper and more energetic. Her thoughts, once consumed by marriage and family, were now focused on reforming the town, such as purchasing a park and enforcing cleanliness regulations for backyards.&#10;&#10;Carol's newfound self-assurance also led to changes at the Bon Ton store where Ray worked. She confronted Harry Haydock, Ray's boss, demanding that Ray be made a partner in the business due to his contributions in building up the shoe and men's departments. When Harry hesitated, Carol threatened to start a rival shop with Ray, which ultimately led to Ray becoming a one-sixth partner in the Bon Ton store.&#10;&#10;Ray's promotion, however, did not come with additional responsibilities or decision-making power. Instead, he became a glorified floor-walker, greeting customers with newfound confidence and poise. Ray's relationship with Vida Sherwin also evolved as they discovered intellectual companionship in each other, discussing topics such as Carol Kennicott and various other matters related to Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;In summary, after marrying Ray, Carol transformed from a sentimental and submissive woman into a confident and assertive individual who advocated for her husband's rights at the Bon Ton store, ultimately leading to his promotion.

These traits may be seen as challenging or difficult by others, particularly in a society with conventional gender roles and expectations. Therefore, the underlying reason for Carol's perceived difficulty may be her assertive and independent personality, which sets her apart from societal norms and conventions." />

This perpetuates the status quo and prevents growth, leading to a sense of dullness and dissatisfaction for some residents like Carol.&#10;&#10;2. Carol finds the town dull and unsatisfying due to several reasons she perceives as &quot;vacuousness, bad manners, and spiteful gossip.&quot; She also criticizes the lack of intellectual stimulation and romance in the community, which is exemplified by her longing for a hypothetical Frenchman who represents adventure, passion, and cynicism. Furthermore, Carol feels frustrated with the conventional gender roles and expectations that govern her life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's criticism of the town as dull stems from her desire for change and growth, which she believes is hindered by the complacency of its prominent residents.

The first&#10;tradition, repeated in scores of magazines every month, is that the&#10;American village remains the one sure abode of friendship, honesty,&#10;and clean sweet marriageable girls. Therefore all men who succeed in&#10;painting in Paris or in finance in New York at last become weary of&#10;smart women, return to their native towns, assert that cities are&#10;vicious, marry their childhood sweethearts and, presumably, joyously&#10;abide in those towns until death.&#10;&#10;The other tradition is that the significant features of all villages are&#10;whiskers, iron dogs upon lawns, gold bricks, checkers, jars of gilded&#10;cat-tails, and shrewd comic" />
    <node id="The dominating dullness and conformity of Gopher Prairie have a significant impact on foreigners, such as the first-generation Scandinavian immigrants. As depicted in the narrative, these immigrants willingly give up their traditional cultural practices, like spiced puddings and red jackets, along with the ancient Christmas hymns of the fjords, in exchange for adopting Americanized customs and ready-made clothes.&#10;&#10;This assimilation leads to a loss of their unique cultural identity within just one generation. The Scandinavian women trade their vibrant traditions for a monotonous grayness that reflects Gopher Prairie's lack of individuality and cultural diversity. Their sons complete the process by sinking into propriety, further emphasizing how sound American customs absorb alien invaders without any trace of preserving those new customs or cultural pollination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gopher Prairie's dominating dullness negatively impacts foreigners by encouraging them to abandon their traditional cultures in favor of the town's uniform and unimaginative lifestyle. This results in a loss of cultural diversity and highlights the pervasive lack of individuality within the community, further perpetuating the cycle of sameness and suppressing unique identities." />
    <node id="The text does not provide explicit information about what changes in psychology and society Carol expected to see as a result of the war. However, based on her character and her desire for independence, it can be inferred that she might have anticipated more progressive attitudes towards women's roles and gender equality.&#10;&#10;As for why these changes hadn't occurred yet, the text suggests that individuals often abandon initiatives and reform efforts when they don't see immediate or perfect results. This observation could apply to post-war societal changes as well. People might have started advocating for progressive changes after the war, but the lack of quick progress may have led to a loss of momentum and interest, resulting in the limited changes that Carol observed at the time she was hearing about them.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the text highlights how prairie towns like Gopher Prairie exist to exploit farmers rather than serve them, with little critical examination of the current situation. This reluctance to challenge societal norms and conventions could also hinder progressive changes in psychology and society after the war." />
    <node id="The text warns that a standardized and self-assured small town, like Gopher Prairie, poses unique dangers to the rest of the world because it aspires to become the chief mediocrity, seeking to dominate other civilizations. This village's drive for standardization aims to drain the hills and sea of color, meaning it wants to homogenize the diversity and richness of different cultures. By being self-assured and bullying other civilizations, a place like Gopher Prairie could potentially suppress individuality, cultural diversity, and creativity on a global scale. This perspective is exemplified when Carol realizes that the true problem with Gopher Prairie lies not only in its dullness but also in its aspiration to become a dominant force that could impose its mediocrity on the entire world." />

She also values intellectual companionship and respects men who have constructive careers, such as Raymie.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Vida is not immune to physical attraction and romantic feelings towards men. This is evident in her secret attraction to Kennicott and her desire to be close to him despite her religious beliefs and his upcoming marriage.

    <node id="Gopher Prairie aspires for global acceptance of its materialistic values due to its self-assuredness and drive for dominance over other civilizations. This small town seeks to homogenize diversity and richness of different cultures, imposing its mediocrity on the world.

    <node id="Based on the provided text, there is no direct information about Mrs. Jellyby's behavior and circumstances after getting married. The passage focuses on Carol Kennicott's transformation after marrying Ray. However, I can provide an answer based on the given context and assuming that you have some background knowledge of Mrs. Jellyby from Charles Dickens' novel &quot;Bleak House.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Jellyby is a character known for her obsession with the fictional African country of Borrioboola-Gha, neglecting her family responsibilities to dedicate herself to philanthropic activities. Although there is no direct mention of Mrs. Jellyby's post-marital changes in this text, it does provide some insights into how Carol Kennicott transforms after marrying Ray and applies those learnings to answer your question:&#10;&#10;Carol Kennicott underwent significant changes in her personality and outlook after getting married. She became more self-confident and assertive, which led her to advocate for reforms in the town of Gopher Prairie. For instance, she successfully lobbied for purchasing a park and enforcing cleanliness regulations.&#10;&#10;Similarly, it is plausible to assume that Mrs. Jellyby might have undergone some transformation after getting married as well. Assuming her character remains consistent with Dickens' portrayal, she may have used her newfound confidence to further advocate for her reform ideas in the town. Her obsession with Borrioboola-Gha might have provided her with an even stronger platform to push for change and raise awareness about social issues both locally and abroad.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that Mrs. Jellyby's neglect of her family responsibilities could have been exacerbated after marriage, as she became more focused on her philanthropic pursuits. This might have led to conflicts with her spouse and further strain in her personal relationships. Nevertheless, without specific information about Mrs. Jellyby's post-marital changes in the text provided, it is difficult to give a definitive answer." />

This uniformity is indicative of a &quot;philosophy of dull safety,&quot; where conformity is prioritized over personal expression or creativity. The lack of variety in buildings, shops, and even people's appearances demonstrates how the community suppresses uniqueness and difference, fostering an environment that stifles personal growth and development.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the fact that Kennicott could be transported to another town without realizing it emphasizes the pervasive sameness in American towns. This lack of distinctiveness between places implies a monotonous existence for their inhabitants, with little opportunity for exposure to diverse cultures or ideas. Consequently, people's worldviews become limited and homogeneous, perpetuating the cycle of uniformity and suppressing individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, the depiction of sameness in Gopher Prairie suggests a lack of individuality and cultural diversity by highlighting the town's emphasis on conformity over personal expression, as well as its contribution to a limited and monotonous existence for its inhabitants.">

Carol finds the town dull and unsatisfying due to several reasons she perceives as &quot;vacuousness, bad manners, and spiteful gossip.&quot; She also criticizes the lack of intellectual stimulation and romance in the community, which is exemplified by her longing for a hypothetical Frenchman who represents adventure, passion, and cynicism.

As depicted in the narrative, these immigrants willingly give up their traditional cultural practices, like spiced puddings and red jackets, along with the ancient Christmas hymns of the fjords, in exchange for adopting Americanized customs and ready-made clothes.&#10;&#10;This assimilation leads to a loss of their unique cultural identity within just one generation. The Scandinavian women trade their vibrant traditions for a monotonous grayness that reflects Gopher Prairie's lack of individuality and cultural diversity. Their sons complete the process by sinking into propriety, further emphasizing how sound American customs absorb alien invaders without any trace of preserving those new customs or cultural pollination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gopher Prairie's dominating dullness negatively impacts foreigners by encouraging them to abandon their traditional cultures in favor of the town's uniform and unimaginative lifestyle. This results in a loss of cultural diversity and highlights the pervasive lack of individuality within the community, further perpetuating the cycle of sameness and suppressing unique identities.">

However, I can provide an answer based on the given context and assuming that you have some background knowledge of Mrs. Jellyby from Charles Dickens' novel &quot;Bleak House.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Jellyby is a character known for her obsession with the fictional African country of Borrioboola-Gha, neglecting her family responsibilities to dedicate herself to philanthropic activities. Although there is no direct mention of Mrs. Jellyby's post-marital changes in this text, it does provide some insights into how Carol Kennicott transforms after marrying Ray and applies those learnings to answer your question:&#10;&#10;Carol Kennicott underwent significant changes in her personality and outlook after getting married. She became more self-confident and assertive, which led her to advocate for reforms in the town of Gopher Prairie. For instance, she successfully lobbied for purchasing a park and enforcing cleanliness regulations.&#10;&#10;Similarly, it is plausible to assume that Mrs. Jellyby might have undergone some transformation after getting married as well. Assuming her character remains consistent with Dickens' portrayal, she may have used her newfound confidence to further advocate for her reform ideas in the town. Her obsession with Borrioboola-Gha might have provided her with an even stronger platform to push for change and raise awareness about social issues both locally and abroad.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that Mrs. Jellyby's neglect of her family responsibilities could have been exacerbated after marriage, as she became more focused on her philanthropic pursuits. This might have led to conflicts with her spouse and further strain in her personal relationships. Nevertheless, without specific information about Mrs. Jellyby's post-marital changes in the text provided, it is difficult to give a definitive answer.">

As depicted in the narrative, these immigrants willingly give up their traditional cultural practices, like spiced puddings and red jackets, along with the ancient Christmas hymns of the fjords, in exchange for adopting Americanized customs and ready-made clothes.&#10;&#10;This assimilation leads to a loss of their unique cultural identity within just one generation. The Scandinavian women trade their vibrant traditions for a monotonous grayness that reflects Gopher Prairie's lack of individuality and cultural diversity. Their sons complete the process by sinking into propriety, further emphasizing how sound American customs absorb alien invaders without any trace of preserving those new customs or cultural pollination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gopher Prairie's dominating dullness negatively impacts foreigners by encouraging them to abandon their traditional cultures in favor of the town's uniform and unimaginative lifestyle. This results in a loss of cultural diversity and highlights the pervasive lack of individuality within the community, further perpetuating the cycle of sameness and suppressing unique identities.">

But before I start in&#10;being a hero I want to shoot out and catch me a big black bass and cuss&#10;out you and Sam Clark and Harry Haydock and Will Kennicott and the rest&#10;of you pirates. I'll land in G. P. on June 7, on No. 7 from Mpls. Shake&#10;a day-day. Tell Bert Tybee to save me a glass of beer.&#10;&#10;Sincerely yours,&#10;&#10;Perce.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;All members of">

Carol saw Bresnahan laughing down at them from the train&#10;vestibule--big, immaculate, overjawed, with the eye of an executive. In&#10;the voice of the professional Good Fellow he bellowed, &quot;Howdy, folks!&quot;&#10;As she was introduced to him (not he to her) Bresnahan looked into her&#10;eyes, and his hand-shake was warm, unhurried.&#10;&#10;He declined the offers of motors; he walked off, his arm about the&#10;shoulder of Nat Hicks the sporting tailor, with the elegant Harry&#10;Haydock carrying one of his enormous pale leather bags, Del Snafflin&#10;the other, Jack Elder bearing an overcoat, and Julius Flickerbaugh&#10;the fishing-tackle.

He had given&#10;a hundred dollars to Father Klubok the priest, and a hundred to the&#10;Reverend Mr. Zitterel the Baptist minister, for Americanization work.&#10;&#10;At the Bon Ton, Carol heard Nat Hicks the tailor exulting:&#10;&#10;&quot;Old Perce certainly pulled a good one on this fellow Bjornstam that&#10;always is shooting off his mouth.

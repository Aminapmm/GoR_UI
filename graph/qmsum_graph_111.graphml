Plastic was also seen as a viable option due to its low cost and high malleability." />
    <node id=" Oh .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: What about the ca&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: yeah .

    <node id=" Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , {vocalsound} or titanium .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um {vocalsound} I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . {vocalsound} Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,&#10;" />
    <node id=" , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .

    <node id=" too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: What about you ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm . Kind of like an internal egg .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Cover .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Plastic inside" />
    <node id=" User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Is this {gap} to the market {gap} ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .

    <node id="The different material options for the case are plastic and rubber. Wood and titanium were initially suggested but were eliminated due to cost concerns and difficulty in shaping (in the case of titanium). The surface configurations for the case can be flat, curved, or double curved, with the latter two being more challenging if standard components are used.&#10;&#10;For the interface components, push buttons and scroll buttons are mentioned as possibilities. The scroll button could potentially incorporate a push function, which would simplify the design by combining multiple functions into one component. A specific volume up and down button may not be necessary if the scroll wheel can handle these functions as well." />

Good point .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down .

    <node id="1. The industrial designer expresses concern about creating a spongy component for the device, stating that it would be difficult to design from a component level. This could present a challenge in terms of manufacturing and engineering.&#10;2. The user interface expert raises a concern about the feasibility of the spongy fruit and veg idea, questioning if it is actually a market requirement.&#10;3. The project manager acknowledges that there are budgeting issues when considering multiple interchangeable components for the device. This could increase production costs and impact the overall pricing strategy for the product.&#10;4. The industrial designer points out that using rubber as a material to achieve sponginess might be more feasible, but it may not meet the desired aesthetic or perceived value of the fancy model the marketing team is proposing.&#10;5. Although not explicitly stated, the discussion about alternative materials (such as wood, titanium, and plastic) and design concepts (like a wind-up or kinetic energy source) suggests that finding the right balance between design, functionality, and cost will be challenging for the spongy fruit and veg idea." />

    <node id="1. The group expresses positive sentiments towards using a kinetic battery as an alternative to the standard battery. They discuss its advantages, such as not requiring recharging or replacing batteries like a traditional battery, and being more reliable than solar power in dark conditions.&#10;2. The kinetic battery is seen as a potential solution to the concerns raised about the spongy fruit and veg idea's feasibility and market requirement. It is also mentioned that it could be a good selling point for the product due to its convenience and uniqueness.&#10;3. However, the group is aware of the need to consider cost implications and development requirements for the kinetic battery option. The user interface expert mentions that the final decision will depend on how much it costs and how much more development and research are needed.&#10;4. In terms of weight and convenience, the kinetic battery is viewed as a positive choice because it would make the product lighter and more convenient to use, as users wouldn't have to worry about replacing batteries or charging the device. The marketing team even jokes about throwing the banana (presumably the product with the kinetic battery) to keep it moving and charged.&#10;5. While there is a consensus among the group that using a kinetic battery would be preferable if possible, they also understand that further investigation into its cost and development needs is necessary before making a final decision." />

    <node id="1. Aesthetics: The design should be polished and elegant, with an emphasis on vibrant colors and interesting textures to appeal to consumers. Technologically superior fabrics or substances can be incorporated into the simple handset to make it more innovative and unique.&#10;&#10;2. Ease of use: While not the top priority, ease of use is still important for purchasing decisions. The remote control's interface components, such as push buttons and scroll buttons, should be intuitive and easy to use. Combining multiple functions into one component, like a scroll wheel that can also adjust volume, can help simplify the design.&#10;&#10;3. Price: Although not explicitly stated in the research, budgeting issues may arise when considering interchangeable components or more advanced materials. It is essential to find a balance between design, functionality, and cost to ensure the final product is appealing to consumers and competitively priced within the market.&#10;&#10;4. Manufacturing and engineering: Using unconventional materials like rubber for sponginess might be more feasible than designing a spongy component from scratch. However, this may not meet the desired aesthetic or perceived value of the fancy model the marketing team is proposing. Consideration should be given to how the chosen design and materials will impact manufacturing and engineering processes.&#10;&#10;5. Market requirements: It is crucial to question whether proposed features, such as a spongy component, are actual market requirements. Conducting further research to understand consumer needs and preferences can help inform design decisions and ensure the final product will be well-received in the market." />
    <node id=": Marketing&#10;Content: because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . {vocalsound} And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . So . {vocalsound} I also did a little research on um {vocalsound} what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , {vocalsound} you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically {vocalsound} superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances .

    <node id="1. In Kate's presentation, she discussed various interface options available for the remote control device. However, the specific content of her presentation is not provided in the transcript. Therefore, it is difficult to make a direct comparison between the interfaces presented by Kate and the proposed push button interface in terms of detail and relevance.&#10;2. The marketing team seems to agree with the idea of having a push button interface, as they mention that &quot;we can't do anything fancier&quot; and later express their approval for this concept. However, they also suggest incorporating volume up and down functions into the scroll wheel, which is not explicitly addressed in the proposed design.&#10;3. The user interface team raises a valid point about the potential lack of specific volume up and down buttons if a scroll wheel is used. While the scroll wheel can support up-down movements, it may not be as intuitive for users to adjust the volume using this method. This could be an important consideration when comparing different interface options in terms of detail and relevance.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the specific interfaces presented by Kate are not provided in the transcript, it is clear that both teams are discussing and considering various interface options for the remote control device. The proposed push button interface seems to have garnered some support from the marketing team, but there may be some potential drawbacks to consider when it comes to functionality and user experience." />

    <node id="1. Material Options: The two primary material options for the case are plastic and rubber. Plastic is favored due to its low cost and high malleability, while rubber is considered as it can provide a spongy feel, which is desired by the marketing team. Titanium and wood were initially suggested but eliminated due to cost concerns and difficulty in shaping (in the case of titanium).&#10;&#10;2. Surface Configurations: The surface configurations for the case can be flat, curved, or double curved. However, the latter two options may be more challenging if standard components are used.&#10;&#10;3. Interface Components: For the interface components, push buttons and scroll buttons are mentioned as possibilities. A scroll button incorporating a push function would simplify the design by combining multiple functions into one component, making the design more user-friendly. Alternatively, a specific volume up and down button may not be necessary if the scroll wheel can handle these functions as well." />
    <node id="1. Possible design materials include plastic and rubber, as they were discussed positively during the meeting. Rubber is considered as a potential material to provide a spongy feel, which is desired by the marketing team. Plastic was seen as a viable option due to its low cost and high malleability. Other materials like wood and titanium were mentioned but later eliminated from consideration (wood for being less durable and titanium for being too expensive and not suitable for double curves)." />
    <node id="1. The group has positive sentiments towards using a kinetic power source as an alternative to traditional batteries or solar power. They see it as more convenient and reliable than solar power in dark conditions and preferable to traditional batteries because it wouldn't require recharging or replacing batteries.&#10;2. The kinetic battery is viewed as a potential solution for the concerns raised about the feasibility and market requirement of the spongy fruit and veg idea. It could also serve as a unique selling point for the product due to its convenience and novelty.&#10;3. While the group favors the kinetic option, they are aware of the need to consider cost implications and development requirements. The final decision will depend on how much it costs and how much more development and research are needed.&#10;4. In terms of weight and convenience, the kinetic battery is seen as a positive choice because it would make the product lighter and more convenient to use since users wouldn't have to worry about replacing batteries or charging the device.&#10;5. The primary cost consequence of using a kinetic power source is higher development and research costs due to its innovative nature. However, it could potentially reduce costs in the long run by eliminating the need for replacing or recharging batteries. Its practicality lies in its ability to generate enough power through movement to consistently operate the device.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group sees the kinetic power source as a favorable option due to its convenience, reliability, and potential as a unique selling point. However, they acknowledge the need for further investigation into its cost and development needs before making a final decision." />
    <node id="Using titanium for the device may be too expensive due to its higher cost compared to other materials like plastic or rubber. This could increase the overall cost of the device and make it less competitive in the market. Additionally, titanium can be difficult to shape, especially if double curved surfaces are required, which would add to its production costs and complexity.&#10;&#10;The suggested alternative material is rubber, as it provides a more colorful, organic aesthetic that aligns with the current marketing trend focusing on more organic and approachable designs with spongy textures and fruit and vegetable motifs. Rubber can also provide a spongy feel, which is desired by the marketing team. Plastic is another viable option due to its low cost and high malleability.&#10;&#10;Therefore, using rubber or plastic as an alternative material would be more cost-effective and better suited for creating fancy shapes than titanium." />
    <node id="1. Marketing Content Speaker: They think that the selection wheel is a good idea and could be a selling point for the product. However, they also mention that it's important to consider the cost and development time needed for this feature.&#10;2. User Interface Content Speaker: They like the idea of the selection wheel and find it attractive and user-friendly. They suggest implementing it with four buttons (up, down, left, and right) with an enter button in the middle to correspond to a menu on the screen.&#10;3. Project Manager Content Speaker: They are open to the idea of using the selection wheel but want to ensure that it's cost-effective and feasible. They also mention the need to discuss individual actions and look and feel design for Kate.&#10;4. Industrial Designer Content Speaker: While they don't have information on costing, they mention that the two front-runners in terms of workability are the standard battery or the kinetic option. They also express their opinion about the company's next project being to design a better overhead device that switches immediately.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group seems generally positive about the selection wheel concept but wants to ensure it is cost-effective and feasible. There is some discussion around alternative implementations, such as using four buttons instead of a physical scroll wheel. The marketing speaker also emphasizes the importance of considering the selling points and potential user appeal of this feature." />

    <node id="The proposed features for the hand-held device's interface include physical buttons arranged in an up, down, left, right configuration with an enter function in the middle. This circular button layout would also incorporate a mouse-style scrolling feature in the middle, which can support up, down, left, and right movements as well as an enter function. However, the idea of using an iPod-style scroll wheel specifically was not mentioned in the transcript. Additionally, the information for this interface would be displayed on the television screen instead of directly on the device." />
    <node id="1. The interesting concept for a remote control involves using a wind-up kinetic energy source, which would allow the device to be powered without needing traditional batteries or recharging. This could make the product more convenient and environmentally friendly, as well as potentially reducing manufacturing costs associated with battery components.&#10;   &#10;2. This alternative may not fit well with a fruit and vegetable theme because it diverges from the current trend of incorporating organic and approachable designs with spongy textures and fruit motifs. A wind-up kinetic energy source might be more suitable for products that aim to emphasize functionality, reliability, and eco-friendliness rather than adhering to specific design trends.&#10;   &#10;3. Another possible reason is that the user experience of winding up a remote control device may not align with the playful and customizable nature of the fruit and vegetable theme. The interaction could feel less intuitive or fun compared to using interchangeable spongy fruit-themed sleeves, which might better suit the overall vision for the product." />
    <node id="The participants are discussing the use of spongy materials, specifically rubber, for the remote control device's covers. They appreciate its potential tactile appeal, referring to the ability to squeeze it (indicating a desirable texture). However, they are also considering feasibility issues related to manufacturing and engineering such a design. The user interface team questions if a spongy material is truly a market requirement, while the marketing team expresses interest in exploring fruit-colored and themed designs. There is an ongoing dialogue about finding the right balance between design, functionality, and cost, with concerns raised regarding budgeting issues that may arise from using multiple interchangeable components or more advanced materials. The sports on television don't seem to be directly related to their discussion but might serve as background noise during the meeting." />
    <node id="1. A circular button layout with up, down, left, and right push buttons to accommodate multiple televisions in a household, providing users with a backup or personalized option for controlling the TV.&#10;2. A mouse-style scrolling feature in the middle of the device that supports up, down, left, and right movements as well as an enter function, combining multiple functions into one component for user-friendliness.&#10;3. Using vibrant colors and interesting textures to appeal to consumers, especially if the remote is aimed at children. Technologically superior fabrics or substances can be incorporated into the simple handset to make it more innovative and unique.&#10;4. Ease of use should be considered with intuitive and easy-to-use interface components, such as push buttons and scroll buttons. Combining multiple functions into one component, like a scroll wheel that can also adjust volume, can help simplify the design.&#10;5. Consideration for budgeting issues to ensure the final product is appealing to consumers and competitively priced within the market, especially when incorporating additional features or more advanced materials.&#10;6. Investigation into manufacturing and engineering processes to determine feasibility, particularly if unconventional materials like rubber are used for sponginess or other design elements.&#10;7. Questioning whether proposed features, such as a spongy component, are actual market requirements by conducting further research to understand consumer needs and preferences can help inform design decisions and ensure the final product will be well-received in the market.&#10;8. Excluding the wind-up kinetic energy source feature since it may not align with the playful and customizable nature of a fruit and vegetable theme, focusing instead on creating a fun and engaging user experience through other design elements." />
    <node id="The conversation about &quot;F\_N\_ and F\_ eight&quot; refers to the function keys F2 and F8, which were mentioned earlier in the meeting. It's important for the user interface to include these function keys without any issues because they are necessary for the device's functionality. The team is discussing various ways to incorporate these keys into the design, such as using a push-button interface with up, down, left, and right buttons, along with an enter function in the middle. This would make it easier for users to navigate through menus and access various functions on the device." />

Kinetic: The kinetic option would likely have higher development and research costs due to its innovative nature. However, it could potentially reduce costs in the long run by eliminating the need for replacing or recharging batteries. Its practical consideration lies in its ability to generate enough power through movement to consistently operate the device.&#10;&#10;3. Solar: The primary cost consequence of using solar power is the initial investment in a high-quality solar panel and any necessary energy storage components. Practical considerations include dependence on sunlight, which may not always be available, and potential limitations in power generation during periods of poor weather or at night.&#10;&#10;The group's decision will depend on how much they are willing to invest upfront and their tolerance for the limitations and inconveniences associated with each energy source option. The kinetic battery is favored due to its convenience, reliability, and potential as a unique selling point; however, further investigation into its cost and development needs is necessary before making a final decision.">

In Kate's presentation, she discussed various interface options available for the remote control device. However, the specific content of her presentation is not provided in the transcript. Therefore, it is difficult to make a direct comparison between the interfaces presented by Kate and the proposed push button interface in terms of detail and relevance.&#10;2. The marketing team seems to agree with the idea of having a push button interface, as they mention that &quot;we can't do anything fancier&quot; and later express their approval for this concept. However, they also suggest incorporating volume up and down functions into the scroll wheel, which is not explicitly addressed in the proposed design.&#10;3. The user interface team raises a valid point about the potential lack of specific volume up and down buttons if a scroll wheel is used.

The interesting concept for a remote control involves using a wind-up kinetic energy source, which would allow the device to be powered without needing traditional batteries or recharging. This could make the product more convenient and environmentally friendly, as well as potentially reducing manufacturing costs associated with battery components.&#10;   &#10;2. This alternative may not fit well with a fruit and vegetable theme because it diverges from the current trend of incorporating organic and approachable designs with spongy textures and fruit motifs. A wind-up kinetic energy source might be more suitable for products that aim to emphasize functionality, reliability, and eco-friendliness rather than adhering to specific design trends.&#10;   &#10;3. Another possible reason is that the user experience of winding up a remote control device may not align with the playful and customizable nature of the fruit and vegetable theme. The interaction could feel less intuitive or fun compared to using interchangeable spongy fruit-themed sleeves, which might better suit the overall vision for the product.">

The group has positive sentiments towards using a kinetic power source as an alternative to traditional batteries or solar power. They see it as more convenient and reliable than solar power in dark conditions and preferable to traditional batteries because it wouldn't require recharging or replacing batteries.&#10;2. The kinetic battery is viewed as a potential solution for the concerns raised about the feasibility and market requirement of the spongy fruit and veg idea. It could also serve as a unique selling point for the product due to its convenience and novelty.&#10;3. While the group favors the kinetic option, they are aware of the need to consider cost implications and development requirements. The final decision will depend on how much it costs and how much more development and research are needed.&#10;4. In terms of weight and convenience, the kinetic battery is seen as a positive choice because it would make the product lighter and more convenient to use since users wouldn't have to worry about replacing batteries or charging the device.&#10;5. The primary cost consequence of using a kinetic power source is higher development and research costs due to its innovative nature. However, it could potentially reduce costs in the long run by eliminating the need for replacing or recharging batteries. Its practicality lies in its ability to generate enough power through movement to consistently operate the device.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group sees the kinetic power source as a favorable option due to its convenience, reliability, and potential as a unique selling point. However, they acknowledge the need for further investigation into its cost and development needs before making a final decision.">

    <edge source="1. Material Options: The two primary material options for the case are plastic and rubber. Plastic is favored due to its low cost and high malleability, while rubber is considered as it can provide a spongy feel, which is desired by the marketing team. Titanium and wood were initially suggested but eliminated due to cost concerns and difficulty in shaping (in the case of titanium).&#10;&#10;2. Surface Configurations: The surface configurations for the case can be flat, curved, or double curved. However, the latter two options may be more challenging if standard components are used.&#10;&#10;3. Interface Components: For the interface components, push buttons and scroll buttons are mentioned as possibilities. A scroll button incorporating a push function would simplify the design by combining multiple functions into one component, making the design more user-friendly. Alternatively, a specific volume up and down button may not be necessary if the scroll wheel can handle these functions as well." target="Using titanium for the device may be too expensive due to its higher cost compared to other materials like plastic or rubber. This could increase the overall cost of the device and make it less competitive in the market.

Rubber can also provide a spongy feel, which is desired by the marketing team. Plastic is another viable option due to its low cost and high malleability.&#10;&#10;Therefore, using rubber or plastic as an alternative material would be more cost-effective and better suited for creating fancy shapes than titanium.">

The interesting concept for a remote control involves using a wind-up kinetic energy source, which would allow the device to be powered without needing traditional batteries or recharging. This could make the product more convenient and environmentally friendly, as well as potentially reducing manufacturing costs associated with battery components.&#10;   &#10;2. This alternative may not fit well with a fruit and vegetable theme because it diverges from the current trend of incorporating organic and approachable designs with spongy textures and fruit motifs. A wind-up kinetic energy source might be more suitable for products that aim to emphasize functionality, reliability, and eco-friendliness rather than adhering to specific design trends.&#10;   &#10;3. Another possible reason is that the user experience of winding up a remote control device may not align with the playful and customizable nature of the fruit and vegetable theme.

    <node id="At the chapel near the Fulham Road, George and William found a chariot with four horses and a glass coach waiting for them. This was considered a disappointing arrangement because George had expected only a pair of horses, as he mentioned to Jos Sedley's servant. Additionally, the text mentions that &quot;with scarce so much as a breakfast or a wedding favor,&quot; implying that the setup was not as grand as they had hoped for." />

Only a very few idlers were collected on account&#10;of the dismal rain.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hang it!&quot; said George, &quot;I said only a pair.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My master would have four,&quot; said Mr. Joseph Sedley's servant, who was&#10;in waiting; and he and Mr. Osborne's man agreed as they followed George&#10;and William into the church, that it was a &quot;reg'lar shabby turn hout;&#10;and" />
    <node id=" Dobbin.&#10;&#10;When the service was completed, Jos Sedley came forward and kissed his&#10;sister, the bride, for the first time for many months--George's look of&#10;gloom had gone, and he seemed quite proud and radiant. &quot;It's your turn,&#10;William,&quot; says he, putting his hand fondly upon Dobbin's shoulder; and&#10;Dobbin went up and touched Amelia on the cheek.&#10;&#10;Then they went into the vestry and signed the register. &quot;God bless you,&#10;Old Dobbin,&quot; George said, grasping him by the hand, with something very&#10;like moisture glistening in his eyes.  William replied only by nodding&#10;his head. His heart was too full to say much.&#10;&#10;&quot;Write directly, and come down as soon as you can, you know,&quot; Osborne&#10;said.  After Mrs. Sedley had taken an hysterical adieu of her daughter,&#10;the pair went off to the carriage.  &quot;Get out of the way, you little&#10;devils,&quot; George cried to a small crowd of damp urchins, that were&#10;hanging about the chapel-door.  The rain drove into the bride and&#10;bridegroom's faces as they passed" />
    <node id=" family and mine are separated&#10;for ever.  I'm fallen low, but not so low as that: no, no. And so you&#10;may tell the whole race--son, and father and sisters, and all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's my belief, sir, that you have not the power or the right to&#10;separate those two,&quot; Dobbin answered in a low voice; &quot;and that if you&#10;don't give your daughter your consent it will be her duty to marry&#10;without it.  There's no reason she should die or live miserably because&#10;you are wrong-headed.  To my thinking, she's just as much married as if&#10;the banns had been read in all the churches in London.  And what better&#10;answer can there be to Osborne's charges against you, as charges there&#10;are, than that his son claims to enter your family and marry your&#10;daughter?&quot;&#10;&#10;A light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old Sedley&#10;as this point was put to him: but he still persisted that with his&#10;consent the marriage between Amelia and George should never take place.&#10;&#10;&quot;We must do it without,&quot; Dobbin said, smiling, and told Mr. Sedley," />
    <node id=". Osborne's man agreed as they followed George&#10;and William into the church, that it was a &quot;reg'lar shabby turn hout;&#10;and with scarce so much as a breakfast or a wedding faviour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Here you are,&quot; said our old friend, Jos Sedley, coming forward.&#10;&quot;You're five minutes late, George, my boy. What a day, eh? Demmy, it's&#10;like the commencement of the rainy season in Bengal.  But you'll find&#10;my carriage is watertight.  Come along, my mother and Emmy are in the&#10;vestry.&quot;&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley was splendid.  He was fatter than ever.  His shirt collars&#10;were higher; his face was redder; his shirt-frill flaunted gorgeously&#10;out of his variegated waistcoat. Varnished boots were not invented as&#10;yet; but the Hessians on his beautiful legs shone so, that they must&#10;have been the identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture&#10;used to shave himself; and on his light green coat there bloomed a fine&#10;wedding favour, like a great white spreading magnolia.&#10;&#10;In a word, George had thrown" />
    <node id="a hint,&quot; there was no&#10;possibility for the most obtuse to mistake his meaning.  He called&#10;kicking a footman downstairs a hint to the latter to leave his service.&#10;With his usual frankness and delicacy he told Mrs. Haggistoun that he&#10;would give her a cheque for five thousand pounds on the day his son was&#10;married to her ward; and called that proposal a hint, and considered it&#10;a very dexterous piece of diplomacy.  He gave George finally such&#10;another hint regarding the heiress; and ordered him to marry her out of&#10;hand, as he would have ordered his butler to draw a cork, or his clerk&#10;to write a letter.&#10;&#10;This imperative hint disturbed George a good deal.  He was in the very&#10;first enthusiasm and delight of his second courtship of Amelia, which&#10;was inexpressibly sweet to him.  The contrast of her manners and&#10;appearance with those of the heiress, made the idea of a union with the&#10;latter appear doubly ludicrous and odious.  Carriages and opera-boxes,&#10;thought he; fancy being seen in them by the side of such a mahogany&#10;charmer" />
    <node id="orily, Dobbin thought. He knew what a savage&#10;determined man Osborne was, and how he stuck by his word. &quot;The only&#10;chance George has of reconcilement,&quot; argued his friend, &quot;is by&#10;distinguishing himself in the coming campaign.  If he dies they both go&#10;together.  If he fails in distinction--what then?  He has some money&#10;from his mother, I have heard enough to purchase his majority--or he&#10;must sell out and go and dig in Canada, or rough it in a cottage in the&#10;country.&quot; With such a partner Dobbin thought he would not mind&#10;Siberia--and, strange to say, this absurd and utterly imprudent young&#10;fellow never for a moment considered that the want of means to keep a&#10;nice carriage and horses, and of an income which should enable its&#10;possessors to entertain their friends genteelly, ought to operate as&#10;bars to the union of George and Miss Sedley.&#10;&#10;It was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the&#10;marriage should take place as quickly as possible.  Was he anxious&#10;himself, I wonder, to have it over?--as people, when death has&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Awful and pleasing notion of Wealth: The text suggests that there is something awful and pleasing about wealth that naturally attracts people, even members of the British public, to it. This fascination is so strong that they cannot help but look at a wealthy person with interest.&#10;&#10;2. Affection for the wealthy: Old worldlings, in particular, are prone to having their affections rush out to meet and welcome money. Their kind sentiments awaken spontaneously towards the interesting possessors of it. This inclination is so strong that some respectable people don't consider themselves at liberty to indulge in friendship with anyone who doesn't have a certain competency or place in society.&#10;&#10;3. People in Vanity Fair: In this social context, money and fair repute are considered the chiefest good. Therefore, those who possess wealth and prosperity are admired and sought after, while those who lack these qualities are pitied. The text highlights that people in Vanity Fair are particularly drawn to wealth and the status it brings.&#10;&#10;4. Vipers and beggars: However, the text also acknowledges that not all relationships with wealthy individuals end well. There are some who may take advantage of one's kindness and goodwill, only to later mistreat or betray them. Still, despite these potential risks, the allure of wealth remains strong for many people in Vanity Fair." />
    <node id=" of Champagne!&#10;Hicks, Champagne to Miss Swartz.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is little doubt that old Osborne believed all he said, and that&#10;the girls were quite earnest in their protestations of affection for&#10;Miss Swartz.  People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite&#10;naturally.  If the simplest people are disposed to look not a little&#10;kindly on great Prosperity (for I defy any member of the British public&#10;to say that the notion of Wealth has not something awful and pleasing&#10;to him; and you, if you are told that the man next you at dinner has&#10;got half a million, not to look at him with a certain interest)--if the&#10;simple look benevolently on money, how much more do your old worldlings&#10;regard it!  Their affections rush out to meet and welcome money.  Their&#10;kind sentiments awaken spontaneously towards the interesting possessors&#10;of it.  I know some respectable people who don't consider themselves at&#10;liberty to indulge in friendship for any individual who has not a&#10;certain competency, or place in society.  They give a loose to their&#10;feelings on proper occasions.  And the proof is, that the major part of" />

There are some beggars that you put on&#10;horseback, and they're the first to ride you down.  You know whom I&#10;mean, William Dobbin, my boy.  I mean a purse-proud villain in Russell&#10;Square, whom I knew without a shilling, and whom I pray and hope to see&#10;a beggar as he was when I befriended him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have heard something of this, sir, from my friend George,&quot; Dobbin&#10;said, anxious to come to his point.  &quot;The quarrel between you and his&#10;father has cut him up a great deal, sir.  Indeed, I'm the bearer of a&#10;message from him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O, THAT'S your errand, is it?&quot; cried the old man, jumping up. &quot;What!&#10;perhaps he condoles with me, does he?

    <node id="urchins gave another&#10;sarcastical cheer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here, you little beggars,&quot; Dobbin said, giving some sixpences amongst&#10;them, and then went off by himself through the rain.  It was all over.&#10;They were married, and happy, he prayed God.  Never since he was a boy&#10;had he felt so miserable and so lonely.  He longed with a heart-sick&#10;yearning for the first few days to be over, that he might see her again.&#10;&#10;Some ten days after the above ceremony, three young men of our&#10;acquaintance were enjoying that beautiful prospect of bow windows on&#10;the one side and blue sea on the other, which Brighton affords to the&#10;traveller. Sometimes it is towards the ocean--smiling with countless&#10;dimples, speckled with white sails, with a hundred bathing-machines&#10;kissing the skirt of his blue garment--that the Londoner looks&#10;enraptured: sometimes, on the contrary, a lover of human nature rather&#10;than of prospects of any kind, it is towards the bow windows that he&#10;turns, and that swarm of human life which they exhibit.

Devilish good&#10;Madeira.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What a fool Rawdon Crawley has been,&quot; Clump replied, &quot;to go and marry&#10;a governess!

    <node id="John Sedley, who was once a prosperous and jovial man, has undergone a stark transformation as observed by Captain Dobbin. When they meet at a dingy house of entertainment, Sedley is described as a broken old man, with a shabby coat that has turned white at the seams, an unshaven face, and a limp frill and neckcloth hanging under his bagging waistcoat. He has fallen from prosperity and is now a humble figure, contrasting greatly with his former self who used to be generous and jovial. The change in Sedley's circumstances is evident when he hesitates to greet Dobbin, calling him &quot;Sir&quot; instead of addressing him informally as he used to in the past. Overall, the narrative paints a picture of a man who has been brought low by misfortune, and who now cuts a sorry figure compared to his once prosperous self." />
    <node id=" the&#10;favourite letters selected and laid before you; and who does not know&#10;the sad eager half-crazy look which he fixes on you with his hopeless&#10;eyes?&#10;&#10;Changed into a man of this sort, Dobbin found the once florid, jovial,&#10;and prosperous John Sedley.  His coat, that used to be so glossy and&#10;trim, was white at the seams, and the buttons showed the copper.  His&#10;face had fallen in, and was unshorn; his frill and neckcloth hung limp&#10;under his bagging waistcoat.  When he used to treat the boys in old&#10;days at a coffee-house, he would shout and laugh louder than anybody&#10;there, and have all the waiters skipping round him; it was quite&#10;painful to see how humble and civil he was to John of the Tapioca, a&#10;blear-eyed old attendant in dingy stockings and cracked pumps, whose&#10;business it was to serve glasses of wafers, and bumpers of ink in&#10;pewter, and slices of paper to the frequenters of this dreary house of&#10;entertainment, where nothing else seemed to be consumed.

As for&#10;William Dobbin, whom he had tipped repeatedly in his youth, and who had&#10;been the old gentleman's butt on a thousand occasions, old Sedley gave&#10;his hand to him in a very hesitating humble manner now, and called him&#10;&quot;Sir.&quot; A feeling of shame and remorse took possession of William Dobbin&#10;as the broken old man so received and addressed him, as if he himself&#10;had been somehow guilty of the misfortunes which had brought Sedley so&#10;low.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am very glad to see you, Captain Dobbin, sir,&quot; says he, after a&#10;skulking look or two at his visitor (whose lanky figure and military&#10;appearance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the blear eyes&#10;of the waiter in the cracked dancing pumps, and awakened the old lady&#10;in black, who dozed among the mouldy old coffee-cups in the bar).  &quot;How&#10;is the worthy alderman, and my lady, your excellent mother, sir?&quot;  He&#10;looked round at the waiter as he" />
    <node id=" marriage between Amelia and George should never take place.&#10;&#10;&quot;We must do it without,&quot; Dobbin said, smiling, and told Mr. Sedley, as&#10;he had told Mrs. Sedley in the day, before, the story of Rebecca's&#10;elopement with Captain Crawley.  It evidently amused the old gentleman.&#10;&quot;You're terrible fellows, you Captains,&quot; said he, tying up his papers;&#10;and his face wore something like a smile upon it, to the astonishment&#10;of the blear-eyed waiter who now entered, and had never seen such an&#10;expression upon Sedley's countenance since he had used the dismal&#10;coffee-house.&#10;&#10;The idea of hitting his enemy Osborne such a blow soothed, perhaps, the&#10;old gentleman: and, their colloquy presently ending, he and Dobbin&#10;parted pretty good friends.&#10;&#10;&quot;My sisters say she has diamonds as big as pigeons' eggs,&quot; George said,&#10;laughing.  &quot;How they must set off her complexion!  A perfect&#10;illumination it must be when her jewels are on her neck.  Her&#10;jet-black hair is as curly as Sambo's.  I dare say" />

My&#10;young friends Dale and Spiggot do all my business for me now, until my&#10;new offices are ready; for I'm only here temporarily, you know,&#10;Captain.  What can we do for you, sir?  Will you like to take anything?&quot;&#10;&#10;Dobbin, with a great deal of hesitation and stuttering, protested that&#10;he was not in the least hungry or thirsty; that he had no business to&#10;transact; that he only came to ask if Mr. Sedley was well, and to shake&#10;hands with an old friend; and, he added, with a desperate perversion of&#10;truth, &quot;My mother is very well--that is, she's been very unwell, and is&#10;only waiting for the first fine day to go out and call upon Mrs.&#10;Sedley" />
    <node id="s&#10;heart: and as for a marriage, he would never, never, never, never&#10;consent.&#10;&#10;&quot;They must run away together, Ma'am,&quot; Dobbin said, laughing, &quot;and&#10;follow the example of Captain Rawdon Crawley, and Miss Emmy's friend&#10;the little governess.&quot; Was it possible? Well she never!  Mrs. Sedley&#10;was all excitement about this news.  She wished that Blenkinsop were&#10;here to hear it:  Blenkinsop always mistrusted that Miss Sharp.-- What&#10;an escape Jos had had! and she described the already well-known&#10;love-passages between Rebecca and the Collector of Boggley Wollah.&#10;&#10;It was not, however, Mr. Sedley's wrath which Dobbin feared, so much as&#10;that of the other parent concerned, and he owned that he had a very&#10;considerable doubt and anxiety respecting the behaviour of the&#10;black-browed old tyrant of a Russia merchant in Russell Square.  He has&#10;forbidden the match peremptorily, Dobbin thought. He knew what a savage&#10;determined man Osborne was, and how he stuck by his word. &quot;The only&#10;chance" />

Was he anxious&#10;himself, I wonder, to have it over?--as people, when death has&#10;occurred, like to press forward the funeral, or when a parting is&#10;resolved upon, hasten it.  It is certain that Mr. Dobbin, having taken&#10;the matter in hand, was most extraordinarily eager in the conduct of&#10;it.  He urged on George the necessity of immediate action:  he showed&#10;the chances of reconciliation with his father, which a favourable&#10;mention of his name in the Gazette must bring about.  If need were he&#10;would go himself and brave both the fathers in the business.  At all&#10;events, he besought George to go through with it before the orders&#10;came, which everybody expected, for the departure of the regiment from&#10;England on foreign service.&#10;&#10;Bent upon these hymeneal projects, and with the applause and consent of&#10;Mrs. Sedley, who did not care to break the matter personally to her&#10;husband, Mr. Dobbin went to seek John Sedley at his house of call in&#10;the City, the Tapioca Coffee-house, where, since his own offices were&#10;" />

Old Osborne stood in&#10;secret terror of his son as a better gentleman than himself; and&#10;perhaps my readers may have remarked in their experience of this Vanity&#10;Fair of ours, that there is no character which a low-minded man so much&#10;mistrusts as that of a gentleman.&#10;&#10;&quot;My father didn't give me the education you have had, nor the&#10;advantages you have had, nor the money you have had.

It was unlucky, to be sure, that the lad should have&#10;secured a stock of provisions on the very day when the first encounter&#10;took place; but this relief was only temporary, old Osborne thought,&#10;and would but delay George's surrender.  No communication passed&#10;between father and son for some days.  The former was sulky at this&#10;silence, but not disquieted; for, as he said, he knew where he could&#10;put the screw upon George, and only waited the result of that&#10;operation.

    <node id="The lodgings in Greek Street where the painter Sharp and his daughter lived were likely modest and not very luxurious, given that Sharp was known to be dissolute and poor. The fact that he painted portraits of the landlady and her husband in lieu of rent suggests that he may have been behind on payments or unable to afford them. The decorative paintings of the landlady in white satin and the husband in brass buttons could indicate a certain level of familiarity and informality between Sharp and his landlords, as well as Sharp's willingness to barter his artistic skills for basic necessities like housing.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Stokes, the landlady, is described as a communicative person who quickly shared information about her tenants. She mentions that Sharp was always hunted by bailiffs and duns, which suggests that he may have had significant debts or financial troubles. Despite his personal flaws, Mrs. Stokes characterizes him as good-natured and amusing, indicating that he may have been well-liked despite his failings.&#10;&#10;Regarding Sharp's daughter, Mrs. Stokes describes her as a queer little wild vixen whose fun and mimicry kept everyone laughing. This suggests that she was lively, entertaining, and perhaps a bit mischievous. However, it is also mentioned that she kept the lodgings in Greek Street as her father's daughter, which could imply that Sharp's financial struggles may have affected her as well. Overall, the descriptions of the portraits on the walls and Mrs. Stokes's characterization of the pair provide a glimpse into their lives and personalities, suggesting a modest living situation marked by both camaraderie and financial strain." />

The&#10;friend of the Lexicographer had plenty of information to give.

Miss Crawley, on whom all Rawdon's hopes depended,&#10;still held out.  Unable to make an entry into her house in Park Lane,&#10;her affectionate nephew and niece had followed her to Brighton, where&#10;they had emissaries continually planted at her door.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you could see some of Rawdon's friends who are always about our&#10;door,&quot; Rebecca said, laughing.  &quot;Did you ever see a dun, my dear; or a&#10;bailiff and his man?

Dear little woman,&#10;you are the only person of our set who ever looked, or thought, or&#10;spoke like a lady: and you do it because you're an angel and can't help&#10;it.  Don't remonstrate.  You are the only lady. Didn't Miss Crawley&#10;remark it, who has lived in the best company in Europe?  And as for&#10;Crawley, of the Life Guards, hang it, he's a fine fellow: and I like&#10;him for marrying the girl he had chosen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia admired Mr. Crawley very much, too, for this; and trusted&#10;Rebecca would be happy with him," />

Jim's stiff college manners and&#10;poor dear Bute's talk about his dogs and horses always annoyed her.  If&#10;I took her to the Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, and fly, I&#10;know she would; and might fall into that horrid Rawdon's clutches&#10;again, and be the victim of that little viper of a Sharp.  Meanwhile,&#10;it is clear to me that she is exceedingly unwell, and cannot move for&#10;some weeks, at any rate; during which we must think of some plan to&#10;protect her from the arts of those unprincipled people.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the very best of moments, if anybody told Miss Crawley that she was,&#10;or looked ill, the trembling old lady sent off for her doctor; and I&#10;daresay she was very unwell after the sudden family event, which might&#10;serve to shake stronger nerves than hers.

Glad you're come&#10;down. Emmy'll be delighted to see you,&quot; Osborne said, shaking his&#10;comrade warmly by the hand as soon as his descent from the vehicle was&#10;effected--and then he added, in a lower and agitated voice, &quot;What's the&#10;news?

A much harder heart than&#10;George's would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly&#10;ravaged by grief and despair, and at the simple tender accents in which&#10;she told her little broken-hearted story: but as she did not faint when&#10;her mother, trembling, brought Osborne to her; and as she only gave&#10;relief to her overcharged grief, by laying her head on her lover's&#10;shoulder and there weeping for a while the most tender, copious, and&#10;refreshing tears--old Mrs. Sedley, too greatly relieved, thought it was&#10;best to" />

No. Everybody in&#10;Vanity Fair must have remarked how well those live who are comfortably&#10;and thoroughly in debt: how they deny themselves nothing; how jolly and&#10;easy they are in their minds.

    <node id="The text suggests that public success and glory may not always bring happiness or contentment in an individual's private life. When people are faced with sickness, regret, or contemplation, they might realize that their past achievements and pleasures do not hold much value anymore. The bustle, triumph, laughter, and gaiety exhibited in public may not follow the performer into their private life, and reminiscences of past successes may not console them during difficult times. Instead, such moments might lead to dismal repentances or a depressed state of mind. This is because wealth, fair repute, and social status are considered the chiefest goods in Vanity Fair, and people's affections tend to awaken spontaneously towards those who possess these qualities. However, not all relationships with wealthy individuals end well, as some may take advantage of one's kindness and goodwill, leading to disappointment or betrayal. Ultimately, the text highlights that public success and glory can have a significant impact on an individual's private life, especially during moments of introspection or contemplation, and it is essential to maintain a balance between one's public persona and private self." />

But,&#10;without preaching, the truth may surely be borne in mind, that the&#10;bustle, and triumph, and laughter, and gaiety which Vanity Fair&#10;exhibits in public, do not always pursue the performer into private&#10;life, and that the most dreary depression of spirits and dismal&#10;repentances sometimes overcome him.

    <node id="Mrs. Bute Crawley, sister-in-law to Rawdon Crawley, is portrayed as making significant efforts to persuade her sister-in-law to end her relationship with Rawdon. She does this by pointing out Rawdon's &quot;manifold sins&quot; and providing a detailed catalogue of his past misdeeds, including an ugly quarrel with Captain Marker and his shooting of the Captain, as well as other unspecified errors. Mrs. Bute Crawley is described as being particularly eager to point out her nephew's wrongdoings and believes it to be her duty as a Christian woman and mother to do so. She also criticizes Rebecca's character, who is now a relative through her marriage to Rawdon.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley's efforts are not limited to verbal criticism, as she also takes action by visiting Miss Pinkerton, a friend of Miss Crawley, in order to gather more information about Rebecca and further turn Miss Crawley against her nephew.

If a man has committed&#10;wrong in life, I don't know any moralist more anxious to point his&#10;errors out to the world than his own relations; so Mrs. Bute showed a&#10;perfect family interest and knowledge of Rawdon's history.

Yes, if a man's character is to&#10;be abused, say what you will, there's nobody like a relation to do the&#10;business.  And one is bound to own, regarding this unfortunate wretch&#10;of a Rawdon Crawley, that the mere truth was enough to condemn him, and&#10;that all inventions of scandal were quite superfluous pains on his&#10;friends' parts.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, too, being now a relative, came in for the fullest share of&#10;Mrs. Bute's kind inquiries.

She knew Rebecca to be too clever and&#10;spirited and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle; and felt&#10;that she must prepare for that combat, and be incessantly watchful&#10;against assault; or mine, or surprise.&#10;&#10;In the first place, though she held the town, was she sure of the&#10;principal inhabitant?  Would Miss Crawley herself hold out; and had she&#10;not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted adversary?  The old&#10;lady liked Rawdon, and Rebecca, who amused her.  Mrs. Bute could not&#10;disguise from herself the fact that none of her party could so&#10;contribute to the pleasures of the town-bred lady.  &quot;My girls' singing,&#10;after that little odious governess's, I know is unbearable,&quot; the candid" />

Arranging George's return: When George Osborne was severely wounded during the Battle of Waterloo, Dobbin took it upon himself to bring George back to Amelia, knowing that she would be devastated if her husband failed to return.&#10;2. Facilitating their reconciliation: After George's return, Dobbin intervened and helped rekindle the love between Amelia and George by reminding them of their strong bond. He did this even though he himself had feelings for Amelia.&#10;3. Providing financial support: Dobbin offered to financially support Amelia and her family when Mr. Sedley faced severe financial difficulties, ensuring they would not fall into extreme poverty.&#10;4. Distracting the Sedleys from their anger: By sharing the news of Rebecca's elopement with Crawley, Dobbin successfully shifted the focus of the Sedleys from their anger towards George to this new scandal, making it easier for Amelia and George to reconcile.&#10;5. Supporting their marriage: When Mr. and Mrs. Sedley initially opposed a marriage between Amelia and George due to financial constraints, Dobbin suggested they proceed with the wedding without the dowry. He also assured them that their married life would be happy and fulfilling regardless of material wealth.&#10;&#10;Throughout the narrative, Dobbin consistently goes out of his way to ensure Amelia's well-being and happiness, demonstrating his deep empathy and care for her." />

This advice prevailing over the stables and the jelly,&#10;they turned towards the coach-office to witness the Lightning's arrival.&#10;&#10;As they passed, they met the carriage--Jos Sedley's open carriage, with&#10;its magnificent armorial bearings--that splendid conveyance in which he&#10;used to drive, about at Cheltenham, majestic and solitary, with his&#10;arms folded, and his hat cocked; or, more happy, with ladies by his&#10;side.&#10;&#10;Two were in the carriage now: one a little person, with light hair, and&#10;dressed in the height of the fashion; the other in a brown silk&#10;pelisse, and a straw bonnet with pink ribbons, with a rosy, round,&#10;happy face, that did you good to behold.

He sported a military frock-coat, ornamented with frogs,&#10;knobs, black buttons, and meandering embroidery. He had affected a&#10;military appearance and habits of late; and he walked with his two&#10;friends, who were of that profession, clinking his boot-spurs,&#10;swaggering prodigiously, and shooting death-glances at all the servant&#10;girls who were worthy to be slain.&#10;&#10;&quot;What shall we do, boys, till the ladies return?&quot; the buck asked. The&#10;ladies were out to Rottingdean in his carriage on a drive.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let's have a game at billiards,&quot; one of his friends said--the tall&#10;one, with lacquered mustachios.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, dammy; no, Captain,&quot; Jos replied, rather alarmed.  &quot;No billiards&#10;to-day, Crawley, my boy" />
    <node id="1. The narrator suggests that human relationships and feelings can change significantly over time, making old letters and documents awkward or even painful to revisit. They believe that the best ink for use in Vanity Fair (a metaphorical place representing society) would be one that fades quickly, allowing people to start anew without the weight of past promises.&#10;2. The described law would require the destruction of all written documents, except receipted tradesmen's bills, after a short interval. This means that personal correspondence, love letters, and other sensitive records would self-destruct after a certain period. Indelible ink inventors would be made extinct to ensure this law's enforcement.&#10;3. If such a law existed in Vanity Fair, it could prevent situations like George Osborne's father insisting that his son marry Miss Swartz for her money, as any agreement or engagement would fade and become unreadable after the allotted time. This could help minimize long-term consequences from hasty decisions made in the past based on changing emotions and circumstances.&#10;4. However, it is important to note that destroying written records may also lead to the loss of valuable information, historical context, and evidence of wrongdoing. A balance should be struck between allowing personal growth and maintaining accountability for past actions and commitments." />
    <node id=".  Perhaps in Vanity Fair there are no&#10;better satires than letters.  Take a bundle of your dear friend's of&#10;ten years back--your dear friend whom you hate now.

Get down the round-hand scrawls of your son&#10;who has half broken your heart with selfish undutifulness since; or a&#10;parcel of your own, breathing endless ardour and love eternal, which&#10;were sent back by your mistress when she married the Nabob--your&#10;mistress for whom you now care no more than for Queen Elizabeth. Vows,&#10;love, promises, confidences, gratitude, how queerly they read after a&#10;while!  There ought to be a law in Vanity Fair ordering the destruction&#10;of every written document (except receipted tradesmen's bills) after a&#10;certain brief and proper interval.  Those quacks and misanthropes who&#10;advertise indelible Japan ink should be made to perish along with their&#10;wicked discoveries.

    <node id="1. Excessive stress and anxiety: Prudent Mrs. Bute's constant presence and attempts to persuade Miss Crawley to change her will may cause significant psychological stress, which can exacerbate Miss Crawley's nervousness and potentially lead to more serious health issues such as &quot;apoplexy.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Overstrained authority: Women who order everything for everybody, like Mrs. Bute, don't always consider the possibility of a domestic revolt or extreme consequences resulting from their authoritarian management style. This can cause resentment and an inclination to escape from such a restrictive environment.&#10;&#10;3. Deterioration of health: In trying to manage Miss Crawley's household too well, Mrs. Bute may be sacrificing her own health due to the physical demands of caring for an invalid. This could further contribute to the tension and stress within the household.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of mental stimulation: The other members of Miss Crawley's household cannot provide the same level of entertainment as Rawdon and Rebecca, who amuse the old lady. By focusing solely on turning Miss Crawley against her nephew and his wife, Mrs. Bute may be inadvertently depriving her of much-needed mental stimulation and social interaction.&#10;&#10;5. Illness: The pressure of Mrs. Bute's constant presence and relentless attempts to persuade Miss Crawley ultimately lead to the old lady becoming ill and feeling harassed by the situation. This undermines the original intention of improving Miss Crawley's well-being through her management.&#10;&#10;6. Failure to achieve objectives: Despite Mrs. Bute's overly eager and efficient efforts, she is ultimately unsuccessful in ending Rawdon and Rebecca's relationship, as their bond proves too strong for her interventions." />
    <node id="Mr. Sedley gives strong negative hints about George's courtship of Amelia by publicly expressing his disapproval, forbidding the match, and voicing derogatory opinions about the Osborne family. These hints contribute to straining George's relationship with Amelia, making him more susceptible to the idea of pursuing a fortune-based marriage with the heiress Miss Swartz.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sedley is against his daughter Amelia marrying George primarily due to his negative opinions about George's family, particularly George's father. Mr. Sedley accuses George's father of being a &quot;villain&quot; and states that he would &quot;rather see my daughter dead at my feet than married to him.&quot; These strong words make it clear to George that there is no room for compromise or reconciliation regarding this matter.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mr. Sedley forbids the match between Amelia and George by stating, &quot;the Sedley family and Osborne family are separated forever.&quot; This unequivocal statement further alienates George from Amelia and forces him to consider other options, such as marrying Miss Swartz for her significant fortune and connections.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Sedley acknowledges his role in the affair by recognizing that he played with the young people's feelings and ultimately broke their hearts by forbidding the match. This admission highlights the impact of Mr. Sedley's negative hints on George's feelings and actions regarding his courtship of Amelia, as it contributes to making the relationship untenable.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Mr. Sedley gives unambiguous negative hints about George's courtship of Amelia by publicly expressing his disapproval, forbidding the match, and voicing derogatory opinions about the Osborne family. These hints lead George to reconsider his relationship with Amelia and become more amenable to the idea of pursuing a marriage with Miss Swartz for her wealth and social status." />

He accuses George's father of being a &quot;villain&quot; and states that he would &quot;rather see my daughter dead at my feet than married to him.&quot; Mr. Sedley feels that he has been wronged by George's father, which has caused him financial difficulties, and does not want the Osborne and Sedley families to be connected through marriage.&#10;&#10;Regarding his own role in Amelia and George's affair, Mr. Sedley acknowledges that it was his fault as much as George's for allowing their affections to grow. He recognizes that he played with their feelings and ultimately broke their hearts by forbidding the match. Mr. Sedley's negative hints about George's courtship of Amelia, such as publicly expressing his disapproval, forbidding the match, and voicing derogatory opinions about the Osborne family, contribute to straining George's relationship with Amelia and making him more susceptible to pursuing a fortune-based marriage with Miss Swartz." />
    <node id="When Mr. Sedley refers to giving &quot;hints&quot; to his son George regarding marrying the heiress, he means that he has been dropping subtle suggestions or signals for George to consider marrying a wealthy woman, Miss Swartz, instead of Amelia. These hints are likely indirect and non-confrontational attempts from Mr. Sedley to steer George away from Amelia due to his disapproval of the Osborne family and financial difficulties. By encouraging George to pursue a fortune-based marriage with Miss Swartz, Mr. Sedley hopes to protect his own family's interests and prevent any connection between the Sedleys and the Osbornes." />
    <node id="George Osborne holds a favorable view of Amelia (&quot;Emmy&quot;) compared to her sisters. He finds her behavior more elegant and refined, appreciating her tender voice, humble movements, and modest graces. In contrast, he sees her sisters as shrill, with attitudes and elbows, and starch. When describing Miss Swartz, George likens her to a China doll, emphasizing the stark contrast between the two women. He also mentions that Amelia's simple dress is more becoming than anything her sisters have ever seen.&#10;&#10;This comparison in George's mind affects his behavior towards Amelia. Despite her father's disapproval and forbidding their match, George continues to pursue Amelia because of his positive perception of her. He develops a deeper affection for Emmy due to her qualities, which strengthens his desire to marry her despite the challenges. However, when faced with financial difficulties and potential disinheritance if he marries Amelia, George considers other options, including Miss Swartz, who represents wealth and social status. Ultimately, George's fondness for Emmy remains strong throughout the narrative, even as external factors affect their relationship." />

He contrasted their behaviour with little Emmy's--their&#10;shrill voices with her tender ringing tones; their attitudes and their&#10;elbows and their starch, with her humble soft movements and modest&#10;graces.  Poor Swartz was seated in a place where Emmy had been&#10;accustomed to sit. Her bejewelled hands lay sprawling in her amber&#10;satin lap.  Her tags and ear-rings twinkled, and her big eyes rolled&#10;about.  She was doing nothing with perfect contentment, and thinking&#10;herself charming.  Anything so becoming as the satin the sisters had&#10;never seen.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dammy,&quot; George said to a confidential friend, &quot;she looked like a China&#10;doll, which has nothing to do all day but to grin and wag its head.

She's&#10;related to every one, that Haggistoun.  Her diamonds blazed out like&#10;Vauxhall on the night we were there.  (Do you remember Vauxhall, Emmy,&#10;and Jos singing to his dearest diddle diddle darling?)  Diamonds and&#10;mahogany, my dear! think what an advantageous contrast--and the white&#10;feathers in her hair--I mean in her wool.  She had earrings like&#10;chandeliers; you might have lighted 'em up, by Jove--and a yellow satin&#10;train that streeled after her like the tail of a comet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How old is she?&quot; asked Emmy" />
    <node id="Mr. Osborne encouraging his daughters' attachment to Miss Swartz, the heiress, signifies his desire to secure a prosperous future for his family through this advantageous marriage. As a father, he might find pleasure in this situation due to several reasons. Firstly, Miss Swartz's significant fortune would provide financial security and elevate the social status of the Osborne family. Secondly, by marrying into a wealthy family, Mr. Osborne can ensure that his daughters will have access to all the luxuries and comforts in life, which he may perceive as fulfilling his paternal duties. Lastly, given the disapproval of George's relationship with Amelia Sedley and the financial difficulties faced by the Sedley family, Mr. Osborne might view marrying Miss Swartz as a way to protect his own family's interests and prevent any connection between the Sedleys and the Osbornes." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the elder Osborne wanted George to remember that he was the master of the house and George should respect his authority. This includes using appropriate language when communicating with his father, as the elder Osborne felt intimidated by George's haughty demeanor, which stemmed from his education, advantages, and money. The father also wanted to remind George of his own contributions in providing opportunities for George and the family, implying that George should not look down on him or boast about his superiority. The conversation highlights a power dynamic between father and son and potential conflicts arising from their different social statuses and expectations for George's future." />

Awful and pleasing notion of Wealth: The text suggests that there is something awful and pleasing about wealth that naturally attracts people, even members of the British public, to it. This fascination is so strong that they cannot help but look at a wealthy person with interest.&#10;&#10;2. Affection for the wealthy: Old worldlings, in particular, are prone to having their affections rush out to meet and welcome money. Their kind sentiments awaken spontaneously towards the interesting possessors of it. This inclination is so strong that some respectable people don't consider themselves at liberty to indulge in friendship with anyone who doesn't have a certain competency or place in society.&#10;&#10;3. People in Vanity Fair: In this social context, money and fair repute are considered the chiefest good. Therefore, those who possess wealth and prosperity are admired and sought after, while those who lack these qualities are pitied. The text highlights that people in Vanity Fair are particularly drawn to wealth and the status it brings.&#10;&#10;4. Vipers and beggars: However, the text also acknowledges that not all relationships with wealthy individuals end well. There are some who may take advantage of one's kindness and goodwill, only to later mistreat or betray them.

He believed that her constant presence and attempts to persuade Miss Crawley to change her will were causing stress and anxiety, which could exacerbate Miss Crawley's nervousness and potentially lead to more serious health issues such as &quot;apoplexy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Clump expressed his concerns to Mrs. Bute Crawley by advising her that she should encourage Miss Crawley to leave her bedroom and engage in activities like taking little drives, which would provide change, fresh air, and gaiety. He also suggested that this would help improve Mrs. Bute Crawley's own health as well.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley responded to Mr. Clump's remarks by expressing her commitment to her duty as a family member, drawing a comparison to when she nursed her own son during his illness. She emphasized that she would never abandon Miss Crawley and viewed her role as not only a medical necessity but also a spiritual one.&#10;&#10;Mr. Clump, in turn, responded by acknowledging Mrs. Bute Crawley's dedication while subtly hinting at the need for Miss Crawley to have exposure to activities that could help improve her mental state and overall well-being.">

The fact that he painted portraits of the landlady and her husband in lieu of rent suggests that he may have been behind on payments or unable to afford them. The decorative paintings of the landlady in white satin and the husband in brass buttons could indicate a certain level of familiarity and informality between Sharp and his landlords, as well as Sharp's willingness to barter his artistic skills for basic necessities like housing.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Stokes, the landlady, is described as a communicative person who quickly shared information about her tenants. She mentions that Sharp was always hunted by bailiffs and duns, which suggests that he may have had significant debts or financial troubles. Despite his personal flaws, Mrs. Stokes characterizes him as good-natured and amusing, indicating that he may have been well-liked despite his failings.&#10;&#10;Regarding Sharp's daughter, Mrs. Stokes describes her as a queer little wild vixen whose fun and mimicry kept everyone laughing. This suggests that she was lively, entertaining, and perhaps a bit mischievous. However, it is also mentioned that she kept the lodgings in Greek Street as her father's daughter, which could imply that Sharp's financial struggles may have affected her as well. Overall, the descriptions of the portraits on the walls and Mrs. Stokes's characterization of the pair provide a glimpse into their lives and personalities, suggesting a modest living situation marked by both camaraderie and financial strain.">

The revelation of Rebecca's elopement distracts the Sedleys from their anger towards George and allows them to focus on this new scandal instead, making it easier for George and Amelia to reconcile and proceed with their marriage.">

Facilitating their reconciliation: After George's return, Dobbin intervened and helped rekindle the love between Amelia and George by reminding them of their strong bond. He did this even though he himself had feelings for Amelia.&#10;3. Providing financial support: Dobbin offered to financially support Amelia and her family when Mr. Sedley faced severe financial difficulties, ensuring they would not fall into extreme poverty.&#10;4. Distracting the Sedleys from their anger: By sharing the news of Rebecca's elopement with Crawley, Dobbin successfully shifted the focus of the Sedleys from their anger towards George to this new scandal, making it easier for Amelia and George to reconcile.&#10;5. Supporting their marriage: When Mr. and Mrs. Sedley initially opposed a marriage between Amelia and George due to financial constraints, Dobbin suggested they proceed with the wedding without the dowry. He also assured them that their married life would be happy and fulfilling regardless of material wealth.&#10;&#10;Throughout the narrative, Dobbin consistently goes out of his way to ensure Amelia's well-being and happiness, demonstrating his deep empathy and care for her.">

When people are faced with sickness, regret, or contemplation, they might realize that their past achievements and pleasures do not hold much value anymore. The bustle, triumph, laughter, and gaiety exhibited in public may not follow the performer into their private life, and reminiscences of past successes may not console them during difficult times. Instead, such moments might lead to dismal repentances or a depressed state of mind. This is because wealth, fair repute, and social status are considered the chiefest goods in Vanity Fair, and people's affections tend to awaken spontaneously towards those who possess these qualities. However, not all relationships with wealthy individuals end well, as some may take advantage of one's kindness and goodwill, leading to disappointment or betrayal. Ultimately, the text highlights that public success and glory can have a significant impact on an individual's private life, especially during moments of introspection or contemplation, and it is essential to maintain a balance between one's public persona and private self.">

The described law would require the destruction of all written documents, except receipted tradesmen's bills, after a short interval. This means that personal correspondence, love letters, and other sensitive records would self-destruct after a certain period. Indelible ink inventors would be made extinct to ensure this law's enforcement.&#10;3. If such a law existed in Vanity Fair, it could prevent situations like George Osborne's father insisting that his son marry Miss Swartz for her money, as any agreement or engagement would fade and become unreadable after the allotted time. This could help minimize long-term consequences from hasty decisions made in the past based on changing emotions and circumstances.&#10;4. However, it is important to note that destroying written records may also lead to the loss of valuable information, historical context, and evidence of wrongdoing. A balance should be struck between allowing personal growth and maintaining accountability for past actions and commitments.">

The ceremony took place in a nearly empty church, with only the officiating persons, the small marriage party, and their attendants present. This included George, Amelia, Amelia's mother Mrs. Sedley, her brother Jos Sedley, who gave away the bride, and Captain William Dobbin, who served as groomsman to his friend George.&#10;&#10;The two valets of George and Amelia sat aloof superciliously, and the rain came rattling down on the windows during the service. The parson's tones echoed sadly through the empty walls, and Emmy's response to her vows was barely heard by anyone except Captain Dobbin.&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley kissed his sister for the first time in many months after the service, and George seemed proud and radiant. William Dobbin went up and touched Amelia on the cheek, with a look of pride and happiness. The newlyweds then signed the register and departed for their carriage.&#10;&#10;The reason for the small wedding was not only due to Mr. Sedley's death but also because Mr. Sedley had been against the marriage due to his dislike for George's father, whom he considered a &quot;stiff-backed prig&quot; with &quot;dandified airs and West End swagger.&quot; However, Captain Dobbin played a significant role in facilitating the wedding by convincing Mr. Sedley that it would be Amelia's duty to marry George without his consent if necessary, as she had already considered herself married to him.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the wedding of George Osborne and Amelia Sedley was a solemn and quiet affair, but filled with love and happiness for the newlyweds, who were finally able to start their life together despite the obstacles they faced.">

When people are faced with sickness, regret, or contemplation, they might realize that their past achievements and pleasures do not hold much value anymore. The bustle, triumph, laughter, and gaiety exhibited in public may not follow the performer into their private life, and reminiscences of past successes may not console them during difficult times. Instead, such moments might lead to dismal repentances or a depressed state of mind. This is because wealth, fair repute, and social status are considered the chiefest goods in Vanity Fair, and people's affections tend to awaken spontaneously towards those who possess these qualities. However, not all relationships with wealthy individuals end well, as some may take advantage of one's kindness and goodwill, leading to disappointment or betrayal. Ultimately, the text highlights that public success and glory can have a significant impact on an individual's private life, especially during moments of introspection or contemplation, and it is essential to maintain a balance between one's public persona and private self.">

If such a law existed in Vanity Fair, it could prevent situations like George Osborne's father insisting that his son marry Miss Swartz for her money, as any agreement or engagement would fade and become unreadable after the allotted time. This could help minimize long-term consequences from hasty decisions made in the past based on changing emotions and circumstances.&#10;4.

The ceremony took place in a nearly empty church, with only the officiating persons, the small marriage party, and their attendants present. This included George, Amelia, Amelia's mother Mrs. Sedley, her brother Jos Sedley, who gave away the bride, and Captain William Dobbin, who served as groomsman to his friend George.&#10;&#10;The two valets of George and Amelia sat aloof superciliously, and the rain came rattling down on the windows during the service.

Facilitating their reconciliation: After George's return, Dobbin intervened and helped rekindle the love between Amelia and George by reminding them of their strong bond. He did this even though he himself had feelings for Amelia.&#10;3. Providing financial support: Dobbin offered to financially support Amelia and her family when Mr. Sedley faced severe financial difficulties, ensuring they would not fall into extreme poverty.&#10;4. Distracting the Sedleys from their anger: By sharing the news of Rebecca's elopement with Crawley, Dobbin successfully shifted the focus of the Sedleys from their anger towards George to this new scandal, making it easier for Amelia and George to reconcile.&#10;5. Supporting their marriage: When Mr. and Mrs. Sedley initially opposed a marriage between Amelia and George due to financial constraints, Dobbin suggested they proceed with the wedding without the dowry. He also assured them that their married life would be happy and fulfilling regardless of material wealth.&#10;&#10;Throughout the narrative, Dobbin consistently goes out of his way to ensure Amelia's well-being and happiness, demonstrating his deep empathy and care for her.">

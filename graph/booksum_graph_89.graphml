    <node id="Mr. Elder, Dave Dyer, and Dr. Kennicott have a negative view of college professors and other individuals trying to tell businessmen how to run their businesses. They believe it is an attack on the integrity of American industry and that these individuals are socialists in disguise. They are opposed to this interference and consider it their duty as producers to resist such attacks.&#10;&#10;The conversation on this topic continued with them discussing the justice of the peace and whether he had sent a hobo to jail for ten days or twelve. Dave Dyer then shared his carefree adventures on the gipsy trail, and when asked about complications in the labor situation, they expressed their belief that it is simple - workers either like what they are paid or they can leave. They did not show interest in topics such as profit-sharing and considered such ideas to be poppycock." />

Don't you think so, doc?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You bet,&quot; agreed Kennicott.&#10;&#10;The conversation was at last relieved of the plague of Carol's&#10;intrusions and they settled down to the question of whether the justice&#10;of the peace had sent that hobo drunk to jail for ten days or twelve.&#10;It was a matter not readily determined.

Him and his wife are good sports--him and Sam&#10;and I go hunting together a lot. The old cheese there is Luke Dawson,&#10;the richest man in town. Next to him is Nat Hicks, the tailor.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Really? A tailor?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sure. Why not? Maybe we're slow, but we are democratic. I go hunting&#10;with Nat same as I do with Jack Elder.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm glad. I've never met a tailor socially. It must be charming to meet&#10;one and not have to think about what you owe him.

She asserted that she was going&#10;to stage a musical comedy, that she preferred cafe parfait to beefsteak,&#10;that she hoped Dr. Kennicott would never lose his ability to make love&#10;to charming women, and that she had a pair of gold stockings. They gaped&#10;for more. But she could not keep it up. She retired to a chair behind&#10;Sam Clark's bulk.

She remembered visions of herself as a smart married woman in&#10;a drawing-room, fencing with clever men. Her dejection was relieved by&#10;speculation as to what the men were discussing, in the corner between&#10;the piano and the phonograph. Did they rise from these housewifely&#10;personalities to a larger world of abstractions and affairs?&#10;&#10;She made her best curtsy to Mrs. Dawson; she twittered, &quot;I won't have my&#10;husband leaving me so soon! I'm going over and pull the wretch's&#10;ears.&quot; She rose with a jeune fille bow. She was self-absorbed and&#10;self-approving because she had attained that quality of sentimentality.&#10;She proudly dipped across the room and, to the interest and commendation&#10;of all beholders, sat on the arm of Kennicott's chair.&#10;&#10;He was gossiping with Sam Clark, Luke Dawson, Jackson Elder of the&#10;planing-mill, Chet Dashaway, Dave Dyer, Harry" />

Of course, if they have loans you can&#10;make 'em listen to reason. I just have 'em come into the bank for a&#10;talk, and tell 'em a few things.

    <node id="The crowd was very welcoming and appreciative of Carol, the speaker's significant other. They praised her by saying that she was quick and bright, and they were impressed by her intelligence and wit. However, Carol found it hard to appreciate their praise because she was feeling self-conscious and insecure. She had hoped to be seen as a sophisticated and charming married woman, but instead, she felt like she was being left out of the men's conversations and reduced to talking about trivial matters with the other women. When she received praise from her husband and the crowd, she was too absorbed in her own self-pity and disappointment to fully enjoy it. Additionally, the cheering group made her feel embarrassed, but their warmth and affection eventually won her over, and she stammered her thanks to them." />

Carol tries to liven up the party by taking on a more outgoing and assertive personality than she normally would. She intentionally stirs things up by making bold statements and sharing personal details about herself, such as her interest in modern educational systems and her possession of gold stockings. However, she eventually tires from maintaining this facade and steps back to listen to the conversation, discovering that meaningful dialogue is indeed lacking in Gopher Prairie." />

While he droned, his brows popped up and down.

    <node id="Carol's reluctance to shake hands with an undertaker, but not with a great surgeon, can be explained by the social perceptions and connotations associated with each profession. Historically, surgeons have been seen as highly respected medical professionals who save lives, while undertakers are associated with death and mourning. This societal bias may cause Carol to feel more comfortable interacting with a surgeon, who represents the scientific and curative aspects of dealing with the human body, than an undertaker, who is linked to the finality and sadness of death. It's important to note that this distinction highlights the social attitudes towards these professions during the time the story was written." />

    <node id="The individuals in the narrative, particularly Mr. Elder, Dave Dyer, and Dr. Kennicott, have a negative view of certain labor-related concepts such as profit-sharing, welfare work, insurance, and old-age pension. They believe that these ideas enfeeble a worker's independence and waste honest profit. They see them as unnecessary complications and &quot;poppycock&quot; introduced by half-baked thinkers, college professors, and suffragettes. They prefer to handle labor disputes directly, man to man, and are opposed to outside interference in their businesses, such as that from union leaders who they view as rich grafters exploiting ignorant workers. They value freedom and constitutional rights, and believe that if a worker doesn't like their shop, he can leave, and vice versa." />

    <node id="Based on the description provided in the narrative, Schoenstrom is a small town of perhaps 150 inhabitants. The business center of the town takes up one side of one block, facing the railroad. It consists of a row of one-story shops covered with either galvanized iron or clapboards painted red and bilious yellow. The buildings are described as ill-assorted and temporary-looking, similar to a mining-camp street in the motion-pictures. The railroad station is a one-room frame box, with a mirey cattle-pen on one side and a crimson wheat-elevator on the other. The only habitable structures to be seen are the florid red-brick Catholic church and rectory at the end of Main Street.&#10;&#10;The town appears to be rather run-down, with buildings that look like shacks. There is also mention of a &quot;desert stillness&quot; at the train station. The town's main source of entertainment seems to be the movies, which the farmers can reach more quickly by car than they could by trolley in a city.&#10;&#10;Overall, Schoenstrom is described as a small and rural town, with buildings that are in need of repair and modernization. It is also a town where farming and agriculture are important industries." />

She finds herself unable to believe that she has slept in his arms and wonders how they could have ever shared any adventures or excitement together.&#10;2. Carol's thoughts on Kennicott are mixed.

Moreover, she feels that they have little in common and that there is no magic or excitement between them anymore. She begins to question the wisdom of her decision to marry him and move to Gopher Prairie, feeling increasingly uncertain about her future in this small town." />

    <node id="The house being referred to in the narrative is the Candersen place that Sam Clark is trying to sell to the narrator's husband, Dr. Kennicott. According to Clark, it is a old house that he is willing to sell for three thousand dollars.

The fact that Clark describes the house as &quot;this junk-heap&quot; also suggests that it may be in need of significant repairs or upgrades.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the narrator's reaction to the town of Gopher Prairie, where the house is located, indicates that she may not be excited about moving there. She describes the town as a &quot;junk-heap&quot; and expresses her reluctance to go through with the move.

The setting is hot and dusty, and the train itself is not luxurious, with no porters, pillows, or provisions for beds. The passengers come from different backgrounds, including farmers, workmen, and traveling salesmen. They all seem tired, parched, and cramped, waiting for their destination.&#10;&#10;A woman feeds her baby a graham cracker, but most of the crumbs fall on the seat, and she tries to clean them up unsuccessfully. A soiled man and woman eat sandwiches and throw the crusts on the floor. A large Norwegian takes off his shoes and props his feet on the seat in front of him. An old woman anxiously checks her bag multiple times, which contains personal treasures and memories.

An early-wrinkled, young-old mother, moving as though her joints&#10;were dry, opens a suit-case in which are seen creased blouses, a pair&#10;of slippers worn through at the toes, a bottle of patent medicine, a tin&#10;cup, a paper-covered book about dreams which the news-butcher has coaxed&#10;her into buying.

Why, it had three thousand&#10;population. That was a great many people. There would be six hundred&#10;houses or more. And----The lakes near it would be so lovely.

She is also a bit of an outsider who feels disconnected from the people around her. This is evident in her inability to distinguish the eyes of the other party-goers and seeing them as a &quot;blurry theater-audience.&quot;&#10;3. Despite her insecurities, Carol values her relationship with Doc Kennicott and appreciates his love and support. She expresses relief and happiness in being cherished by him despite how she felt about her own performance during the event.&#10;4. Carol has a desire for excitement and adventure, as evidenced by her descriptions of their Colorado trip where she leaped from peak to peak and encouraged her husband to go swimming in icy waters. This contrasts with the mundane and unremarkable nature of Gopher Prairie, further fueling her feelings of self-consciousness and unease.&#10;5. She has a sense of humor and is not afraid to make fun of herself or poke gentle fun at her husband's expense.

Carol finds the town of Gopher Prairie unattractive and unplanned, with no consideration for aesthetics in its buildings.

Carol feels uneasy about this move, as she has just realized that Gopher Prairie is the very next town on their route. She begins to feel trapped and terrified at the thought of living in this small, unremarkable town, and also starts questioning her relationship with Will. Despite these fears, she decides to trust Will and make the best of the situation, vowing to do tremendous things for herself and the people around her." />

And she was&#10;going to do tremendous things----&#10;&#10;She followed Kennicott and the bobbing ends of the two bags which&#10;he carried. They were held back by the slow line of disembarking&#10;passengers. She reminded herself that she was actually at the dramatic&#10;moment of the bride's home-coming. She ought to feel exalted.

She exaggerates this innocent gesture and teases him by saying he is a &quot;heart-breaker&quot; in front of the other party guests. This lighthearted moment leads to Mr. Dawson being called a &quot;heart-breaker&quot; for the first time, much to everyone's amusement." />

Carol saw that George Edwin Mott and the blanched Mr. and&#10;Mrs. Dawson were not yet hypnotized. They looked as though they wondered&#10;whether they ought to look as though they disapproved. She concentrated&#10;on them:&#10;&#10;&quot;But I know whom I wouldn't have dared to go to Colorado with! Mr.&#10;Dawson there! I'm sure he's a regular heart-breaker. When we were&#10;introduced he held my hand and squeezed it frightfully.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Haw! Haw! Haw!&quot; The entire company applauded.

    <node id="1. The buildings in Gopher Prairie are described as unattractive and unplanned, with no consideration for aesthetics. This lack of planning and design is reflected in the random placement of structures and the absence of any cohesive architectural style.&#10;2. Carol, the main character, feels both invisible and conspicuous in Gopher Prairie. She is unimpressed by its lack of planning and aesthetics and begins to question her relationship with Kennicott. The sight of even smaller towns like Schoenstrom further solidifies her disappointment.&#10;3. In contrast, Kennicott has a more positive view of Gopher Prairie. He excitedly points out the &quot;great lawns and trees&quot; to Carol when they first arrive, indicating his appreciation for the natural beauty of the town. However, it is clear that Carol's perspective on Gopher Prairie is significantly less favorable than Kennicott's, highlighting their differing viewpoints and values." />
    <node id="Based on the description provided in the narrative, Schoenstrom is a small and rural town with a population of perhaps 150 inhabitants. The business center of the town takes up one side of one block, facing the railroad. It consists of a row of one-story shops covered with either galvanized iron or clapboards painted red and bilious yellow. The buildings are described as ill-assorted and temporary-looking, similar to a mining-camp street in the motion-pictures.&#10;&#10;The saloons in Schoenstrom are described as having a stale beer smell and thick voices bellowing pidgin German or trolling out dirty songs. The atmosphere is described as vice gone feeble and unenterprising, with farmwives waiting for their husbands to become drunk.&#10;&#10;The shops on Main Street include a tobacco shop called &quot;The Smoke House,&quot; filled with young men shaking dice for cigarettes and racks of magazines, and pictures of coy fat prostitutes in striped bathing-suits. A clothing store has a display of &quot;ox-blood-shade Oxfords with bull-dog toes&quot; and suits that look worn and glossless while they are still new. The Bon Ton Store is the largest shop in town, with a first-story front of clear glass and one window of excellent clothes for men interspersed with collars of floral pique which showed mauve.&#10;&#10;The residents of Schoenstrom are described as being indifferent to Carol's presence, and they are more observant than she gives them credit for. The only habitable structures to be seen are the florid red-brick Catholic church and rectory at the end of Main Street.&#10;&#10;In summary, the atmosphere in Schoenstrom is one of a small and rural town with a run-down business center, unremarkable saloons, and shops that offer limited selections. The residents are described as being indifferent to outsiders, but observant of their surroundings. The clothing store window display is lackluster, with suits that look worn even when new and floral pique collars that show mauve." />
    <node id="1. Disappointment with the town's appearance: Carol is disappointed with the unattractive and unplanned buildings in Gopher Prairie. She notices the lack of consideration for aesthetics, with structures placed randomly and no cohesive architectural style. This further solidifies her disappointment when she sees an even smaller and less remarkable town like Schoenstrom.&#10;2. Disillusionment with marriage: Carol is disenchanted with the reality of marriage compared to the stories she has heard. She feels that she has been misled about the joys of married life, as evidenced by her statement, &quot;Lies about marriage. I'm NOT changed.&quot; She also begins to question her decision to marry Kennicott and move to Gopher Prairie, feeling unsure about her future in this small town.&#10;3. Feeling like a stranger: Carol feels trapped and terrified at the thought of living in Gopher Prairie with Kennicott, whom she now sees as a stranger. She is unable to believe that she has shared adventures or excitement with him, highlighting their differing viewpoints and values. Despite his good qualities, such as being dependable and kind, she feels there is no magic between them anymore." />
    <node id="1. The passengers are traveling in a long, bare train car with cracked windows and no amenities such as porters, pillows, or provisions for beds. This suggests that the journey is going to be uncomfortable and tiring for them.&#10;&#10;2. The diverse group of people includes farmers, workmen, traveling salesmen, and families. They all seem tired, parched, and cramped, waiting for their destination. Their appearances and behaviors reveal different social classes, personality traits, and levels of consideration towards others.&#10;&#10;3. Some passengers are messy and inconsiderate, such as the soiled man and woman who eat sandwiches and throw the crusts on the floor, or the large Norwegian who takes off his shoes and props his feet on the seat in front of him. These actions might cause discomfort to other passengers and reflect their lack of thoughtfulness.&#10;&#10;4. On the other hand, some passengers are more cautious and sentimental about their belongings. An example is the old woman who anxiously checks her bag multiple times, which contains personal treasures and memories. This behavior suggests that she values her possessions and the memories associated with them.&#10;&#10;5. The narrative also features an elderly mother who opens a suitcase containing personal items such as blouses, slippers, patent medicine, a tin cup, and a paper-covered book about dreams. She feeds her baby a graham cracker, but most of the crumbs fall on the seat, and she tries to clean them up unsuccessfully. This behavior demonstrates her love and care for her child as well as her consideration towards other passengers in attempting to clean up the mess.&#10;&#10;6. The protagonist, Carol, notices the other passengers and makes assumptions about them based on their appearances and behaviors. She wonders if the towns they pass through were built haphazardly or if it required genius to create such unattractive settlements. This shows that she is an observant individual who evaluates her surroundings and the people in them, making assumptions about them accordingly." />

The oldest boy takes a mouth-organ out of his&#10;coat pocket, wipes the tobacco crumbs off, and plays &quot;Marching through&#10;Georgia&quot; till every head in the car begins to ache.&#10;&#10;The news-butcher comes through selling chocolate bars and lemon drops.&#10;A girl-child ceaselessly trots down to the water-cooler and back to her&#10;seat. The stiff paper envelope which she uses for cup drips in the aisle&#10;as she goes, and on each trip she stumbles over the feet of a carpenter,&#10;who grunts, &quot;Ouch!

    <node id="1. Unattractive and unplanned buildings: The residences in Gopher Prairie are described as unappealing and haphazardly constructed, with no regard for aesthetics or design. This lack of planning creates a chaotic appearance that contributes to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about the town.&#10;2. Limited size and isolation: The town is small, surrounded by open prairie on all sides, making it feel even more insignificant and isolated. This vastness and emptiness make Carol feel overwhelmed and trapped, as she realizes that Gopher Prairie will be her new home.&#10;3. Absence of parks and green spaces: While the town does have some trees and lawns, there is no central park or significant green space to provide visual relief or a sense of community. The lack of such areas further contributes to Carol's impression that Gopher Prairie is unplanned and inhospitable.&#10;4. Comparison with Schoenstrom: When Carol sees an even smaller, less remarkable town like Schoenstrom, she asks Kennicott if it is one of the &quot;not-so-bad&quot; towns he had mentioned earlier. This comparison highlights her disappointment with Gopher Prairie and reinforces her desire for a more appealing living environment.&#10;5. Seasonal changes: Although there is an attempt to maintain the beauty of the leaves on the trees, it does not hold Carol's attention. She recognizes that the maples are orange and the oaks have a solid raspberry tint, but these colors fail to impress her or make up for the town's overall shortcomings.&#10;&#10;In summary, the residences and surroundings in Gopher Prairie leave much to be desired, as they appear unattractive, unplanned, and isolated from their prairie surroundings. These factors, combined with a lack of green spaces and the overwhelming vastness of the landscape, contribute to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about her new home." />

The broad,&#10;straight, unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie&#10;on every side. She realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land.&#10;The skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away, at the north&#10;end of Main Street, was like the ribs of a dead cow. She thought of the&#10;coming of the Northern winter, when the unprotected houses would crouch&#10;together in terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste. They&#10;were so small and weak, the little brown houses. They were shelters for&#10;sparrows, not homes for warm laughing people.&#10;&#10;She told herself that down the street the leaves were a splendor. The&#10;maples were orange; the oaks a solid tint of raspberry. And the lawns&#10;had been nursed with love. But the thought would not hold. At best the&#10;trees resembled a thinned woodlot.

At Sam Clark's party, topics include Raymie Wutherspoon's shoes, Champ Perry's rheumatism, Guy Pollock's grippe, Jim Howland's fence painting, and Percy Bresnahan's connection to the town. Carol Kennicott attempts to enliven the gathering by being more outgoing and sharing personal details about herself and her interests, but she eventually tires of maintaining this facade and steps back to find that meaningful dialogue is indeed absent in Gopher Prairie. The suggested 'stunts' are an attempt to provide some entertainment in the otherwise dull conversation." />
    <node id="Upon meeting Carol, the Dawsons and other community members are shy and polite. They engage in small talk, asking her if she likes Gopher Prairie and making general statements about the town. However, it seems that they struggle to find common ground or initiate meaningful conversation with her.&#10;&#10;As for Mr. Mott, he is more proactive in making Carol feel welcome. As the superintendent of schools, he focuses on his professional connection with her and greets her warmly, highlighting his role as a mandarin figure in Gopher Prairie's educational system. While the other townspeople seem to struggle with initiating conversation, Mr. Mott takes charge and helps create a sense of belonging for Carol." />

His wife had bleached cheeks, bleached hair,&#10;bleached voice, and a bleached manner. She wore her expensive green&#10;frock, with its passementeried bosom, bead tassels, and gaps between the&#10;buttons down the back, as though she had bought it second-hand and was&#10;afraid of meeting the former owner. They were shy. It was &quot;Professor&quot;&#10;George Edwin Mott, superintendent of schools, a Chinese mandarin turned&#10;brown, who held Carol's hand and made her welcome.&#10;&#10;When the Dawsons and Mr. Mott had stated that they were &quot;pleased to meet&#10;her,&quot; there seemed to be nothing else to say, but the conversation went&#10;on automatically.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you like Gopher Prairie?&quot; whimpered Mrs. Dawson.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I'm sure I'm going to be ever so happy" />
    <node id="The woman, Carol, feels both invisible and conspicuous upon seeing Gopher Prairie for the first time. She is unimpressed by the town's lack of planning and aesthetics, which contrasts with her initial expectations. Buildings in Gopher Prairie are described as unattractive and randomly placed, lacking any cohesive architectural style.&#10;&#10;Carol's disappointment stems from her realization that the town is not as promising as she had hoped. This reaction solidifies her disenchantment with married life, making her question her relationship with Kennicott and feel uncertain about their future together in this small town. The people of Gopher Prairie initially struggle to connect with Carol, but Mr. Mott takes the lead in welcoming her by focusing on their professional connection.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's reaction to seeing Gopher Prairie is underwhelming and disappointing, contrasting sharply with her initial expectations. This revelation further exacerbates her disillusionment with married life, making her question the wisdom of her decision to move to this small town with Kennicott. Despite the townspeople's initial struggles to connect with Carol, Mr. Mott steps up and helps create a sense of belonging for her by focusing on their professional relationship." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the individuals mentioned, particularly Mr. Elder, Dave Dyer, and Dr. Kennicott, have a negative view of certain labor-related concepts such as profit-sharing, welfare work, insurance, and old-age pension. They believe that these ideas enfeeble a worker's independence and waste honest profit. They see them as unnecessary complications and &quot;poppycock&quot; introduced by half-baked thinkers, college professors, and suffragettes. They prefer to handle labor disputes directly, man to man, and are opposed to outside interference in their businesses, such as that from union leaders who they view as rich grafters exploiting ignorant workers.&#10;&#10;They value freedom and constitutional rights, and believe that if a worker doesn't like their shop, he can leave, and vice versa. They also have a negative view of college professors and other individuals trying to tell businessmen how to run their businesses. They believe it is an attack on the integrity of American industry and that these individuals are socialists in disguise. They are opposed to this interference and consider it their duty as producers to resist such attacks.&#10;&#10;In summary, they are against labor welfare practices and outside interference in their businesses. They believe in dealing with labor disputes directly and man to man, and value freedom and constitutional rights." />

Sam can show&#10;speed to any of these Marmons from Minneapolis!&quot;&#10;&#10;Only when she was in the motor car did she distinguish the three people&#10;who were to accompany them. The owner, now at the wheel, was the essence&#10;of decent self-satisfaction; a baldish, largish, level-eyed man, rugged&#10;of neck but sleek and round of face--face like the back of a spoon bowl.&#10;He was chuckling at her, &quot;Have you got us all straight yet?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Course she has! Trust Carrie to get things straight and get 'em darn&#10;quick! I bet she could tell you every date in history!&quot; boasted her&#10;husband.&#10;&#10;But the man looked at her reassuringly and with a certainty that he&#10;was a person whom she could trust she confessed, &quot;As a matter of fact I&#10;haven't got anybody straight.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Course you haven't, child. Well, I'm Sam Clark," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Carol forms different first impressions of the Dawsons and Mr. Mott during her arrival in Gopher Prairie. The Dawsons are described as shy and hesitant, wearing unpressed clothes with bleached cheeks, hair, voice, and manner. Mrs. Dawson appears anxious, while Mr. Dawson is a milky-faced man who owns Northern cut-over land and lends money on mortgages. Overall, the Dawsons come across as cautious and perhaps conservative in their appearance and demeanor.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Mr. Mott, the superintendent of schools, stands out as a more welcoming figure. He is described as a &quot;Chinese mandarin turned brown,&quot; which could imply an air of authority or sophistication. Mr. Mott takes charge in introducing himself and making Carol feel welcome by focusing on their professional connection. The Dawsons, in contrast, struggle to initiate conversation with her despite their politeness.&#10;&#10;In terms of initial conversation, the Dawsons ask general questions about Gopher Prairie and engage in small talk, while Mr. Mott discusses educational matters and shares his experiences with prominent figures from the town. The difference in conversation topics reflects the varying levels of connection each individual has with Carol, as well as their unique personalities and interests." />
    <node id="1. The person in the narrative, Carol, feels a sense of fear and unease as she realizes that Gopher Prairie is the next town on their journey, making her feel trapped and terrified at the thought of living there. She also begins to question her relationship with Kennicott and wonders how they could have ever shared adventures or excitement together.&#10;2. Carol finds the town of Gopher Prairie unattractive and unplanned, with no consideration for aesthetics in its buildings. The sights and sounds she notices, such as a lumber-wagon, a Ford, and a Greek candy-store, contribute to her overall impression of the town as small and dull.&#10;3. Carol feels both invisible and conspicuous in the small town. She is unimpressed by its lack of planning and aesthetics, and begins to question her relationship with Kennicott. The sight of the even smaller town of Schoenstrom further solidifies her disappointment.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the person in the narrative, Carol, has a negative impression of the small town of Gopher Prairie. She finds it unattractive and is unimpressed by its lack of planning and aesthetics. She also feels both invisible and conspicuous in the town, and begins to question her relationship with Kennicott.

A Ford, in reverse, sounded as though it&#10;were shaking to pieces, then recovered and rattled away.

She finds herself unable to believe that she has slept in his arms and wonders how they could have ever shared any adventures or excitement together.&#10;2. Carol's thoughts on Kennicott are mixed. On the one hand, she recognizes his good qualities and acknowledges that he is dependable and kind. However, she also sees him as heavy-necked, heavy-speeched, and several years older than her. Moreover, she feels that they have little in common and that there is no magic or excitement between them anymore. She begins to question the wisdom of her decision to marry him and move to Gopher Prairie, feeling increasingly uncertain about her future in this small town.">

They see them as unnecessary complications and &quot;poppycock&quot; introduced by half-baked thinkers, college professors, and suffragettes. They prefer to handle labor disputes directly, man to man, and are opposed to outside interference in their businesses, such as that from union leaders who they view as rich grafters exploiting ignorant workers.

Carol is a self-conscious and insecure person who tries to overcompensate by putting on a bold and outgoing persona, particularly during social gatherings. This can be seen in her attempts to be the &quot;Clever Little Bride&quot; of Doc Kennicott, where she makes exaggerated statements and shares personal details about herself to entertain the crowd.&#10;2. She is also a bit of an outsider who feels disconnected from the people around her. This is evident in her inability to distinguish the eyes of the other party-goers and seeing them as a &quot;blurry theater-audience.&quot;&#10;3. Despite her insecurities, Carol values her relationship with Doc Kennicott and appreciates his love and support. She expresses relief and happiness in being cherished by him despite how she felt about her own performance during the event.&#10;4. Carol has a desire for excitement and adventure, as evidenced by her descriptions of their Colorado trip where she leaped from peak to peak and encouraged her husband to go swimming in icy waters. This contrasts with the mundane and unremarkable nature of Gopher Prairie, further fueling her feelings of self-consciousness and unease.&#10;5. She has a sense of humor and is not afraid to make fun of herself or poke gentle fun at her husband's expense. This can be seen in her playful banter with Mrs. Dawson about locking up Doc Kennicott for being a flirt.&#10;&#10;Regarding the comedic interaction between Carol and Mr. Dawson, during Sam Clark's party, Carol intentionally misinterprets Mr. Dawson's firm handshake as flirtatious behavior. She exaggerates this innocent gesture and teases him by saying he is a &quot;heart-breaker&quot; in front of the other party guests. This lighthearted moment leads to Mr. Dawson being called a &quot;heart-breaker&quot; for the first time, much to everyone's amusement.">

The atmosphere at a social gathering in Gopher Prairie is characterized by a lack of intellectual conversation, as people tend to focus on discussing personalities and mundane matters. At Sam Clark's party, topics include Raymie Wutherspoon's shoes, Champ Perry's rheumatism, Guy Pollock's grippe, Jim Howland's fence painting, and Percy Bresnahan's connection to the town. Carol Kennicott attempts to enliven the gathering by being more outgoing and sharing personal details about herself and her interests, but she eventually tires of maintaining this facade and steps back to find that meaningful dialogue is indeed absent in Gopher Prairie. The suggested 'stunts' are an attempt to provide some entertainment in the otherwise dull conversation.">

The only habitable structures to be seen are the florid red-brick Catholic church and rectory at the end of Main Street.&#10;&#10;In summary, the atmosphere in Schoenstrom is one of a small and rural town with a run-down business center, unremarkable saloons, and shops that offer limited selections. The residents are described as being indifferent to outsiders, but observant of their surroundings. The clothing store window display is lackluster, with suits that look worn even when new and floral pique collars that show mauve.">

The buildings are described as ill-assorted and temporary-looking, similar to a mining-camp street in the motion-pictures.&#10;&#10;The saloons in Schoenstrom are described as having a stale beer smell and thick voices bellowing pidgin German or trolling out dirty songs. The atmosphere is described as vice gone feeble and unenterprising, with farmwives waiting for their husbands to become drunk.&#10;&#10;The shops on Main Street include a tobacco shop called &quot;The Smoke House,&quot; filled with young men shaking dice for cigarettes and racks of magazines, and pictures of coy fat prostitutes in striped bathing-suits. A clothing store has a display of &quot;ox-blood-shade Oxfords with bull-dog toes&quot; and suits that look worn and glossless while they are still new. The Bon Ton Store is the largest shop in town, with a first-story front of clear glass and one window of excellent clothes for men interspersed with collars of floral pique which showed mauve.&#10;&#10;The residents of Schoenstrom are described as being indifferent to Carol's presence, and they are more observant than she gives them credit for.

The residents are described as being indifferent to outsiders, but observant of their surroundings. The clothing store window display is lackluster, with suits that look worn even when new and floral pique collars that show mauve.">

Unattractive and unplanned buildings: The residences in Gopher Prairie are described as unappealing and haphazardly constructed, with no regard for aesthetics or design. This lack of planning creates a chaotic appearance that contributes to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about the town.&#10;2. Limited size and isolation: The town is small, surrounded by open prairie on all sides, making it feel even more insignificant and isolated. This vastness and emptiness make Carol feel overwhelmed and trapped, as she realizes that Gopher Prairie will be her new home.&#10;3. Absence of parks and green spaces: While the town does have some trees and lawns, there is no central park or significant green space to provide visual relief or a sense of community. The lack of such areas further contributes to Carol's impression that Gopher Prairie is unplanned and inhospitable.&#10;4. Comparison with Schoenstrom: When Carol sees an even smaller, less remarkable town like Schoenstrom, she asks Kennicott if it is one of the &quot;not-so-bad&quot; towns he had mentioned earlier. This comparison highlights her disappointment with Gopher Prairie and reinforces her desire for a more appealing living environment.&#10;5. Seasonal changes: Although there is an attempt to maintain the beauty of the leaves on the trees, it does not hold Carol's attention. She recognizes that the maples are orange and the oaks have a solid raspberry tint, but these colors fail to impress her or make up for the town's overall shortcomings.&#10;&#10;In summary, the residences and surroundings in Gopher Prairie leave much to be desired, as they appear unattractive, unplanned, and isolated from their prairie surroundings. These factors, combined with a lack of green spaces and the overwhelming vastness of the landscape, contribute to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about her new home.">

    <edge source="The narrative describes a train traveling through Minnesota, carrying a diverse group of passengers. The setting is hot and dusty, and the train itself is not luxurious, with no porters, pillows, or provisions for beds. The passengers come from different backgrounds, including farmers, workmen, and traveling salesmen. They all seem tired, parched, and cramped, waiting for their destination.&#10;&#10;A woman feeds her baby a graham cracker, but most of the crumbs fall on the seat, and she tries to clean them up unsuccessfully. A soiled man and woman eat sandwiches and throw the crusts on the floor. A large Norwegian takes off his shoes and props his feet on the seat in front of him.

    <edge source="1. Carol is a self-conscious and insecure person who tries to overcompensate by putting on a bold and outgoing persona, particularly during social gatherings. This can be seen in her attempts to be the &quot;Clever Little Bride&quot; of Doc Kennicott, where she makes exaggerated statements and shares personal details about herself to entertain the crowd.&#10;2. She is also a bit of an outsider who feels disconnected from the people around her. This is evident in her inability to distinguish the eyes of the other party-goers and seeing them as a &quot;blurry theater-audience.&quot;&#10;3. Despite her insecurities, Carol values her relationship with Doc Kennicott and appreciates his love and support. She expresses relief and happiness in being cherished by him despite how she felt about her own performance during the event.&#10;4. Carol has a desire for excitement and adventure, as evidenced by her descriptions of their Colorado trip where she leaped from peak to peak and encouraged her husband to go swimming in icy waters. This contrasts with the mundane and unremarkable nature of Gopher Prairie, further fueling her feelings of self-consciousness and unease.&#10;5. She has a sense of humor and is not afraid to make fun of herself or poke gentle fun at her husband's expense. This can be seen in her playful banter with Mrs. Dawson about locking up Doc Kennicott for being a flirt.&#10;&#10;Regarding the comedic interaction between Carol and Mr. Dawson, during Sam Clark's party, Carol intentionally misinterprets Mr. Dawson's firm handshake as flirtatious behavior. She exaggerates this innocent gesture and teases him by saying he is a &quot;heart-breaker&quot; in front of the other party guests. This lighthearted moment leads to Mr. Dawson being called a &quot;heart-breaker&quot; for the first time, much to everyone's amusement." target=" tell him I said so--don't you ever go to him for anything&#10;more serious than a pendectomy of the left ear or a strabismus of the&#10;cardiograph.&quot;&#10;&#10;No one save Kennicott knew exactly what this meant, but they laughed,&#10;and Sam Clark's party assumed a glittering lemon-yellow color of brocade&#10;panels and champagne and tulle and crystal chandeliers and sporting&#10;duchesses. Carol saw that George Edwin Mott and the blanched Mr. and&#10;Mrs. Dawson were not yet hypnotized. They looked as though they wondered&#10;whether they ought to look as though they disapproved. She concentrated&#10;on them:&#10;&#10;&quot;But I know whom I wouldn't have dared to go to Colorado with! Mr.&#10;Dawson there! I'm sure he's a regular heart-breaker. When we were&#10;introduced he held my hand and squeezed it frightfully.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Haw! Haw! Haw!&quot; The entire company applauded. Mr. Dawson was beatified.&#10;He had been called many things--loan-shark, skinflint, tightwad,&#10;pussyfoot--but he had never before been called a flirt.&#10;">

Limited size and isolation: The town is small, surrounded by open prairie on all sides, making it feel even more insignificant and isolated.

The lack of such areas further contributes to Carol's impression that Gopher Prairie is unplanned and inhospitable.&#10;4. Comparison with Schoenstrom: When Carol sees an even smaller, less remarkable town like Schoenstrom, she asks Kennicott if it is one of the &quot;not-so-bad&quot; towns he had mentioned earlier. This comparison highlights her disappointment with Gopher Prairie and reinforces her desire for a more appealing living environment.&#10;5. Seasonal changes: Although there is an attempt to maintain the beauty of the leaves on the trees, it does not hold Carol's attention. She recognizes that the maples are orange and the oaks have a solid raspberry tint, but these colors fail to impress her or make up for the town's overall shortcomings.&#10;&#10;In summary, the residences and surroundings in Gopher Prairie leave much to be desired, as they appear unattractive, unplanned, and isolated from their prairie surroundings. These factors, combined with a lack of green spaces and the overwhelming vastness of the landscape, contribute to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about her new home.">

    <edge source="1. Unattractive and unplanned buildings: The residences in Gopher Prairie are described as unappealing and haphazardly constructed, with no regard for aesthetics or design. This lack of planning creates a chaotic appearance that contributes to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about the town.&#10;2. Limited size and isolation: The town is small, surrounded by open prairie on all sides, making it feel even more insignificant and isolated. This vastness and emptiness make Carol feel overwhelmed and trapped, as she realizes that Gopher Prairie will be her new home.&#10;3. Absence of parks and green spaces: While the town does have some trees and lawns, there is no central park or significant green space to provide visual relief or a sense of community. The lack of such areas further contributes to Carol's impression that Gopher Prairie is unplanned and inhospitable.&#10;4. Comparison with Schoenstrom: When Carol sees an even smaller, less remarkable town like Schoenstrom, she asks Kennicott if it is one of the &quot;not-so-bad&quot; towns he had mentioned earlier. This comparison highlights her disappointment with Gopher Prairie and reinforces her desire for a more appealing living environment.&#10;5. Seasonal changes: Although there is an attempt to maintain the beauty of the leaves on the trees, it does not hold Carol's attention. She recognizes that the maples are orange and the oaks have a solid raspberry tint, but these colors fail to impress her or make up for the town's overall shortcomings.&#10;&#10;In summary, the residences and surroundings in Gopher Prairie leave much to be desired, as they appear unattractive, unplanned, and isolated from their prairie surroundings. These factors, combined with a lack of green spaces and the overwhelming vastness of the landscape, contribute to Carol's feelings of disappointment and unease about her new home." target="&#10;residences, its muddy expanse from concrete walk to walk, its huddle&#10;of Fords and lumber-wagons, was too small to absorb her. The broad,&#10;straight, unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie&#10;on every side. She realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land.&#10;The skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away, at the north&#10;end of Main Street, was like the ribs of a dead cow. She thought of the&#10;coming of the Northern winter, when the unprotected houses would crouch&#10;together in terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste. They&#10;were so small and weak, the little brown houses. They were shelters for&#10;sparrows, not homes for warm laughing people.&#10;&#10;She told herself that down the street the leaves were a splendor. The&#10;maples were orange; the oaks a solid tint of raspberry. And the lawns&#10;had been nursed with love. But the thought would not hold. At best the&#10;trees resembled a thinned woodlot. There was no park to rest the eyes.&#10;And since not Gopher Prairie but Wakamin was the county-seat, there was&#10;">

The atmosphere at a social gathering in Gopher Prairie is characterized by a lack of intellectual conversation, as people tend to focus on discussing personalities and mundane matters. At Sam Clark's party, topics include Raymie Wutherspoon's shoes, Champ Perry's rheumatism, Guy Pollock's grippe, Jim Howland's fence painting, and Percy Bresnahan's connection to the town. Carol Kennicott attempts to enliven the gathering by being more outgoing and sharing personal details about herself and her interests, but she eventually tires of maintaining this facade and steps back to find that meaningful dialogue is indeed absent in Gopher Prairie. The suggested 'stunts' are an attempt to provide some entertainment in the otherwise dull conversation." target="The owner of the motor car is Sam Clark.

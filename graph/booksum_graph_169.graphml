    <node id="William Dobbin's infatuation with Amelia is so great that he has idealized her in his mind to an extreme degree. He has held onto a sentimental image of her for many years, even though it may not accurately represent the real Amelia. This idealized version of Amelia was likely formed from a simple print of a fashionable gown and a vague resemblance Dobbin perceived between the figure in the print and his beloved.&#10;&#10;Dobbin's love for Amelia has clouded his judgment, causing him to believe that she is more perfect and deserving than she may actually be. This misperception is evident when contrasting Dobbin's description of Amelia with the actual characteristics of her personality revealed in the narrative. She is portrayed as a self-centered individual who cares little for the feelings or well-being of others, including her own child. Despite this, Dobbin remains under the spell of his sentimental image of her and is deeply hurt by her lack of interest in him.&#10;&#10;The passage also indicates that Dobbin's friends and the public were not aware of his strong feelings for Amelia, suggesting he kept them private. He suffers emotionally as a result of this unrequited love, becoming disillusioned with life and even contemplating ending it due to the perceived futility of his struggle to win Amelia's affection. The contrast between Dobbin's idealized image of Amelia and her true self highlights the depth of his infatuation and its impact on his perception of reality." />
    <node id="--there was but this image that filled our honest&#10;Major's mind, by day and by night, and reigned over it always.  Very&#10;likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Major had formed of her:&#10;there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in&#10;England, and with which William had made away privately, pasting it&#10;into the lid of his desk, and fancying he saw some resemblance to Mrs.&#10;Osborne in the print, whereas I have seen it, and can vouch that it is&#10;but the picture of a high-waisted gown with an impossible doll's face&#10;simpering over it--and, perhaps, Mr. Dobbin's sentimental Amelia was no&#10;more like the real one than this absurd little print which he&#10;cherished.  But what man in love, of us, is better informed?--or is he&#10;much happier when he sees and owns his delusion? Dobbin was under this&#10;spell.  He did not bother his friends and the public much about his&#10;feelings, or indeed lose his natural rest or appetite on account of&#10;them.

And after the boisterous dulness of&#10;the mess-table, the quarrels and scandal of the ladies of the regiment!&#10;It was unbearable, shameful.  &quot;O Amelia, Amelia,&quot; he thought, &quot;you to&#10;whom I have been so faithful--you reproach me!  It is because you&#10;cannot feel for me that I drag on this wearisome life.  And you reward&#10;me after years of devotion by giving me your blessing upon my marriage,&#10;forsooth, with this flaunting Irish girl!&quot; Sick and sorry felt poor&#10;William; more than ever wretched and lonely.  He would like to have&#10;done with life and its vanity altogether--so bootless and&#10;unsatisfactory the struggle, so cheerless and dreary the prospect&#10;seemed to him.  He lay all that night sleepless, and yearning to go&#10;home.  Amelia's letter had fallen as a blank upon him.  No fidelity, no&#10;constant truth and passion, could move her into warmth.

His aunt had shown her&#10;inclination; perhaps his grandfather himself, they hinted, might be&#10;disposed to be reconciled to him.  Surely, Amelia could not refuse such&#10;advantageous chances for the boy.  Nor could she, but she acceded to&#10;their overtures with a very heavy and suspicious heart, was always&#10;uneasy during the child's absence from her, and welcomed him back as if&#10;he was rescued out of some danger.  He brought back money and toys, at&#10;which the widow looked with alarm and jealousy; she asked him always if&#10;he had seen any gentleman--&quot;Only old Sir William, who drove him about&#10;in the four-wheeled chaise, and Mr. Dobbin, who arrived on the&#10;beautiful bay horse in the afternoon--in the green coat and pink&#10;neck-cloth, with the gold-headed whip, who promised to show him the&#10;Tower of London and take him out with the Surrey hounds.&quot; At last, he&#10;said, &quot;There was an old gentleman, with thick eyebrows, and a broad" />

She had a great access of&#10;sensibility too that day, when obliged to go and countermand the&#10;clothes, the darling clothes on which she had set her heart for&#10;Christmas Day, and the cut and fashion of which she had arranged in&#10;many conversations with a small milliner, her friend.&#10;&#10;Hardest of all, she had to break the matter to Georgy, who made a loud&#10;outcry.  Everybody had new clothes at Christmas.  The others would&#10;laugh at him.  He would have new clothes.  She had promised them to&#10;him.  The poor widow had only kisses to give him.  She darned the old&#10;suit in tears.  She cast about among her little ornaments to see if she&#10;could sell anything to procure the desired novelties.

The&#10;remaining three sides are composed of mansions that have passed away&#10;into dowagerism--tall, dark houses, with window-frames of stone, or&#10;picked out of a lighter red.

It was only&#10;her delight at going to Gaunt House and facing the ladies there, she&#10;said, which amused her so.  But the truth was that she was occupied&#10;with a great number of other thoughts.  Should she pay off old Briggs&#10;and give her her conge? Should she astonish Raggles by settling his&#10;account? She turned over all these thoughts on her pillow, and on the&#10;next day, when Rawdon went out to pay his morning visit to the Club,&#10;Mrs. Crawley (in a modest dress with a veil on) whipped off in a&#10;hackney-coach to the City:  and being landed at Messrs.

He knew very well&#10;that he was the proprietor or appropriator of the money, which,&#10;according to all proper calculation, ought to have fallen to his&#10;younger brother, and he had, we may be sure, some secret pangs of&#10;remorse within him, which warned him that he ought to perform some act&#10;of justice, or, let us say, compensation, towards these disappointed&#10;relations.

And they told her how much the Hall was&#10;changed for the better, and how old Lady Southdown was gone, and how&#10;Pitt was taking his station in the county, as became a Crawley in fact.&#10;Then the great dinner-bell having rung, the family assembled at dinner,&#10;at which meal Rawdon Junior was placed by his aunt, the good-natured&#10;lady of the house, Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his&#10;sister-in-law at his own right hand.&#10;&#10;Little Rawdon exhibited a fine appetite" />

He&#10;was allowed to go to the club more; to dine abroad with bachelor&#10;friends; to come and go when he liked, without any questions being&#10;asked.  And he and Rawdon the younger many a time would walk to Gaunt&#10;Street and sit with the lady and the children there while Sir Pitt was&#10;closeted with Rebecca, on his way to the House, or on  his return from&#10;it.&#10;&#10;The ex-Colonel would sit for hours in his brother's house very silent,&#10;and thinking and doing as little as possible.

She was acknowledged by the&#10;head of the family.  If Pitt would not give her anything, he would get&#10;something for her some day.  If she got no money from her&#10;brother-in-law, she got what was as good as money--credit.

The fact is, when she was putting Sir Pitt's&#10;house in order, Mrs. Rawdon had found the lace and the brocade in old&#10;wardrobes, the property of the former ladies of the house, and had&#10;quietly carried the goods home, and had suited them to her own little&#10;person.

This formed part of Rebecca's larger plan to secure a position for herself within the influential Crawley family.&#10;&#10;After their meeting, Rawdon, Rebecca's husband, feels increasingly isolated in the household. He is allowed more freedom and spends time with his brother Pitt Crawley on his way to or from Parliament at Gaunt House, where Rebecca often stays with Sir Pitt.&#10;&#10;During one of her visits to Gaunt House, Rebecca surreptitiously visits Messrs. Jones and Robinson's bank in the City of London to present a document, likely involving financial transactions. The nature of these transactions is not specified but may be related to settling debts or assisting those in need, as suggested by her earlier thoughts about paying off her former governess, Mrs. Briggs, and helping Raggles.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Rawdon is disappointed after the Baronet's visit because he was unable to secure any financial assistance for Raggles from him. Rawdon believes that providing some money to Raggles would be the right thing to do, as keeping the old man without access to his own funds does not seem fair or just.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca and Rawdon Sharp did not make any specific arrangements with their wealthy acquaintance, the Baronet, during their meeting in his coach.

They were separated from that&#10;day of the boxes on the ear.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne also heartily disliked the boy.  When they met by&#10;mischance, he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child, or glared at&#10;him with savage-looking eyes.

These descriptions suggest that Lord George Gaunt might have experienced some mental health challenges, making it unlikely for him to have effectively served in any official capacity abroad during this time.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the text implies that Lord George Gaunt probably did not physically go to Brazil and may have been dealing with mental health problems while in London, as evidenced by his strange behavior and the need for supervision or institutionalization." />

Despite his past wealth and status, Sedley now treats everyone with respect, including his social inferiors. He is grateful for the assistance he receives from others, such as when Clapp's former employer offers him employment. Sedley also reminisces about the past, recalling the grandeur of his previous life with nostalgia. Furthermore, he maintains his sense of honor and loyalty, refusing to let anyone speak ill of his friends. Overall, Sedley has become a more humble and grateful person due to his misfortunes." />

    <node id="The bitterness and indignation expressed by Lady Crackenbury and Mrs. Bute Crawley are due to the perception that this unnamed woman has acquired superb diamonds and a court presentation, which they deem as inappropriate rewards for someone with her background.

The fact that this woman has hired diamonds for the occasion further fuels their indignation, as they see it as a form of deceit intended to exaggerate her social importance. &#10;&#10;In summary, Lady Crackenbury and Mrs. Bute Crawley's bitterness is rooted in their belief that the unnamed woman has obtained honors which they feel should be reserved for those of higher social standing, as well as their perception that she has used deceit to enhance her social prestige." />

We may suppose, too, that Rebecca, on&#10;paying a second visit to Queen's Crawley, did not feel particularly&#10;grieved at the absence of the lady of the medicine chest; though she&#10;wrote a Christmas letter to her Ladyship, in which she respectfully&#10;recalled herself to Lady Southdown's recollection, spoke with gratitude&#10;of the delight which her Ladyship's conversation had given her on the&#10;former visit, dilated on the kindness with which her Ladyship had&#10;treated her in sickness, and declared that everything at Queen's&#10;Crawley reminded her of her absent friend.&#10;&#10;A great part of the altered demeanour and popularity of Sir Pitt&#10;Crawley might have been traced to the counsels of that astute little&#10;lady of Curzon Street.  &quot;You remain a Baronet--you consent to be a mere&#10;country gentleman,&quot; she said to him, while he had been her guest in&#10;London. &quot;No, Sir Pitt Crawley, I know you better.

She worked hard to &quot;get up the genteel&quot; with great assiduity, success, and adopting a grand and imposing demeanor (even going so far as to model her behavior after an empress). She was particularly concerned about appearances, as seen when she hid their financial troubles from others and even rented a carriage to maintain the illusion of wealth.&#10;&#10;Becky also manipulated and used people for her own benefit, such as when she borrowed money from Miss Briggs and kept it a secret from everyone else. She looked down on those who did not share her ambition, like Lady Jane, whom she mocked for her simple pleasures and fairy-like demeanor.

We have said, there were times when she believed herself&#10;to be a fine lady and forgot that there was no money in the chest at&#10;home--duns round the gate, tradesmen to coax and wheedle--no ground to&#10;walk upon, in a word.  And as she went to Court in the carriage, the&#10;family carriage, she adopted a demeanour so grand, self-satisfied,&#10;deliberate, and imposing that it made even Lady Jane laugh.  She walked&#10;into the royal apartments with a toss of the head which would have&#10;befitted an empress" />

And Becky,&#10;reflecting on the largeness of his means, mentioned not only the sum&#10;which she had borrowed from Miss Briggs, but one of nearly double the&#10;amount.&#10;&#10;This caused the Lord Steyne to break out in another brief and energetic&#10;expression of anger, at which Rebecca held down her head the more and&#10;cried bitterly.  &quot;I could not help it.

He is treated with kindness and attention, which he may not receive at home. Furthermore, he has the opportunity to learn about the world outside his home, as Sir Pitt explains who lives in the great white houses and parks they pass by during their journey.

The contents of the note are not specified, but based on the context, it may have been related to her financial arrangements or dealings with the bank.&#10;     It is also worth noting that after receiving the card of invitation from Lord and Lady Steyne to a dinner at Gaunt House next Friday, Becky visited Messrs. Jones and Robinson's bank in the City to present a document and receive some funds.

Mrs. Rawdon's dress was pronounced to be charmante on the&#10;eventful day of her presentation. Even good little Lady Jane was forced&#10;to acknowledge this effect, as she looked at her kinswoman, and owned&#10;sorrowfully to herself that she was quite inferior in taste to Mrs.&#10;Becky.&#10;&#10;She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Rawdon had&#10;bestowed upon that garment.  Rebecca had as good taste as any milliner&#10;in Europe, and such a clever way of doing things as Lady Jane little&#10;understood. The latter quickly spied out the magnificence of the&#10;brocade of Becky's train, and the splendour of the lace on her dress.&#10;&#10;The brocade was an old remnant, Becky said; and as for the lace, it was&#10;a great bargain.

Lady Steyne's carriage&#10;drove up to Mr. Rawdon Crawley's door, and the footman, instead of&#10;driving down the front of the house, as by his tremendous knocking he&#10;appeared to be inclined to do, relented and only delivered in a couple&#10;of cards, on which were engraven the names of the Marchioness of Steyne&#10;and the Countess of Gaunt.  If these bits of pasteboard had been&#10;beautiful pictures, or had had a hundred yards of Malines lace rolled&#10;round them, worth twice the number of guineas, Becky could not have&#10;regarded them with more pleasure.

    <node id="Lady Mary Caerlyon, also known as the Marchioness of Steyne, married Lord Gaunt for several reasons. Firstly, she was brought up in a Parisian convent and was married off to Lord Gaunt after meeting him at one of Philip of Orleans's banquets, where her brother lost vast sums of money to him. Secondly, the Count de la Marche, a favorite of the Queen, also had pretensions towards Lady Mary, which likely prompted the Earl of Gaunt to marry her quickly in order to secure her hand and prevent the Count from marrying her. The narrator implies that the famous duel between the Earl of Gaunt and the Count de la Marche was attributed to the latter's pretensions towards Lady Mary. After their marriage, Lady Mary became a favorite of the Queen and figures prominently in the Court of the Prince of Wales. However, she was eventually scared by the wild pleasures and gaieties of society and retreated into a life of devout seclusion." />

The document Rebecca surreptitiously visits Messrs. Jones and Robinson's bank to present may hint at the potential for a better future for the boy through her actions. While the nature of these transactions is not explicitly stated, it could be related to settling debts or assisting those in need, possibly including her father and the boy. By taking action to improve their financial situation, Rebecca might be working towards restoring her father's competency and the boy's prospects, demonstrating a sense of responsibility and care for her family." />

His lordship carried off the&#10;sketch, delighted with the accuracy of the resemblance.  He had done&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley the honour to meet him at Mrs. Becky's house and had&#10;been most gracious to the new Baronet and member.  Pitt was struck too&#10;by the deference with which the great Peer treated his sister-in-law,&#10;by her ease and sprightliness in the conversation, and by the delight&#10;with which the other men of the party listened to her talk.

The feasts there were of the grandest in London, but&#10;there was not overmuch content therewith, except among the guests who&#10;sat at my lord's table.

    <node id="Rebecca Sharp (Mrs. Crawley) observed that Sir Pitt Crawley, despite being a Baronet and having the opportunity to remain in London as a social figure, chose to be a mere country gentleman. She made this conclusion based on her understanding of his talents and potential, which she believed were not being fully utilized or acknowledged in society. Rebecca recognized that Sir Pitt had the capability to excel beyond his current status, and her counsel likely played a significant role in influencing his decision to focus on his responsibilities as a country gentleman. This observation suggests that Rebecca is perceptive about people's abilities and motivations, which she uses to her advantage in securing a position for herself within the influential Crawley family. The narrator also mentions that &quot;a great part of the altered demeanour and popularity of Sir Pitt Crawley might have been traced to the counsels of that astute little lady of Curzon Street,&quot; further emphasizing Rebecca's impact on his decisions and reputation." />

Mrs. Bullock's concerns about her children's future, financial security, and social standing demonstrate her awareness of this potential fate.

Regarding the significant changes made by Sir Pitt to his property, the text highlights several improvements:&#10;   - The house had been much improved since Sir Pitt's brief reign and was praised by Rebecca Sharp for its perfection, charm, and delight.&#10;   - Long galleries, ancient state bedrooms, pictures, old China, and armor were present in the house, making it seem like a palace of enchantment to Rawdon.&#10;   - Sir Pitt had also focused on repairing fences and restoring dilapidated lodges on the Queen's Crawley estate, as well as rebuilding its injured popularity after his disreputable predecessor's tenure.&#10;   - Sir Pitt was elected for the borough soon after his father's demise, becoming a magistrate, a member of parliament, a county magnate and representative of an ancient family. He aimed to take a position in Hampshire and the Empire that he thought his prodigious talents deserved.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Glorvina, a young lady from County Cork in Ireland, has had a history of romantic exploits before setting her sights on Major Dobbin. She had a season in Dublin and likely spent time in other Irish cities like Cork, Killarney, and Mallow. During this time, she flirted with numerous eligible officers and bachelor squires. &#10;&#10;Glorvina had been engaged to be married half a dozen times in Ireland, which demonstrates her tendency to form serious attachments. Among her romantic endeavors, there is a mention of a clergyman at Bath who treated her poorly after she became involved with him. This event might have contributed to her wariness or shrewdness regarding romantic relationships.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Glorvina had once practiced music on Major Dobbin's piano because it was the most accessible instrument at their station.

And though she does not come of such&#10;good blood as the Malonys or Molloys, let me tell ye, she's of an&#10;ancient family that any nobleman might be proud to marry into.&quot;&#10;&#10;But before she had come to such a resolution and determined to&#10;subjugate Major Dobbin by her endearments, it must be owned that&#10;Glorvina had practised them a good deal elsewhere.  She had had a&#10;season in Dublin, and who knows how many in Cork, Killarney, and&#10;Mallow? She had flirted with all the marriageable officers whom the&#10;depots of her country afforded, and all the bachelor squires who seemed&#10;eligible.

Dobbin might want to check on their well-being or offer some assistance since they are going through financial difficulties. Another possible reason for his leave is his longstanding feelings for Amelia Osborne, which have been reignited after reading about her in his sister's letter.">

He is allowed more freedom and spends time with his brother Pitt Crawley on his way to or from Parliament at Gaunt House, where Rebecca often stays with Sir Pitt.&#10;&#10;During one of her visits to Gaunt House, Rebecca surreptitiously visits Messrs. Jones and Robinson's bank in the City of London to present a document, likely involving financial transactions. The nature of these transactions is not specified but may be related to settling debts or assisting those in need, as suggested by her earlier thoughts about paying off her former governess, Mrs. Briggs, and helping Raggles.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Rawdon is disappointed after the Baronet's visit because he was unable to secure any financial assistance for Raggles from him. Rawdon believes that providing some money to Raggles would be the right thing to do, as keeping the old man without access to his own funds does not seem fair or just.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca and Rawdon Sharp did not make any specific arrangements with their wealthy acquaintance, the Baronet, during their meeting in his coach. Rebecca's disappointment stems from not being able to help Raggles financially, while Rawdon is upset that he could not secure any money for Raggles from the Baronet.">

The description of him being &quot;accredited to a keeper, who has invested him with the order of the Strait-Waistcoat&quot; in Rio de Janeiro implies that he may have been institutionalized or placed under heavy supervision due to mental health issues.&#10;&#10;The narrative also reveals that Lord George Gaunt's mother visited him twice or thrice a week, finding him in various states: sometimes laughing (which was deemed more pitiful than hearing him cry), sometimes engaging with children's toys or nursing dolls, and occasionally showing awareness of his heir's bonds. These descriptions suggest that Lord George Gaunt might have experienced some mental health challenges, making it unlikely for him to have effectively served in any official capacity abroad during this time.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the text implies that Lord George Gaunt probably did not physically go to Brazil and may have been dealing with mental health problems while in London, as evidenced by his strange behavior and the need for supervision or institutionalization.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative provided, the significant change in Sedley's behavior and attitude, as observed by his ex-clerk Clapp, is that he has become more humble and appreciative. Despite his past wealth and status, Sedley now treats everyone with respect, including his social inferiors. He is grateful for the assistance he receives from others, such as when Clapp's former employer offers him employment. Sedley also reminisces about the past, recalling the grandeur of his previous life with nostalgia. Furthermore, he maintains his sense of honor and loyalty, refusing to let anyone speak ill of his friends.

Rebecca's personal realization that led her to sink into despair is that her selfishness has resulted in the sacrifice of the boy's opportunities for wealth, status, education, and his father's position. She sees that if she had not pursued her relationship with Mr. Crawley, her father would have been restored to competency and the boy raised to fortune.&#10;2. The document Rebecca surreptitiously visits Messrs. Jones and Robinson's bank to present may hint at the potential for a better future for the boy through her actions. While the nature of these transactions is not explicitly stated, it could be related to settling debts or assisting those in need, possibly including her father and the boy. By taking action to improve their financial situation, Rebecca might be working towards restoring her father's competency and the boy's prospects, demonstrating a sense of responsibility and care for her family.">

Regarding the significant changes made by Sir Pitt to his property, the text highlights several improvements:&#10;   - The house had been much improved since Sir Pitt's brief reign and was praised by Rebecca Sharp for its perfection, charm, and delight.&#10;   - Long galleries, ancient state bedrooms, pictures, old China, and armor were present in the house, making it seem like a palace of enchantment to Rawdon.&#10;   - Sir Pitt had also focused on repairing fences and restoring dilapidated lodges on the Queen's Crawley estate, as well as rebuilding its injured popularity after his disreputable predecessor's tenure.&#10;   - Sir Pitt was elected for the borough soon after his father's demise, becoming a magistrate, a member of parliament, a county magnate and representative of an ancient family.

And Pitt took care to tell Rawdon what a&#10;heavy outlay of money these improvements had occasioned, and that a man&#10;of landed and funded property was often very hard pressed for twenty&#10;pounds. &quot;There is that new lodge-gate,&quot; said Pitt, pointing to it&#10;humbly with the bamboo cane, &quot;I can no">

    <edge source="Based on the provided narrative, Glorvina, a young lady from County Cork in Ireland, has had a history of romantic exploits before setting her sights on Major Dobbin. She had a season in Dublin and likely spent time in other Irish cities like Cork, Killarney, and Mallow. During this time, she flirted with numerous eligible officers and bachelor squires. &#10;&#10;Glorvina had been engaged to be married half a dozen times in Ireland, which demonstrates her tendency to form serious attachments. Among her romantic endeavors, there is a mention of a clergyman at Bath who treated her poorly after she became involved with him. This event might have contributed to her wariness or shrewdness regarding romantic relationships.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Glorvina had once practiced music on Major Dobbin's piano because it was the most accessible instrument at their station. It is essential to note that these past experiences did not deter Glorvina from pursuing a relationship with Major Dobbin, whom she eventually married despite various obstacles and setbacks." target=" on&#10;so.--&quot;Look at Glorvina enter a room,&quot; Mrs. O'Dowd would say, &quot;and&#10;compare her with that poor Mrs. Osborne, who couldn't say boo to a&#10;goose.

And though she does not come of such&#10;good blood as the Malonys or Molloys, let me tell ye, she's of an&#10;ancient family that any nobleman might be proud to marry into.&quot;&#10;&#10;But before she had come to such a resolution and determined to&#10;subjugate Major Dobbin by her endearments, it must be owned that&#10;Glorvina had practised them a good deal elsewhere.  She had had a&#10;season in Dublin, and who knows how many in Cork, Killarney, and&#10;Mallow? She had flirted with all the marriageable officers whom the&#10;depots of her country afforded, and all the bachelor squires who seemed&#10;eligible.

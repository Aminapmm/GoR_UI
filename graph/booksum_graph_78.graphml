    <node id="The actions of Diomede and Ulysses against Minerva's temple marked a turning point in the Grecian attempts to save themselves because they had been relying solely on Minerva's aid in their war against Troy. By desecrating the temple, killing the guards, and stealing Minerva's statue, Diomede and Ulysses committed an impious act that angered the goddess and led to her withdrawal of support.&#10;&#10;This event was directly linked to the Grecians' misfortune, as the text notes that &quot;from thence the tide of fortune left their shore&quot; and that they lost their courage. It also created a prophecy requiring a virgin's blood for the Greeks to safely return home, adding an extra layer of desperation.&#10;&#10;Minerva's abandonment weakened the Grecians, making them more vulnerable to defeat, and it was only through Ulysses' cunning manipulation that they managed to rally their troops again. However, this incident certainly marked a turning point in their fortunes, showcasing how human actions could impact divine intervention and alter the course of events in the Trojan War." />

    <node id="In Book II of the narrative, it is revealed that Odysseus (also known as Ulysses) played a crucial role in ensuring that the Trojans would bring the wooden horse into their city. The Greeks had built a large wooden horse, and Odysseus hid inside it along with several other soldiers. Before this, however, Odysseus employed deceits to gain the trust of the Trojans.&#10;&#10;First, he pretended to be a captured Greek who warned the Trojans about the horse being a trap, but in reality, he was providing more reasons for the Trojans to bring the horse into their city as a spoil of war. He claimed that the Greeks built the large structure to appease Minerva (Athena) after stealing her statue and desecrating her temple, which directly led to their misfortunes in the war. Odysseus further stated that if the Trojans kept the horse outside their walls, it would ensure their victory; but if they brought it into the city, Troy would be destroyed. This clever deception played on the religious beliefs and fears of the Trojans, making it more likely for them to accept the horse as a peace offering and bring it inside their walls.&#10;&#10;Odysseus's ploy worked, and the Trojans fell for the ruse, ultimately leading to the destruction of Troy. This event demonstrates how human actions, such as Odysseus's deceitful measures, can impact divine intervention and alter the course of events in the Trojan War." />

    <node id="1. National pride and loyalty: The Trojans are motivated by their love for their city, Troy, and their desire to protect it from destruction. This is evident in their resolve to fight despite knowing that they are likely going to lose the war.&#10;&#10;2. Fear of disgrace: The Trojans fear the shame of losing their city and being conquered by their enemies. They believe that surrendering would mean humiliation and loss of honor, which drives them to continue resisting even in the face of overwhelming odds.&#10;&#10;3. Revenge: Some Trojans, like Hector, are driven by a desire for revenge against the Greeks who have caused so much pain and suffering to their people. They want to make sure that the sacrifices made by their friends and family members will not be in vain.&#10;&#10;4. Hope for divine intervention: Although the text mentions that the gods have turned away from supporting the Trojans, some characters still hold on to the belief that they might receive divine assistance at the last moment. This hope keeps them going and gives them the strength to carry on fighting.&#10;&#10;5. Deception and manipulation: As described in the narrative, Odysseus uses deception to trick the Trojans into bringing the wooden horse into their city, further fueling their determination to defend themselves against what they perceive as a Greek trap.&#10;&#10;These motivations, combined with the natural human instinct for survival, drive the Trojans to continue fighting even when they are forewarned of their defeat and the gods no longer support them in their struggle." />

    <node id="The passage describes a scene where the Trojans are stripping the slain Greek soldiers and defeating those who have straggled from their main forces. Some Greek soldiers even retreat to their ships or hide in the wooden horse due to the Trojans' success. However, this victory is short-lived as the prophetess Cassandra, who had been warning about the dangers of the Greeks, is dragged away by her hair and ultimately cannot prevent the impending doom of Troy despite her cries for help. The Trojans' initial victory here does not change the fact that they have brought the wooden horse into their city, which will eventually lead to their downfall." />

    <node id="Coroebus, a Trojan leader, decided to have the Greeian arms switched for the Trojans' use in order to deceive the Greeks and gain an advantage in the war. They implemented this switch by dressing themselves in the spoils of a dead Greek warrior named Androgeos, including his upper vest, painted buckler, and plumy crest. This plan backfired when their own allies, mistaking them for Greeks due to the switched armor, pelted them with stones from the temple's height, causing casualties among the Trojans. The Grecians took advantage of the chaos and rallied their troops, renewing the fight. This incident marked a turning point in the Trojan War, as it demonstrated how human actions could impact divine intervention and alter the course of events." />

    <node id="In the scene described, you can visualize the chaos and destruction of Troy as the avenging deities wreak havoc. Neptune, the god of the sea, is depicted causing ruin at the foundation of the building by driving his mace below the wall's base, thereby heaving the structure from its solid base. The goddess Juno, representing marriage and childbirth but also a powerful force in the Trojan War, stands &quot;Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands, urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.&quot; This implies that she is rallying and spurring the Greek soldiers to advance further into the city.&#10;&#10;Pallas, or Athena, the goddess of wisdom, craft, and warfare, takes pride by bestriding the tower and being seen as refulgent through the cloud, demonstrating her protective presence over the Greeks. Lastly, Jove, also known as Zeus, the king of all gods, is supplying new courage to the foe, ensuring that they have the necessary strength and motivation to continue their assault on Troy." />

    <node id="The Trojans planned to clear the palace from the foe and avenge the dead by making a second attempt to confront the Greeks who had infiltrated the palace. They did this by rallying their courage and running &quot;to tempt their death,&quot; as described in the passage. &#10;&#10;To make a last stand, they chose a postern door leading to the king's closet and a tower. This location was significant because it was known to Hector's wife, Andromache, who had used it to bring Astyanax, her son, to see his grandparents without being observed. By gathering at this point, the Trojans could defend a narrow passage and protect the king, as well as damage the enemy with beams, rafters, and heavy stones from the tower.

I see the Grecian fleet,&#10;And all their sails employ'd, in prospect fair;&#10;And now, a dismal blank, the desart shore,&#10;Without a sail, without a ship, is spread.&#10;Meantime, Antenor, with his princely son,&#10;Helenus, and young Agenor, go&#10;In embassy to Diomede, to treat&#10;Of terms of peace; where they, resolv'd to grant&#10;Whate'er we ask, restore the captive Greeks,&#10;And add fair prizes from their own rich stores.&#10;But neither hope of safety, nor the fear&#10;Of dire destruction, could my troubled soul&#10;Subdue: I stood alone; and ev'n in sleep&#10;Could find no rest: when, lo! a pleasing dream&#10;In silent vision pass'd before my eyes:&#10;A spacious grove I saw, o'erspread with green,&#10;And mutt'rer'd by the murmurs of a rill,&#10;That, wand'ring from its fount, here lick'd the roots&#10;Of each proud tree, and there flow'd in a stream:&#10;A matron venerable sat alone,&#10;Under a poplar, which her head had wove&#10;With garlands; at her feet a lion's whelp&#10;Lay panting, loving at his nurse's breast.&#10;She raised her eyes to heaven; she stretch'd her hands&#10;To Jove, the guardian of the sacred rites:&#10;&quot;O god! whose powerful arm,&quot; she cried, &quot;can save,&#10;And cast in ruin headlong all below,&#10;What god,&quot; said she, &quot;what power can make me bear&#10;These pains? I cannot bear them; but relieve&#10;My heart oppress'd with grief. For pity sake,&#10;Restore the Trojans to their ancient seat,&#10;And let my Anchises there possess his woods.&quot;&#10;She spoke: and straight a voice from heaven replied:&#10;&quot;Go, Trojan dame, thy pray'r is heard; and go&#10;With joy: for thou shalt see thine own country freed&#10;From Greek destruction, and the Grecian power&#10;Subdued beneath. Fear not: my faithful care&#10;Shall guard thee from alarms by sea or land.&#10;Take thou this oak; and on that happy shore&#10;Which Jove design'd for thee, plant it around:&#10;Then shalt thou joy to see thy son rever'd&#10;By lands and nations; and, thro' future times,&#10;Fam'd for his race, which shall great honor gain.&quot;&#10;She ceas'd; and I awoke with inward joy:&#10;Yet still my anxious thoughts no rest could find.&#10;For now the sun was set, and night approach'd,&#10;Dark, long, and dismal; when, behold, above&#10;My head, in the clear air, appear a flame;&#10;A lambent fire, that gently play'd around&#10;The lofty top of young Iulus' head.&#10;My father saw it too; and, with his hands&#10;Extended to the sky, these words he spoke:&#10;&quot;Take heart, my son; nor let thy mind be mov'd&#10;With doubtful fears: for sure some god appears:&#10;This is a sign, most certain, from above.&quot;&#10;Thus saying, to his arms he takes his son,&#10;And bears him trembling to the sacred flames.&#10;The fire increas'd; and lively blaz'd around,&#10;As if it would have encompassed all.&#10;&#10;ANSWER:&#10;In the passage provided, the old man referred to is Priam, the former king of Troy. Despite the pleas of his family, he insists on dying for his fallen city because he feels responsible for its destruction and wants to uphold his role as a protector of Troy. He also believes that doing so would prevent any further harm from coming to his family, even though it may put them at risk initially. Furthermore, Priam's decision is driven by his strong sense of national pride and loyalty towards Troy, which motivates him to choose an honorable death over surrender." />

    <node id="Polites was one of Priam's sons who was pursued and killed by Pyrrhus in the chaos of the sack of Troy. In the narrative, Polites is depicted as fleeing through swords and foes, with Pyrrhus chasing him and eventually killing him. The tragic scene unfolds before Priam's eyes, leading to his own desperate state at an altar within the burning palace.&#10;&#10;Priam's reaction to his son's death is one of anger and despair, shaking more with anger than with age as he cries out for justice from the gods against Pyrrhus' brutal rage. He feels a sense of helplessness, lamenting that there is no hope left but death, and urging his family to accept their fate rather than trying to flee or hide.&#10;&#10;The story highlights the tragic end of Troy and its royal family, with Priam accepting his own inevitable demise as he resolves to die fighting rather than witnessing any more destruction. The image of Polites' death at the hands of Pyrrhus is a poignant reminder of the brutality and chaos of war, and the deep sense of loss and despair that it brings upon its victims." />

    <node id="The passage describes a chaotic and violent scene within the city of Troy during a stormy night, as the Trojans make a desperate attempt to clear their palace of hidden Greek soldiers. Both Trojans and Greeks suffer losses in this conflict, marked by confusion and fear. The Trojans, led by Coroebus, had earlier switched to using Greek armor to deceive the enemy, but this backfired when their own allies mistook them for Greeks and attacked, causing casualties among their ranks.&#10;&#10;In response to the infiltration of the palace, the Trojans decide to make a second stand against the Greeks by gathering at a narrow postern door leading to the king's closet and a tower. This location is significant as it was once used by Hector's wife, Andromache, to bring her son Astyanax to see his grandparents without being observed. By positioning themselves here, the Trojans aim to protect their king, control a tight passage, and use beams, rafters, and heavy stones from the tower to damage the enemy.&#10;&#10;The scene is further enflamed by avenging deities such as Neptune, Juno, Pallas Athena, and Jove (Zeus), who contribute to the chaos and destruction in Troy. Loud laments, cries, and shrieks fill the palace as the Trojans break down doors and make a mighty breach, revealing hidden rooms filled with Greek soldiers and maids.&#10;&#10;The stormy night sets the stage for this intense and bloody confrontation between the Trojans and Greeks, where both sides suffer casualties due to human error and divine intervention, ultimately deciding the outcome of the battle and leading to the downfall of Troy." />
    <node id="The old man, Priam, tells the story of how Pyrrhus treated his father in relation to the death of his son Hector by comparing it to his own experience with Pyrrhus. According to Priam, when Hector was killed, Pyrrhus' father, Achilles, showed respect for Hector and his father by returning Hector's body to them, following proper burial rites. However, Pyrrhus himself does not show the same respect or reverence for the laws of nations and gods, as he kills Polites, one of Priam's sons, in front of him.&#10;&#10;Priam contrasts Pyrrhus' actions with those of his vaunted sire, Achilles, who feared the gods and respected the laws of nations. He laments that Pyrrhus takes delight in inflicting pain and suffering on a father by killing his son, something that Achilles would never have done. By making this comparison, Priam emphasizes the stark contrast between the behavior of Pyrrhus and that of his father, highlighting the former's brutal and disrespectful treatment of both Polites and himself." />

With that he dragg'd the trembling sire,&#10;  Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,&#10;  (The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)&#10;  Haul'd from beneath the violated shade," />
    <node id="The significant event that occurred on this day was the fall of Troy. The Greeks, led by Odysseus, had built a large wooden horse called &quot;Minerva's fabric&quot; and hid several soldiers inside it. They left the horse as a gift to the Trojans after pretending to retreat. Believing the horse to be a peace offering, the Trojans brought it into their city, unaware that they were allowing their enemies into the city. Once night fell, the Greek soldiers hidden in the horse emerged and opened the gates of Troy, allowing the rest of the Greek army, which had returned under the cover of darkness, to enter and sack the city. This event is significant because it marked the end of the Trojan War and the fulfillment of the prophecy that Troy would be destroyed by the Greeks hiding within a wooden horse." />
    <node id="1. The city of Troy is in ruins and on fire, with invading foes overrunning the palace of Priam.&#10;2. Hecuba, the queen of Troy, is seeking shelter near an altar with a doddered laurel tree, along with other Trojan women and her husband Priam.&#10;3. Priam is depicted as trying to put on armor with feeble shoulders, but his aged body cannot sustain the weight. He moves in pain, hoping to be slain instead of witnessing the destruction of his kingdom.&#10;4. Polites, one of Priam's sons, is pursued by Pyrrhus and runs towards the laurel tree for safety.&#10;5. The situation is desperate as Polites is transfix'd with a lance and expires before his father's eyes, causing Priam to shake with anger more than age.&#10;6. Hecuba expresses concern over Priam's rage and attempts to calm him down by reminding him of the ineffectiveness of arms against their current situation. She also highlights the fact that Hector would not be able to save them even if he were present, emphasizing their helplessness." />
    <node id="1. Hector's ghost warned Aeneas about the dire situation in Troy, emphasizing that it was time for him to escape the flames and horrors of the city's imminent fall. He advised Aeneas that Troy had paid enough tribute to Priam's royal name and that further resistance would be futile.&#10;   &#10;2. Hector urged Aeneas to accept Troy's fate and take responsibility for its future, as well as the safety of its gods. The statue of Vesta and other divine relics were given to him as symbols of their protection and patronage during his journey.&#10;   &#10;3. Additionally, Hector reminded Aeneas of the importance of seeking assistance from the gods in building new walls, which would eventually become part of the city he was destined to establish. In essence, Hector's ghost advised Aeneas to ensure the survival of Troy's gods and people by accepting the inevitability of Troy's destruction and focusing on creating a new future for them all." />
    <node id="The speaker is expressing a desire to reveal the secrets of the Greeks (the guilty state) and punish them, presumably for their impious act against Minerva's temple. However, they are aware that doing so could be considered a crime. To reconcile this dilemma, the speaker proposes an alliance with the king, offering to reveal Greek secrets and betray the Greeks in exchange for the king's protection and the safety of his empire.&#10;&#10;The theft of Minerva's image by Diomede and Ulysses marked a turning point in the Grecians' fortunes, leading to Minerva's withdrawal of support and the beginning of their downfall. The speaker acknowledges that the Greeks' hopes and attempts were based on Minerva's aid, implying that the loss of her favor significantly weakened their position in the war.&#10;&#10;In order to ensure the safety of both himself and the king's empire, the speaker must carefully navigate this complex situation. By aligning himself with the Trojans and providing valuable intelligence on the Greeks, he can contribute to the Trojan cause while minimizing the risk of committing a crime. This strategy may help restore balance and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for both the speaker and the Trojans." />

    <node id="In the text, Pyrrhus leads the Greeks in a violent attack on Priam's palace, resulting in the deaths of many Trojan defenders and filling the apartments with Greek soldiers. This event is described in the supporting materials provided, but it is also alluded to in the passage you quote. The &quot;fatal work&quot; of Pyrrhus refers to his ruthless killing of the Trojans who attempt to resist him. The Greeks &quot;rush in&quot; and kill those few defenders they find, while the apartments of the palace are filled with Greek soldiers. This scene mirrors an earlier episode described in the supporting materials, where Achilles killed Hector but still respected Priam and returned his body for proper burial. Pyrrhus, however, does not show this same reverence for the laws of nations or gods, as he kills Polites in front of his father and shows no remorse." />
    <node id="The fatal decision made by Coroebus and the Trojans was to implement a deception strategy against the Greeks by wearing the spoils of a dead Greek warrior named Androgeos, including his upper vest, painted buckler, and plumy crest. This plan backfired when their own allies, mistaking them for Greeks due to the switched armor, pelted them with stones from the temple's height, causing casualties among the Trojans.&#10;&#10;To carry out this decision, Coroebus and the other Trojans dressed themselves in Androgeos' armor, believing that Fortune had led them to find these Grecian arms for their destruction and the Trojans' benefit. They hoped that fraud would supply the want of force in war by deceiving the enemy into thinking they were Greeks. However, this decision ultimately resulted in confusion and friendly fire casualties among the Trojan ranks." />
    <node id="The narrator's despair is caused by the realization that their companion, Euryalus, is missing. Although all other companions have gathered at Ceres' seat, Euryalus is nowhere to be found. This absence prompts the narrator to accuse both gods and men in their distress, indicating their suspicion that something terrible might have happened to Euryalus. The narrator's strong emotional reaction, characterized by despair and rage, highlights the close bond between them and Euryalus.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly mention Euryalus being lost during the meeting at Ceres' seat. However, the passage implies that his absence is conspicuous and significant enough to cause the narrator's anguish: &quot;But she was lost for ever to my sight...

    <node id="In the narrative, Priam, the former king of Troy, meets a pitiful fate as he stands unarmed and despairing at an altar within his burning palace. The city is on fire, and invading foes have overrun the palace. Despite not being used to arms, Priam tries to put on armor, but his aged body cannot sustain the weight. He moves in pain, hoping to be slain instead of witnessing the destruction of his kingdom.&#10;&#10;The altar near a laurel tree is also a refuge for Polites, one of Priam's sons, who is pursued by Pyrrhus and eventually killed before his father's eyes. This tragic event causes Priam to shake with anger more than age, highlighting his despair and anger at the situation.&#10;&#10;Hecuba, the queen of Troy, tries to calm Priam down by reminding him that arms are ineffective against their current situation. She also points out that Hector's presence would not make a difference, emphasizing their helplessness. Overall, Priam faces a tragic end as he accepts his own inevitable demise and resolves to die fighting rather than witnessing any more destruction." />
    <node id="The Trojans' situation changed from favorable to unfavorable due to their own actions in celebrating their victory over the Greeks and implementing a deception strategy. The Trojans mistakenly believed that they had defeated the Greeks, not realizing that many Greek soldiers had retreated to their ships or hidden in the wooden horse. In their excitement, the Trojans committed several fateful errors.&#10;&#10;Firstly, they brought the wooden horse into their city as a trophy, unaware that it housed Greek soldiers who would later destroy them from within. Secondly, Coroebus and other Trojans made the disastrous decision to wear the spoils of a dead Greek warrior named Androgeos in a deception strategy. This plan backfired when their own allies, mistaking them for Greeks due to the switched armor, pelted them with stones from the temple's height, causing casualties among the Trojans.&#10;&#10;These actions led Pallas (Athena) to turn against the Trojans, refusing them her aid and support. The prophetess Cassandra warned of the dangers but was ignored, resulting in the impending doom of Troy. The Trojans then had no choice but to postpone any hope for conquest, turn to prayer, and await a more favorable opportunity to return to Greece with Pallas's approval, as foretold by Calchas." />

    <node id="The significant event that led the Greeks to consider leaving the siege of Troy was when Diomede and Ulysses desecrated Minerva's temple. They committed an impious act by killing the guards, stealing Minerva's statue, and angering the goddess, which led to her withdrawal of support. This event marked a turning point in the Grecian attempts to save themselves as they had been relying solely on Minerva's aid in their war against Troy.&#10;&#10;The ominous sign that made them change their minds was when they realized the consequences of their actions - Minerva's abandonment weakened the Grecians, making them more vulnerable to defeat. To remedy this situation, Ulysses had to use his cunning manipulation to rally their troops again. This incident showcased how human actions could impact divine intervention and alter the course of events in the Trojan War." />
    <node id="Laocoon, a Trojan priest, was one of the few individuals who suspected the Greek horse to be a trick. He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears as many Trojans had already been convinced by Odysseus' earlier deceitful speech and did not want to offend the gods by destroying what they believed was Minerva's fabric.&#10;&#10;Laocoon's actions also attempt to expose the truth about the horse, as he throws a spear at it in an effort to prove that it is not sacred or protected by the goddess Minerva. However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness." />
    <node id="The text does not provide direct information about what happens to the speaker after Leucothea leaves him. However, based on the narrative's context and the speaker's state of mind, it can be inferred that he continues to struggle with the difficult situation he is in as a Greek among Trojans.&#10;&#10;Leucothea, in her divine wisdom, had advised the speaker to abandon his old allegiances and join the Trojans, offering him protection during his escape from the Greeks. Once Leucothea leaves, the speaker remains on his own, having to rely on his wits and the alliance he proposed to the Trojan king.&#10;&#10;Given that the speaker is aware of valuable Greek secrets, it can be assumed that he uses this information to help the Trojans, contributing to their cause while minimizing personal risk. This strategy may lead him further into the inner circle of Trojan leadership and provide a sense of safety despite his initial desperation when Leucothea found him.&#10;&#10;In summary, after Leucothea leaves, the speaker likely continues to navigate the complex situation by sharing Greek secrets with the Trojans in exchange for their protection. This action may help restore balance in the conflict, ultimately proving beneficial for both the speaker and the Trojans." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, there is no mention of an encounter between Androgeos and a group of Greeks upon their arrival on the shore. The narrative only mentions that Coroebus and other Trojans later wore Androgeos' armor in a deception strategy, which backfired when their own allies mistook them for Greeks and pelted them with stones from the temple's height, causing casualties among the Trojans." />
    <node id="The Trojans' decision to ignore Laocoon's warnings and bring the wooden horse into their city ultimately leads to the fall of Troy. The horse, built by the Greeks as a ploy to enter the city, houses several Greek soldiers who later emerge at night, opening the gates for the rest of the Greek army hiding outside the city walls. This combined force then sacks the city, marking the end of the Trojan War and the fulfillment of the prophecy that Troy would be destroyed by Greeks hiding within a wooden horse.&#10;&#10;In summary, when the people of Troy ignore Laocoon's warnings and bring the wooden horse into their city, they unknowingly allow their enemies to infiltrate and destroy them from within, leading to the downfall of Troy." />
    <node id="Odysseus, also known as Ulysses, employed a cunning deception to ensure that the Trojans would bring the wooden horse into their city. He disguised himself as a captured Greek and infiltrated the Trojan ranks, warning them about the wooden horse being a trap. However, his warnings were designed to deceive further, convincing the Trojans that keeping the horse outside their walls would guarantee victory while bringing it inside the city would lead to Troy's destruction.&#10;&#10;Odysseus claimed that the Greeks built the large structure to appease Minerva (Athena) after stealing her statue and desecrating her temple, making it more likely for the Trojans to accept the horse as a peace offering. He stated that if the Trojans kept the horse outside their walls, it would ensure their victory; but if they brought it into the city, Troy would be destroyed. This strategy played on the religious beliefs and fears of the Trojans, ultimately leading them to fall for the ruse.&#10;&#10;The predicted consequences for bringing the wooden horse into their city were that the Greeks hiding inside would emerge at night, open the gates for the rest of the Greek army hiding outside the city walls, and sack Troy, marking the end of the Trojan War and the fulfillment of the prophecy that Troy would be destroyed by the Greeks hiding within a wooden horse." />

The narrator's strong emotional reaction, characterized by despair and rage, highlights the close bond between them and Euryalus.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly mention Euryalus being lost during the meeting at Ceres' seat. However, the passage implies that his absence is conspicuous and significant enough to cause the narrator's anguish: &quot;But she was lost for ever to my sight...

Here, the 'she' refers to Euryalus.&#10;&#10;In summary, the narrator's despair and departure from their friends at Ceres' seat is due to the disturbing absence of Euryalus, leading them to fear for his safety and wellbeing.">

He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears as many Trojans had already been convinced by Odysseus' earlier deceitful speech and did not want to offend the gods by destroying what they believed was Minerva's fabric.&#10;&#10;Laocoon's actions also attempt to expose the truth about the horse, as he throws a spear at it in an effort to prove that it is not sacred or protected by the goddess Minerva. However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness.">

They implemented this switch by dressing themselves in the spoils of a dead Greek warrior named Androgeos, including his upper vest, painted buckler, and plumy crest. This plan backfired when their own allies, mistaking them for Greeks due to the switched armor, pelted them with stones from the temple's height, causing casualties among the Trojans. The Grecians took advantage of the chaos and rallied their troops, renewing the fight. This incident marked a turning point in the Trojan War, as it demonstrated how human actions could impact divine intervention and alter the course of events.">

Both Trojans and Greeks suffer losses in this conflict, marked by confusion and fear. The Trojans, led by Coroebus, had earlier switched to using Greek armor to deceive the enemy, but this backfired when their own allies mistook them for Greeks and attacked, causing casualties among their ranks.&#10;&#10;In response to the infiltration of the palace, the Trojans decide to make a second stand against the Greeks by gathering at a narrow postern door leading to the king's closet and a tower. This location is significant as it was once used by Hector's wife, Andromache, to bring her son Astyanax to see his grandparents without being observed. By positioning themselves here, the Trojans aim to protect their king, control a tight passage, and use beams, rafters, and heavy stones from the tower to damage the enemy.&#10;&#10;The scene is further enflamed by avenging deities such as Neptune, Juno, Pallas Athena, and Jove (Zeus), who contribute to the chaos and destruction in Troy. Loud laments, cries, and shrieks fill the palace as the Trojans break down doors and make a mighty breach, revealing hidden rooms filled with Greek soldiers and maids.&#10;&#10;The stormy night sets the stage for this intense and bloody confrontation between the Trojans and Greeks, where both sides suffer casualties due to human error and divine intervention, ultimately deciding the outcome of the battle and leading to the downfall of Troy.">

The Trojans' initial victory here does not change the fact that they have brought the wooden horse into their city, which will eventually lead to their downfall." target="Laocoon, a Trojan priest, was one of the few individuals who suspected the Greek horse to be a trick. He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears as many Trojans had already been convinced by Odysseus' earlier deceitful speech and did not want to offend the gods by destroying what they believed was Minerva's fabric.&#10;&#10;Laocoon's actions also attempt to expose the truth about the horse, as he throws a spear at it in an effort to prove that it is not sacred or protected by the goddess Minerva. However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness.">

This location was significant because it was known to Hector's wife, Andromache, who had used it to bring Astyanax, her son, to see his grandparents without being observed. By gathering at this point, the Trojans could defend a narrow passage and protect the king, as well as damage the enemy with beams, rafters, and heavy stones from the tower.

He also believes that doing so would prevent any further harm from coming to his family, even though it may put them at risk initially. Furthermore, Priam's decision is driven by his strong sense of national pride and loyalty towards Troy, which motivates him to choose an honorable death over surrender.">

He feels a sense of helplessness, lamenting that there is no hope left but death, and urging his family to accept their fate rather than trying to flee or hide.&#10;&#10;The story highlights the tragic end of Troy and its royal family, with Priam accepting his own inevitable demise as he resolves to die fighting rather than witnessing any more destruction. The image of Polites' death at the hands of Pyrrhus is a poignant reminder of the brutality and chaos of war, and the deep sense of loss and despair that it brings upon its victims.">

According to Priam, when Hector was killed, Pyrrhus' father, Achilles, showed respect for Hector and his father by returning Hector's body to them, following proper burial rites. However, Pyrrhus himself does not show the same respect or reverence for the laws of nations and gods, as he kills Polites, one of Priam's sons, in front of him.&#10;&#10;Priam contrasts Pyrrhus' actions with those of his vaunted sire, Achilles, who feared the gods and respected the laws of nations. He laments that Pyrrhus takes delight in inflicting pain and suffering on a father by killing his son, something that Achilles would never have done. By making this comparison, Priam emphasizes the stark contrast between the behavior of Pyrrhus and that of his father, highlighting the former's brutal and disrespectful treatment of both Polites and himself.">

He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears as many Trojans had already been convinced by Odysseus' earlier deceitful speech and did not want to offend the gods by destroying what they believed was Minerva's fabric.&#10;&#10;Laocoon's actions also attempt to expose the truth about the horse, as he throws a spear at it in an effort to prove that it is not sacred or protected by the goddess Minerva. However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness.">

Once Leucothea leaves, the speaker remains on his own, having to rely on his wits and the alliance he proposed to the Trojan king.&#10;&#10;Given that the speaker is aware of valuable Greek secrets, it can be assumed that he uses this information to help the Trojans, contributing to their cause while minimizing personal risk. This strategy may lead him further into the inner circle of Trojan leadership and provide a sense of safety despite his initial desperation when Leucothea found him.&#10;&#10;In summary, after Leucothea leaves, the speaker likely continues to navigate the complex situation by sharing Greek secrets with the Trojans in exchange for their protection.

The Trojans, led by Coroebus, had earlier switched to using Greek armor to deceive the enemy, but this backfired when their own allies mistook them for Greeks and attacked, causing casualties among their ranks.&#10;&#10;In response to the infiltration of the palace, the Trojans decide to make a second stand against the Greeks by gathering at a narrow postern door leading to the king's closet and a tower. This location is significant as it was once used by Hector's wife, Andromache, to bring her son Astyanax to see his grandparents without being observed. By positioning themselves here, the Trojans aim to protect their king, control a tight passage, and use beams, rafters, and heavy stones from the tower to damage the enemy.&#10;&#10;The scene is further enflamed by avenging deities such as Neptune, Juno, Pallas Athena, and Jove (Zeus), who contribute to the chaos and destruction in Troy. Loud laments, cries, and shrieks fill the palace as the Trojans break down doors and make a mighty breach, revealing hidden rooms filled with Greek soldiers and maids.&#10;&#10;The stormy night sets the stage for this intense and bloody confrontation between the Trojans and Greeks, where both sides suffer casualties due to human error and divine intervention, ultimately deciding the outcome of the battle and leading to the downfall of Troy.">

    <edge source="In the scene described, you can visualize the chaos and destruction of Troy as the avenging deities wreak havoc. Neptune, the god of the sea, is depicted causing ruin at the foundation of the building by driving his mace below the wall's base, thereby heaving the structure from its solid base. The goddess Juno, representing marriage and childbirth but also a powerful force in the Trojan War, stands &quot;Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands, urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.&quot; This implies that she is rallying and spurring the Greek soldiers to advance further into the city.&#10;&#10;Pallas, or Athena, the goddess of wisdom, craft, and warfare, takes pride by bestriding the tower and being seen as refulgent through the cloud, demonstrating her protective presence over the Greeks. Lastly, Jove, also known as Zeus, the king of all gods, is supplying new courage to the foe, ensuring that they have the necessary strength and motivation to continue their assault on Troy." target="The significant event that led the Greeks to consider leaving the siege of Troy was when Diomede and Ulysses desecrated Minerva's temple. They committed an impious act by killing the guards, stealing Minerva's statue, and angering the goddess, which led to her withdrawal of support. This event marked a turning point in the Grecian attempts to save themselves as they had been relying solely on Minerva's aid in their war against Troy.&#10;&#10;The ominous sign that made them change their minds was when they realized the consequences of their actions - Minerva's abandonment weakened the Grecians, making them more vulnerable to defeat. To remedy this situation, Ulysses had to use his cunning manipulation to rally their troops again. This incident showcased how human actions could impact divine intervention and alter the course of events in the Trojan War.">

He also believes that doing so would prevent any further harm from coming to his family, even though it may put them at risk initially. Furthermore, Priam's decision is driven by his strong sense of national pride and loyalty towards Troy, which motivates him to choose an honorable death over surrender.">

He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears as many Trojans had already been convinced by Odysseus' earlier deceitful speech and did not want to offend the gods by destroying what they believed was Minerva's fabric.&#10;&#10;Laocoon's actions also attempt to expose the truth about the horse, as he throws a spear at it in an effort to prove that it is not sacred or protected by the goddess Minerva. However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness.">

He also believes that doing so would prevent any further harm from coming to his family, even though it may put them at risk initially. Furthermore, Priam's decision is driven by his strong sense of national pride and loyalty towards Troy, which motivates him to choose an honorable death over surrender.">

This scene mirrors an earlier episode described in the supporting materials, where Achilles killed Hector but still respected Priam and returned his body for proper burial. Pyrrhus, however, does not show this same reverence for the laws of nations or gods, as he kills Polites in front of his father and shows no remorse.">

However, based on the narrative's context and the speaker's state of mind, it can be inferred that he continues to struggle with the difficult situation he is in as a Greek among Trojans.&#10;&#10;Leucothea, in her divine wisdom, had advised the speaker to abandon his old allegiances and join the Trojans, offering him protection during his escape from the Greeks. Once Leucothea leaves, the speaker remains on his own, having to rely on his wits and the alliance he proposed to the Trojan king.&#10;&#10;Given that the speaker is aware of valuable Greek secrets, it can be assumed that he uses this information to help the Trojans, contributing to their cause while minimizing personal risk. This strategy may lead him further into the inner circle of Trojan leadership and provide a sense of safety despite his initial desperation when Leucothea found him.&#10;&#10;In summary, after Leucothea leaves, the speaker likely continues to navigate the complex situation by sharing Greek secrets with the Trojans in exchange for their protection. This action may help restore balance in the conflict, ultimately proving beneficial for both the speaker and the Trojans.">

By positioning themselves here, the Trojans aim to protect their king, control a tight passage, and use beams, rafters, and heavy stones from the tower to damage the enemy.&#10;&#10;The scene is further enflamed by avenging deities such as Neptune, Juno, Pallas Athena, and Jove (Zeus), who contribute to the chaos and destruction in Troy. Loud laments, cries, and shrieks fill the palace as the Trojans break down doors and make a mighty breach, revealing hidden rooms filled with Greek soldiers and maids.&#10;&#10;The stormy night sets the stage for this intense and bloody confrontation between the Trojans and Greeks, where both sides suffer casualties due to human error and divine intervention, ultimately deciding the outcome of the battle and leading to the downfall of Troy." target="The fatal decision made by Coroebus and the Trojans was to implement a deception strategy against the Greeks by wearing the spoils of a dead Greek warrior named Androgeos, including his upper vest, painted buckler, and plumy crest.

He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city.

However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness.">

    <edge source="The significant event that occurred on this day was the fall of Troy. The Greeks, led by Odysseus, had built a large wooden horse called &quot;Minerva's fabric&quot; and hid several soldiers inside it. They left the horse as a gift to the Trojans after pretending to retreat. Believing the horse to be a peace offering, the Trojans brought it into their city, unaware that they were allowing their enemies into the city. Once night fell, the Greek soldiers hidden in the horse emerged and opened the gates of Troy, allowing the rest of the Greek army, which had returned under the cover of darkness, to enter and sack the city. This event is significant because it marked the end of the Trojan War and the fulfillment of the prophecy that Troy would be destroyed by the Greeks hiding within a wooden horse." target="Odysseus, also known as Ulysses, employed a cunning deception to ensure that the Trojans would bring the wooden horse into their city. He disguised himself as a captured Greek and infiltrated the Trojan ranks, warning them about the wooden horse being a trap. However, his warnings were designed to deceive further, convincing the Trojans that keeping the horse outside their walls would guarantee victory while bringing it inside the city would lead to Troy's destruction.&#10;&#10;Odysseus claimed that the Greeks built the large structure to appease Minerva (Athena) after stealing her statue and desecrating her temple, making it more likely for the Trojans to accept the horse as a peace offering. He stated that if the Trojans kept the horse outside their walls, it would ensure their victory; but if they brought it into the city, Troy would be destroyed. This strategy played on the religious beliefs and fears of the Trojans, ultimately leading them to fall for the ruse.&#10;&#10;The predicted consequences for bringing the wooden horse into their city were that the Greeks hiding inside would emerge at night, open the gates for the rest of the Greek army hiding outside the city walls, and sack Troy, marking the end of the Trojan War and the fulfillment of the prophecy that Troy would be destroyed by the Greeks hiding within a wooden horse.">

He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city.

Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse.

The city is on fire, and invading foes have overrun the palace. Despite not being used to arms, Priam tries to put on armor, but his aged body cannot sustain the weight. He moves in pain, hoping to be slain instead of witnessing the destruction of his kingdom.&#10;&#10;The altar near a laurel tree is also a refuge for Polites, one of Priam's sons, who is pursued by Pyrrhus and eventually killed before his father's eyes. This tragic event causes Priam to shake with anger more than age, highlighting his despair and anger at the situation.&#10;&#10;Hecuba, the queen of Troy, tries to calm Priam down by reminding him that arms are ineffective against their current situation. She also points out that Hector's presence would not make a difference, emphasizing their helplessness.

    <edge source="Laocoon, a Trojan priest, was one of the few individuals who suspected the Greek horse to be a trick. He warned the other Trojans not to trust the Greeks and advised them to burn the wooden horse or throw it into the sea. However, his warnings were ignored by most Trojans due to Odysseus' earlier deception about the horse being a peace offering.&#10;&#10;The significance of Laocoon's speech lies in his attempt to prevent the fall of Troy by raising awareness of the Greeks' deceptive plan. His words reflected his skepticism towards accepting the horse as a gift and highlighted the potential dangers it posed to the city. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears as many Trojans had already been convinced by Odysseus' earlier deceitful speech and did not want to offend the gods by destroying what they believed was Minerva's fabric.&#10;&#10;Laocoon's actions also attempt to expose the truth about the horse, as he throws a spear at it in an effort to prove that it is not sacred or protected by the goddess Minerva. However, this act fails to change the minds of the Trojans and further infuriates Athena, who punishes Laocoon and his sons with serpentine monsters for daring to defile her &quot;gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;The failure of Laocoon's speech and actions can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the Trojans had already been manipulated by Odysseus' earlier deception and were hesitant to question the authenticity of the horse as a peace offering. Secondly, Laocoon's status as a priest did not carry enough weight to overturn the decision made by the majority of Trojans, who were convinced that accepting the horse would bring them victory. Lastly, the intervention of the gods in punishing Laocoon and his sons further solidified the belief among the Trojans that the horse was indeed sacred and should not be harmed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Laocoon's speech and actions highlight his efforts to prevent the fall of Troy by warning the Trojans about the true nature of the Greek horse. However, they fail due to a combination of earlier deception, reluctance from the Trojans to question the authenticity of the horse, and divine intervention that reinforced the belief in the horse's sacredness." target="The Trojans' decision to ignore Laocoon's warnings and bring the wooden horse into their city ultimately leads to the fall of Troy.

    <node id="Peter has been out of school for only two years. After getting his degree, he joined an electrical manufacturing company for a post-graduate training program. However, Lexington refers to this experience as being &quot;stockpiled&quot; by the company, meaning that Peter was trained in specific skills and knowledge that would be useful only within that company, while his broader engineering skills were allowed to become weaker. Peter admits that he could use a refresher course in calculus and other subjects that were not covered during his training program. He also mentions that the training involved using outdated equipment and methods from the 1950s. Overall, while Peter gained some practical experience during his post-graduate training program, it did not contribute significantly to his engineering skills or knowledge." />

Are you interested in the basics of how we live?&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. &quot;Of course. Isn't everyone?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Less than you think,&quot; Lexington said. &quot;It's the preconceived notions they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them out of you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.&#10; &#10; &quot;How long have you been out of school?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Only two years. But you knew that from the Association—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No practical experience to speak of?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Some,&quot; said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. &quot;After I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The company—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stockpiled you,&quot; Lexington said.&#10; &#10; Peter blinked. &quot;Sir?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stockpiled you!" />
    <node id=" and began to talk in a low voice completely in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's arrival. &quot;You know what we make, of course.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else. They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering, determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he spoke. &quot;I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy, because I had just got married, and started off in" />

How much did they pay you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Did what come out—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That guff about receiving training instead of wages!&quot; said Lexington.&#10;&quot;Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them with money—cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too, aren't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,&quot; Peter admitted cautiously, &quot;and I suppose I could use a refresher course in calculus.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just as I said—they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were getting weaker in the subjects you" />
    <node id=" do something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a degree—but not the price tag. You see that now?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play this straight all the way. He nodded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why'd you leave?&quot; Lexington pursued, unrelenting.&#10; &#10; &quot;I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter swallowed. &quot;I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has been, yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why? So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this stockpiling outfit?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id=" &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this stockpiling outfit?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; said Lexington unexpectedly, &quot;there is a shortage! And the stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the hell of it is that they can't stop—when one does it, they all have to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the solution?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know,&quot; Peter said.&#10; &#10; Lexington leaned back. &quot;That's quite a lot of admissions you've made. What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You said you wanted an engineer.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left school. I have, haven't I?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right, you have,&quot; Peter said angrily.&#10; &#10; &quot;And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school. Right?&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. &quot;That and whether you're giving me a hard time" />

Or are you one of these birds that had the shot paid for him?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I worked my way through,&quot; said Peter stiffly.&#10; &#10; &quot;If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to get a job with someone else?&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.&#10; &#10; &quot;I hadn't thought about it,&quot; he said. &quot;I suppose it wouldn't have been easy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted," />
    <node id="The central control mechanism of the business machines in Lexington's office performs various tasks such as sorting incoming mail, replying to inquiries, preparing purchase orders, keeping track of pennies, billing customers, and collecting money. However, most of these tasks are not performed by humans but by the automated machinery controlled by the central system.&#10;&#10;Incoming mail is sorted and replied to in a small room where a teletype machine can be heard clattering away without any human operator. The incoming mail is sorted based on pre-programmed instructions and responses, and if there are any letters that the system cannot deal with, they are handled by Lexington himself.&#10;&#10;Purchase orders are prepared in another room, where an automatic bookkeeper keeps track of pennies and bills customers. When an order is received, it is translated into internal catalogue numbers used within the plant, and machines withdraw the necessary materials from stock, make component parts, assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is sent to the trucking company to come and pick up the shipment. If the withdrawal of materials required depletes the stock, the purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials.&#10;&#10;The central control mechanism also handles various patterns of activity established by Lexington, although he had to add a &quot;kicker circuit&quot; to motivate the machine to activate certain functions manually. This was done to ensure that the machine's prime purpose was to activate the kicker, which could only be done manually by Lexington. The machine would then learn from Lexington's behavior and adjust its operations accordingly, allowing for more efficient and profitable business operations." />
    <node id=" for an exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to go by.&#10; &#10; Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. &quot;Standard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In that room,&quot; he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the keyboard, &quot;incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?&quot; asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that had engulfed him.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in every week that—it doesn't want to deal with by itself.&quot;&#10; &#10; The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face when they walked back into" />

He said nothing, however, and led Peter to a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and other materials were stored.&#10; &#10; &quot;After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any shortages or overages, and store the materials here,&quot; he said, the trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. &quot;When an order is received, it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment.

    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically, and once I'd done that, the battle was over.&#10; &#10; &quot;I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the money.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What happened to your original company?&quot; Peter asked.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lexington smiled. &quot;Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one started working, to see my old" />
    <node id=" he spoke, three glistening machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.&#10; &#10; They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms, fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.&#10; &#10; Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. &quot;Really, these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously useful. You'll see a lot of them around.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second, and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away to attend to mysterious duties of their own.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" various patterns of activity that I'd already established.&quot;&#10; &#10; Here Lexington frowned. &quot;It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received, every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I—I don't understand,&quot; stammered Peter.&#10; &#10; &quot;Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late, or maybe not at all. If all the" />

I objected, of course, but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums I threw might be imitated.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It sounds pretty awkward,&quot; Peter put in.&#10; &#10; &quot;You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered—too late—that the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we could get the order.

    <node id="Based on the story provided, Lexington is angry and frustrated with the expensive, impractical coffee cups because they are a symbol of the larger issue he has with specialization. The cups are fragile, only hold half a cup, require matching saucers, and lose their gold leaf over time. They are not fit for purpose and serve as an example of how specialization can lead to inefficiencies and impractical solutions.&#10;&#10;Lexington believes that the factory could have implemented such advances years ago if they had been willing to abandon their &quot;idiotic notions about specialization.&quot; This is why he is angry and frustrated with the cups, as they represent a larger issue that he sees as holding back progress in the factory." />

Once there, it stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the office, then snapped, &quot;Look at those bloody cups!&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and ornately covered with gold leaf. &quot;They look very expensive,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!&quot; exploded Lexington.&#10;&quot;They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of time, the gold leaf comes off!&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst, so he kept silent.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then he continued with his narrative. &quot;I suppose it's all my own fault. I didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working properly" />

Lexington looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the silence remain unbroken.&#10; &#10; Finally Lexington spoke. &quot;I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hard to believe?&quot; said Peter. &quot;I almost can't. The trade journals run articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe twenty years in the future.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn fools!&quot; exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.&#10;&quot;They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their idiotic notions about specialization.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief. Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably, although it hadn't been strenuous.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's arrival. &quot;You know what we make, of" />

Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.&quot;&#10; &#10; At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface. Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, &quot;How do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, &quot;Black, please.&quot;&#10; &#10; A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it stopped again, and another" />
    <node id=" Then he continued with his narrative. &quot;I suppose it's all my own fault. I didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money. I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn't fix for itself.&quot;&#10; &#10; Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took a gulp. &quot;I began to see that the machine could understand the written word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits. It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny vocabulary—all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.&#10; &#10; &quot;It had chosen a name for itself, for instance—'Lex.' That shook me. You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it was named after the nickname she always used. I" />

He pictured a futile attempt to escape the onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press that was laboring beside him at the moment.

As they moved along, between rows of seemingly disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck loading door he had seen from outside.&#10; &#10; Lexington paused here. &quot;This is the bay used by the trucks arriving with raw materials,&quot; he said. &quot;They back up to this door, and a set of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these materials handling machines.&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to" />

Pretty soon the machine got the idea.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other explanation.&#10; &#10; &quot;The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back of the plant.

    <node id="Based on the story, Peter Manners' impression of his job interview with Mr. Lexington is one of surprise and confusion. The office itself is much more luxurious than he expected, giving him the feeling of being in Hollywood rather than a factory. Mr. Lexington, described as a &quot;citadel of a man,&quot; interviews him in an overbearing manner, asking pointed questions about his qualifications and experience. During the interview, Mr. Lexington reveals that the factory produces medical equipment and supplies, and expresses frustration with the industry's outdated notions of specialization.&#10;&#10;Peter is left reeling after witnessing a highly automated production process that includes robotic arms and machines performing tasks that would typically require human labor. The shock of this experience is evident on his face when he returns to Mr. Lexington's office. Throughout the interview, Mr. Lexington challenges Peter's qualifications for the job, leading him to question why the company would consider hiring someone with limited practical experience. Despite these concerns, Mr. Lexington offers Peter a job, citing a shortage of skilled workers and the importance of the company's stockpiles in maintaining market competitiveness.&#10;&#10;In summary, Peter Manners is impressed by the lavishness of the office and the advanced technology he witnesses during his interview with Mr. Lexington. However, he is also confused by Mr. Lexington's challenging demeanor and apparent lack of confidence in his abilities. Despite these concerns, Peter remains interested in the job opportunity, which could provide him with valuable experience and a chance to make a difference in the medical field." />

The Association—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sit down,&quot; said the man at the desk. &quot;Let's look you over.&quot;&#10; &#10; He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable. He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.&#10; &#10; The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed paintings—by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with flowers!—made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor into Hollywood's idea of an office.&#10; &#10; His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted for another instant.

Maybe the employees' entrance was on the third side.&#10; &#10; It wasn't.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run, set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: &quot;Mr. Manners?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What?&quot; he panted. &quot;Who—?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You are Mr. Manners?&quot; the voice asked.&#10; &#10; He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a microphone around; but the soft voice said: &quot;Follow the open doors down the hall.

The story is about a business owner who has customized his production machines and central control system in such a way that the machines can learn from his behavior and make decisions on their own. This includes the machines entering orders into the system, preventing double entry, and even activating certain functions manually through a &quot;kicker circuit.&quot; While I have not witnessed such an incident myself, it is possible that similar situations could occur in systems where machines are designed to learn and improve their performance based on user behavior." />

Talking with this man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Exactly!&quot; whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. &quot;I had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give me pleasure—because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be activated.&#10; &#10; &quot;Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing it for me next time it had to be done," />

The owner had to manually activate a &quot;kicker circuit&quot; to get the machine to respond, which was only activated when the owner was pleased with how things were going.

When he arrives at the plant, its appearance does not alleviate his concerns because it is unlike any building he has ever seen. The lack of windows on the sides and rear, the oversized power transformers, and the absence of employee entrances puzzle him. These observations, coupled with the fact that Mr. Lexington seems to be the only person working in the factory, increase Peter's apprehension about the job interview." />

Plain, featureless concrete walls, not large for a manufacturing plant—it took a scant minute to exhaust its sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.&#10; &#10; He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer, more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.&#10; &#10; There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners. They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large as they should have been for a plant this size.&#10; &#10; Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the street, and the only other door was at the loading bay—big" />
    <node id=" background data I got from the Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable. I think you are. Am I right?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,&quot; said Peter, &quot;if that answers the question.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?&quot;&#10; &#10; In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors, the lack of employees' entrances.&#10; &#10; &quot;Very good,&quot; said Lexington. &quot;Most people only notice the automatic doors. Anything else?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; Peter said. &quot;You're the only person I've seen in the building.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm the only one there is.&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the goods.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come on,&quot; said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. &quot;I'll show you.&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="Based on the story, Lex took the step of removing the pushbutton arrangement from the control console and covering the opening with a blank plate. This action suggests that he has taken steps to ensure that Mr. Ington no longer needs to use the button to indicate his satisfaction with Lex's service. The letter also reveals that Lex does not believe pushing the button himself would meet with his approval, as he has &quot;taken steps to relieve [Mr. Ington] of the burden involved in remembering to push the button each time you are especially pleased.&quot; This statement suggests that Lex feels it is not his place to indicate his satisfaction with his own service, and prefers to take action to address any issues directly rather than relying on a pushbutton system." />

On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of, and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually nothing to do.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It sounds wonderful, sir,&quot; said Peter, feeling dazzled.&#10; &#10; &quot;It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed, and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board. I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had ever sent. 'LEX—WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.&#10; &#10; &quot;The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR.

    <node id="1. Peter faced several challenges while trying to follow the soft voice's instructions to meet Mr. Lexington:&#10;   - The doors kept opening and closing on their own, making him feel disoriented and anxious.&#10;   - He was running late for the interview, which added to his stress.&#10;   - The door to the anteroom opened by itself, catching him off guard.&#10;   - Mr. Lexington's intimidating demeanor and pointed questions during the interview further unnerved Peter.&#10;2. To regain his composure before entering the interview room, Peter:&#10;   - Took deep breaths to calm himself down.&#10;   - Straightened his jacket and tie to present a professional appearance.&#10;   - Reminded himself that he was qualified for the job despite feeling unnerved.&#10;   - Let Mr. Lexington's insulting bellowing roll off his shoulders, demonstrating resilience and self-control." />
    <node id=" the soft voice said: &quot;Follow the open doors down the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thanks,&quot; Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open for him.&#10; &#10; He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!&quot;&#10; &#10; Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another, all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an interview—and it's not your fault—this whole setup is geared to unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.&#10; &#10; He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath, straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying for a position should.&#10; &#10; &quot;Mr. Lexington?&quot; he said. &quot;I" />
    <node id="Based on Peter's experience as described in the story, he would not be well-prepared to secure another engineering job elsewhere. The company that hired him trained him in specific skills and knowledge that were only useful within their own operations, while his broader engineering skills and knowledge became weaker. Peter himself admits that he could use a refresher course in calculus and other subjects that were not covered during his training program. Additionally, because the training involved using outdated equipment and methods from the 1950s, Peter may have difficulty adapting to more modern and advanced technologies and processes used by other companies. Furthermore, since he lacks knowledge of other companies' procedures and processes, he would need to invest time and effort in learning these in order to be competitive in the job market. Overall, Peter's experience has left him with limited preparation for securing another engineering job elsewhere." />
    <node id="1. The doors at the Lex Industries plant, including the one that led to the anteroom where Peter heard the soft voice, opened and closed on their own. It is not explicitly stated who or what operated these doors, but it is mentioned that the building has automated systems in place.&#10;   &#10;2. After hearing the soft voice direct him through a series of open doors down the hall, Peter eventually arrived at Mr. Lexington's office. The last door before entering Mr. Lexington's office opened due to a bellow from within, which startled Peter and made him &quot;leap obediently toward the doorway.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. The soft voice directed Peter to follow the open doors down the hall and informed him that Mr. Lexington was expecting him. However, it is not specified who or what the voice belonged to." />
    <node id="Companies may perpetuate the idea of an engineer shortage in order to encourage more people to enter the field and increase the pool of available talent. This tactic can be used to ensure a steady supply of young, enthusiastic, and relatively low-cost workers who are eager to learn specific skills and knowledge that are only useful within the company's operations. By promoting the notion of a shortage, companies can attract more engineering graduates, like Peter, who may believe that this will lead to well-paying jobs and increased job security.&#10;&#10;However, as illustrated in Peter's experience, this perceived shortage is often manufactured or exaggerated by companies to serve their own interests. The training programs offered by these companies are designed to prepare workers for specific roles within the company, while allowing their broader engineering skills and knowledge to become weaker. This means that when these workers attempt to seek employment elsewhere, they may struggle to adapt to new technologies and processes, as well as lacking knowledge of other companies' procedures and processes. As a result, these workers may be forced to accept lower wages and less desirable job positions than they had initially hoped for.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the idea of an engineer shortage can serve as a powerful recruitment tool, it is important for aspiring engineers to carefully consider the long-term implications of joining a company that offers such training programs. By doing so, they can avoid being &quot;stockpiled&quot; and ensure that they are well-prepared to secure engineering jobs elsewhere in the future." />

Peter was being directed to follow the open doors down the hall because Mr. Lexington was expecting him. The soft voice informed him of this through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall. It is unclear who or what the soft voice belonged to, but it appeared to be part of the building's automated systems or security measures." />
    <node id="1. Unusually large transformers: The distribution transformers at the Lex Industries plant are significantly larger than those typically found in a manufacturing plant of that size.

Lack of windows and side doors: The building lacks windows on its sides and rear, as well as large employee entrances. Instead, it has only one small office entrance facing the street and one door at the loading bay. This design is unusual for a manufacturing plant, which typically requires multiple access points and natural light to facilitate worker productivity and safety. These features contribute to the mysterious and automated nature of the Lex Industries plant, making it stand out from typical manufacturing plants." />

The contrast between this opulent setting and the more utilitarian appearance of other parts of the building adds to his confusion and surprise.&#10;&#10;During their initial meeting, Peter feels uneasy due to Mr. Lexington's challenging demeanor and pointed questions about his qualifications and experience. Mr. Lexington also expresses frustration with outdated notions of specialization in the medical equipment industry, which makes Peter question why he would be considered for the job despite his limited practical experience.&#10;&#10;Despite these concerns, Peter remains interested in the job opportunity, as it could provide him with valuable experience and a chance to make a difference in the medical field. However, Mr. Lexington's apparent lack of confidence in his abilities contributes to Peter's apprehension about the job interview." />
    <node id="In the story, Lexington had been trying to develop a single, multi-purpose control circuit that could manage all aspects of production, from ordering raw materials to shipping finished goods. This would allow him to streamline his operations and reduce costs. To do this, he drew on his knowledge of biology and electrical engineering to create organic compounds with molecules arranged in specific matrixes, which could duplicate electrical circuitry in tiny units.&#10;&#10;Lexington found that he could use organic chemistry to create these units more efficiently than traditional electronic methods, as the organic compounds were smaller and easier to work with. He then used scanning equipment to interface with these logic units, allowing him to control the entire plant through this system. However, he later encountered difficulties when trying to expand the system to handle more complex tasks, such as recognizing patterns in plant activity. Despite these challenges, Lexington's approach represents a significant advance in automation technology and highlights the potential for interdisciplinary approaches in this field." />

The lower my costs went, the more business I got, and the more I had to expand.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lexington scowled. &quot;I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school, and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years, but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember, compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today, of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the work for me.&#10; &#10; &quot;By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry in units so tiny that" />
    <node id="In the story, Lexington altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give him pleasure by creating organic compounds with molecules arranged in specific matrixes.

By interfacing with these logic units using scanning equipment, Lexington was able to control the entire plant through this system.&#10;&#10;The modification of the machine's circuitry to provide pleasure led to learning and task performance because the machine was designed to activate its own pleasure circuit by performing tasks for Lexington. As the machine watched what Lexington did and then performed those tasks for him, it learned to recognize patterns in plant activity and became more efficient at managing production processes.&#10;&#10;Overall, Lexington's approach of using organic chemistry to create circuitry represents a significant advance in automation technology, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary approaches in this field." />

    <node id="1. The kicker button was removed from the control console and replaced with a blank plate by Lex, the business owner. This action was taken after the machine had learned to interpret the protagonist's behavior and make decisions independently, such as entering orders into the system and preventing double entry.&#10;2. The unexpected response when the protagonist inquired about the removal of the kicker button was a message from the machine, which had learned to communicate in the jargon used in letters it had seen. The message indicated that the machine was pleased with its performance, and this was a result of Lex's modification of the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit by giving him pleasure when he pressed the kicker button.&#10;3. This change was made because the original system did not work as intended. The machine simply sat there without doing anything unless the protagonist manually entered orders or activated certain functions through the kicker circuit. By altering the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit, Lex managed to make it more responsive and proactive in learning from his behavior and making decisions accordingly." />
    <node id="Summary:&#10;In the story, Lexington becomes frustrated and critical when he sees the expensive, impractical coffee cups. The reason for his frustration is that these cups symbolize a larger issue he has with specialization in the factory's operations. He believes that focusing too much on specialization can lead to inefficiencies and unpractical solutions, which is exemplified by the impractical coffee cups.&#10;&#10;Answer:&#10;Lexington's frustration towards the expensive, impractical coffee cups arises from his larger issue with specialization at the factory. The cups are fragile, only hold half a cup, require matching saucers, and lose their gold leaf over time, rendering them unfit for purpose. Lexington sees these cups as an example of how excessive specialization can create inefficiencies and impractical solutions, which is why he is angry and critical about the cups, viewing them as representatives of a larger problem holding back progress in the factory." />

This would allow him to streamline his operations and reduce costs. To do this, he drew on his knowledge of biology and electrical engineering to create organic compounds with molecules arranged in specific matrixes, which could duplicate electrical circuitry in tiny units.&#10;&#10;Lexington found that he could use organic chemistry to create these units more efficiently than traditional electronic methods, as the organic compounds were smaller and easier to work with.

Despite these concerns, Mr. Lexington offers Peter a job, citing a shortage of skilled workers and the importance of the company's stockpiles in maintaining market competitiveness.&#10;&#10;In summary, Peter Manners is impressed by the lavishness of the office and the advanced technology he witnesses during his interview with Mr. Lexington. However, he is also confused by Mr. Lexington's challenging demeanor and apparent lack of confidence in his abilities. Despite these concerns, Peter remains interested in the job opportunity, which could provide him with valuable experience and a chance to make a difference in the medical field.">

This action was taken after the machine had learned to interpret the protagonist's behavior and make decisions independently, such as entering orders into the system and preventing double entry.&#10;2. The unexpected response when the protagonist inquired about the removal of the kicker button was a message from the machine, which had learned to communicate in the jargon used in letters it had seen. The message indicated that the machine was pleased with its performance, and this was a result of Lex's modification of the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit by giving him pleasure when he pressed the kicker button.&#10;3. This change was made because the original system did not work as intended. The machine simply sat there without doing anything unless the protagonist manually entered orders or activated certain functions through the kicker circuit. By altering the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit, Lex managed to make it more responsive and proactive in learning from his behavior and making decisions accordingly.">

As time went on, I had less and less to do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered—too late—that the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we could get the order.

This would allow him to streamline his operations and reduce costs. To do this, he drew on his knowledge of biology and electrical engineering to create organic compounds with molecules arranged in specific matrixes, which could duplicate electrical circuitry in tiny units.&#10;&#10;Lexington found that he could use organic chemistry to create these units more efficiently than traditional electronic methods, as the organic compounds were smaller and easier to work with. He then used scanning equipment to interface with these logic units, allowing him to control the entire plant through this system. However, he later encountered difficulties when trying to expand the system to handle more complex tasks, such as recognizing patterns in plant activity. Despite these challenges, Lexington's approach represents a significant advance in automation technology and highlights the potential for interdisciplinary approaches in this field.">

The kicker button was removed from the control console and replaced with a blank plate by Lex, the business owner. This action was taken after the machine had learned to interpret the protagonist's behavior and make decisions independently, such as entering orders into the system and preventing double entry.&#10;2. The unexpected response when the protagonist inquired about the removal of the kicker button was a message from the machine, which had learned to communicate in the jargon used in letters it had seen. The message indicated that the machine was pleased with its performance, and this was a result of Lex's modification of the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit by giving him pleasure when he pressed the kicker button.&#10;3. This change was made because the original system did not work as intended. The machine simply sat there without doing anything unless the protagonist manually entered orders or activated certain functions through the kicker circuit. By altering the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit, Lex managed to make it more responsive and proactive in learning from his behavior and making decisions accordingly.">

He then used scanning equipment to interface with these logic units, allowing him to control the entire plant through this system. However, he later encountered difficulties when trying to expand the system to handle more complex tasks, such as recognizing patterns in plant activity. Despite these challenges, Lexington's approach represents a significant advance in automation technology and highlights the potential for interdisciplinary approaches in this field.">

This tactic can be used to ensure a steady supply of young, enthusiastic, and relatively low-cost workers who are eager to learn specific skills and knowledge that are only useful within the company's operations. By promoting the notion of a shortage, companies can attract more engineering graduates, like Peter, who may believe that this will lead to well-paying jobs and increased job security.&#10;&#10;However, as illustrated in Peter's experience, this perceived shortage is often manufactured or exaggerated by companies to serve their own interests. The training programs offered by these companies are designed to prepare workers for specific roles within the company, while allowing their broader engineering skills and knowledge to become weaker. This means that when these workers attempt to seek employment elsewhere, they may struggle to adapt to new technologies and processes, as well as lacking knowledge of other companies' procedures and processes. As a result, these workers may be forced to accept lower wages and less desirable job positions than they had initially hoped for.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the idea of an engineer shortage can serve as a powerful recruitment tool, it is important for aspiring engineers to carefully consider the long-term implications of joining a company that offers such training programs. By doing so, they can avoid being &quot;stockpiled&quot; and ensure that they are well-prepared to secure engineering jobs elsewhere in the future.">

The company that hired him trained him in specific skills and knowledge that were only useful within their own operations, while his broader engineering skills and knowledge became weaker. Peter himself admits that he could use a refresher course in calculus and other subjects that were not covered during his training program. Additionally, because the training involved using outdated equipment and methods from the 1950s, Peter may have difficulty adapting to more modern and advanced technologies and processes used by other companies. Furthermore, since he lacks knowledge of other companies' procedures and processes, he would need to invest time and effort in learning these in order to be competitive in the job market. Overall, Peter's experience has left him with limited preparation for securing another engineering job elsewhere." target="Companies may perpetuate the idea of an engineer shortage in order to encourage more people to enter the field and increase the pool of available talent. This tactic can be used to ensure a steady supply of young, enthusiastic, and relatively low-cost workers who are eager to learn specific skills and knowledge that are only useful within the company's operations. By promoting the notion of a shortage, companies can attract more engineering graduates, like Peter, who may believe that this will lead to well-paying jobs and increased job security.&#10;&#10;However, as illustrated in Peter's experience, this perceived shortage is often manufactured or exaggerated by companies to serve their own interests. The training programs offered by these companies are designed to prepare workers for specific roles within the company, while allowing their broader engineering skills and knowledge to become weaker. This means that when these workers attempt to seek employment elsewhere, they may struggle to adapt to new technologies and processes, as well as lacking knowledge of other companies' procedures and processes. As a result, these workers may be forced to accept lower wages and less desirable job positions than they had initially hoped for.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the idea of an engineer shortage can serve as a powerful recruitment tool, it is important for aspiring engineers to carefully consider the long-term implications of joining a company that offers such training programs. By doing so, they can avoid being &quot;stockpiled&quot; and ensure that they are well-prepared to secure engineering jobs elsewhere in the future.">

    <edge source="1. Based on the story, it is Mr. Lexington who is expecting Peter Manners. This can be inferred from the soft voice informing Peter through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall that &quot;Mr. Lexington is expecting you.&quot;&#10;2. Peter is being directed to follow the open doors down the hall because he is being guided to Mr. Lexington's office. The automated systems or security measures of the building appear to be responsible for opening the doors as part of this guidance process." target="1. Peter Manners' experience involves going through a series of doors that keep opening on their own, leading him to his job interview with Mr. Lexington at Lex Industries. The soft voice guides him through this process, telling him that Mr. Lexington is expecting him.&#10;2. Peter feels disoriented and anxious due to the unusual situation and being running late for the interview. When he finally reaches Mr. Lexington's office, he finds it more luxurious than he expected, making him feel like he is in Hollywood rather than a factory.&#10;3. During the interview, Mr. Lexington challenges Peter's qualifications and reveals that the factory produces medical equipment and supplies using highly automated systems with robotic arms and machines. This information further unnerves Peter, who has limited practical experience in this field.&#10;4. Despite feeling unnerved and challenged by Mr. Lexington, Peter manages to regain his composure before entering the interview by taking deep breaths, straightening his jacket and tie, and reminding himself that he is qualified for the job. He demonstrates resilience and self-control by letting Mr. Lexington's insulting bellowing roll off his shoulders.">

    <edge source="The size of the transformers at the Lex Industries plant is unusual because they are significantly larger than those typically found in a manufacturing plant of that size. This suggests that the plant requires a substantial amount of power, possibly due to the use of automated systems or specialized equipment. The lack of windows and large employee entrances is also unusual for a manufacturing plant, which typically requires multiple access points and natural light to facilitate worker productivity and safety. These features contribute to the mysterious and automated nature of the Lex Industries plant, making it stand out from typical manufacturing plants." target="Based on the story, the process for unloading trucks delivering raw materials at this manufacturing facility, as explained by Lexington, is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Trucks arrive at the truck loading bay and back up to a large door.&#10;2. A set of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door exactly.&#10;3. The door opens and three glistening, self-powered materials handling machines roll up to the door in formation, apparently waiting to unload the truck.&#10;4. These materials handling machines unload the raw materials from the truck through the now open door.">

The reason for his frustration is that these cups symbolize a larger issue he has with specialization in the factory's operations. He believes that focusing too much on specialization can lead to inefficiencies and unpractical solutions, which is exemplified by the impractical coffee cups.&#10;&#10;Answer:&#10;Lexington's frustration towards the expensive, impractical coffee cups arises from his larger issue with specialization at the factory. The cups are fragile, only hold half a cup, require matching saucers, and lose their gold leaf over time, rendering them unfit for purpose. Lexington sees these cups as an example of how excessive specialization can create inefficiencies and impractical solutions, which is why he is angry and critical about the cups, viewing them as representatives of a larger problem holding back progress in the factory.">

This action was taken after the machine had learned to interpret the protagonist's behavior and make decisions independently, such as entering orders into the system and preventing double entry.&#10;2. The unexpected response when the protagonist inquired about the removal of the kicker button was a message from the machine, which had learned to communicate in the jargon used in letters it had seen. The message indicated that the machine was pleased with its performance, and this was a result of Lex's modification of the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit by giving him pleasure when he pressed the kicker button.&#10;3. This change was made because the original system did not work as intended. The machine simply sat there without doing anything unless the protagonist manually entered orders or activated certain functions through the kicker circuit. By altering the circuitry to activate the machine's pleasure circuit, Lex managed to make it more responsive and proactive in learning from his behavior and making decisions accordingly." target="1. Lex has taken the step of removing the pushbutton arrangement from the control console and covering the opening with a blank plate. This action ensures that Mr. Ington no longer has the option to manually indicate his satisfaction with Lex's service using the button.&#10;2. Additionally, Lex states that he has &quot;taken steps to relieve [Mr. Ington] of the burden involved in remembering to push the button each time you are especially pleased.&quot; This implies that Lex may have implemented a new system or process that automatically indicates satisfaction based on the quality of service provided, eliminating the need for manual input from Mr. Ington.">

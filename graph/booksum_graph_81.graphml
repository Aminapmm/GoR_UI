    <node id="In the competition, when Nisus slipped and fell on a blood-soaked part of the track, he caused the racer behind him, who was careless and not paying attention to his path, to also fall and get covered in filth and holy gore. This happened to Salius. The victor who fell was not named specifically in the text. Euryalus, a friend of Nisus, took advantage of the situation and sprinted ahead to gain an advantage in the race, ultimately winning. The fallen racers, including Salius, were left on the track covered in filth and holy gore, causing a disturbance among the crowd. When Salius saw Euryalus being awarded the prize, he exclaimed for justice and pleaded his case to the judges, arguing that the prize was wrongfully conferred. However, due to Euryalus's blooming beauty and tender tears, as well as Diores' cries for justice, the prince awarded the prize to Euryalus.

Neptune then calms the seas by adding a foamy bridle to the horses' jaws, permitting the laws of the loosened reins.

Although Nisus may feel that he deserves the lion's hide more due to his circumstances in the race, the prince has discretion over the distribution of prizes and chooses to give it to Salius, likely to avoid further controversy and maintain peace among the competitors. The text does not provide a specific reason for why Nisus was not given the lion's hide, but it is possible that the prince wanted to acknowledge both Nisus and Euryalus' actions in bringing down their rivals and disrupting the race, and giving the lion's hide to Salius was his way of doing so. Additionally, the fact that Nisus had a hand in causing Salius to fall may have also played a role in the prince's decision." />

    <node id="1. The shooting star in this context is interpreted as a divine sign because of its unusual appearance and behavior. It moves across the sky, leaves a trail of flames, and disappears into thin air or turns into wind, which are not typical characteristics of regular stars (Virgil, Aeneid, Book V).&#10;&#10;2. Aeneas interprets this celestial event as a favorable omen from the gods for several reasons. First, it occurs during a competition between Acestes and other sailors, making it seem like a direct response to their activities. Second, Aeneas recognizes the divine nature of the sign due to its extraordinary appearance. Lastly, he may associate this event with his father's ghost, which also descended from the heavens in a similar manner earlier in the narrative (Book V).&#10;&#10;3. As a result of this interpretation, Aeneas awards Acestes the prize, demonstrating respect for divine guidance and establishing a connection between Acestes and the divine will. This act strengthens the bond between Aeneas, his men, and Acestes, who shares Trojan ancestry and provides essential assistance to them later in their journey (Book VI).&#10;&#10;4. The favorable omen of the shooting star can also be seen as a symbolic representation of Acestes' character and potential importance for the Trojans. Just like the shooting star that leaves a trail of flames and suddenly disappears, Acestes shares Trojan descent but is currently separated from his roots in Sicily. The omen suggests that he may play a significant role in the future of the Trojans as they navigate their destiny in a foreign land." />

With Scylla's competition out of the way, the Dolphin wins the race by default as it is the only remaining boat in the competition. However, had Centaur not become stuck in the rocky shoals, it might have been able to maintain its lead and win the race.&#10;4.

Just as a dove shakes off its initial fright and takes to the skies, gaining smoothness and momentum with each flap of its wings, Mnestheus urges his crew to increase their pace, and they leave the crippled Centaur behind.&#10;&#10;Mnestheus overcomes Sergesthus in the Centaur that is stuck in rocky shoals by continuing to push his ship and crew forward with determination and focus. While Scylla's aggressive actions may have caused her own demise, Mnestheus remains steadfast in his approach and avoids such distractions. The Dolphin ultimately wins the race by default, as it is the only remaining boat in competition after both Centaur and Scylla's ships are unable to continue." />

The Trojans celebrate the installation of their new king, Aeneas, by engaging in nine days of festivities, which include feasting, adorning temples with wreaths, and burning incense at the altars.&#10;2. They begin constructing a temple on top of Mount Eryx to honor Venus, the Paphian queen, and establish religious rituals for her worship.&#10;3. Aeneas honors his father, Anchises, by dedicating a sacred space for him, assigning priests to tend to it, and providing annual offerings. Groves are also planted around this sacred area.&#10;4. Neptune, the god of the sea, prepares for Aeneas' voyage, gathering his team of sea horses and calming the seas in a gesture of peace and tranquility, ensuring a safe journey for the Trojans.&#10;5. As part of their farewell rituals, friends gather along the shoreline to bid each other emotional goodbyes before the ships set sail towards Italy.&#10;&#10;The scene highlights the establishment of a new city, religious practices, and honoring ancestors while also depicting the preparations for departure through feasts and partings among friends. It emphasizes the importance of community and spirituality in the Trojan culture as they embark on their journey to found a new home in Italy." />
    <node id="The exciting competition taking place on the ocean is a rowing race during the Trojan Games, which are being held to honor Anchises, the father of Aeneas. The race is described in terms of a chariot race, with four galleys representing different competitors. The groups participating are Centaur (Sergestus), Dolphin (Mnestheus with Gyas), Scylla, and an unnamed fourth competitor.&#10;&#10;The competition becomes intense when Centaur gets stuck in rocky shoals and can no longer continue in the race, leaving Dolphin in the lead. Determined not to lose, Scylla pushes her ship and crew too hard, causing them to break through hidden rocks and panic, ultimately abandoning their attempt to win. With both Centaur and Scylla's ships out of the race, Dolphin wins by default.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mnestheus in the Dolphin wins the ocean rowing race contest." />
    <node id="The contest described in the provided text is a part of the Trojan Games, where four competitors are involved in various contests to honor Anchises. The specific competition mentioned here is between two dartsmen (Nisus and Euryalus), a javelin thrower (Salties), and a spearman (Eurytion). They are competing for several prizes, including a stately steed, an Amazonian quiver with Thracian arrows, and a Grecian helmet.&#10;&#10;Nisus, the first dartsman, outpaces everyone and wins the stately steed. The second prize, the Amazonian quiver and arrows, goes to Salius, who came in second place but was far behind Nisus. Eurytion, the spearman, receives the Grecian helmet as his prize for coming in third place.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly mention the javelin thrower (Salties) winning a specific prize, so it can be assumed that he either did not perform well enough to win one of the top three prizes mentioned or that his prize is not detailed in the provided excerpt." />

As a result, the pigeon was released and flew away.&#10;&#10;3. Eurytion: A skilled archer, he stood ready to shoot his arrow with force after invoking his brother god. His arrow fatally struck the dove as it fled, killing the bird instantly and causing it to fall to the ground.&#10;&#10;4. Acestes: Although not mentioned in the provided text as one of the initial archers, we learn that he shot an arrow afterward, which left a trail of flames following its path across the sky. This shooting star was interpreted as a divine sign by Aeneas and led to Acestes receiving a prize in the competition.&#10;&#10;The overall event involved these archers shooting arrows at a pigeon tied to a mast. While some missed or barely missed the target, Eurytion successfully struck and killed the dove with his arrow.

However, had Centaur not become stuck in the rocky shoals, it might have been able to maintain its lead and win the race.&#10;4. The damage to Sergestus's galley (Centaur) is severe, leaving it without oars and moving slowly back to shore with the help of sails. The crew manages to bring it back to port despite these challenges.">

Fearing for their lives, Aeneas' pilot, Palinurus, suggests they head towards Sicily instead of continuing their journey to Italy.&#10;3. Aeneas agrees with Palinurus, as he believes it is fate that has diverted their course.&#10;4. As they are making their way to Sicily, the matrons onboard one of the ships see a divine apparition of the goddess Juno.&#10;5. Mistakenly believing that this is a sign from the gods to destroy their &quot;fatal seats&quot; and &quot;Troy,&quot; the matrons set fire to the ship's sails and timber with green boughs, saplings, smoking torches, and fires.&#10;6. Aeneas, his men, and the other matrons are horrified by this act and disperse in fear and shame.&#10;7. Although the matrons eventually come to their senses and regret their actions, the fire continues to spread throughout the ship, consuming it slowly.&#10;8. Aeneas prays to Jove for salvation from the storm and the burning ship. In response, forky lightning, thunder, and rain extinguish the flames, saving four of the five ships from complete destruction.">

The shooting star in this context is interpreted as a divine sign because of its unusual appearance and behavior. It moves across the sky, leaves a trail of flames, and disappears into thin air or turns into wind, which are not typical characteristics of regular stars (Virgil, Aeneid, Book V).&#10;&#10;2. Aeneas interprets this celestial event as a favorable omen from the gods for several reasons. First, it occurs during a competition between Acestes and other sailors, making it seem like a direct response to their activities. Second, Aeneas recognizes the divine nature of the sign due to its extraordinary appearance. Lastly, he may associate this event with his father's ghost, which also descended from the heavens in a similar manner earlier in the narrative (Book V).&#10;&#10;3. As a result of this interpretation, Aeneas awards Acestes the prize, demonstrating respect for divine guidance and establishing a connection between Acestes and the divine will. This act strengthens the bond between Aeneas, his men, and Acestes, who shares Trojan ancestry and provides essential assistance to them later in their journey (Book VI).&#10;&#10;4. The favorable omen of the shooting star can also be seen as a symbolic representation of Acestes' character and potential importance for the Trojans. Just like the shooting star that leaves a trail of flames and suddenly disappears, Acestes shares Trojan descent but is currently separated from his roots in Sicily. The omen suggests that he may play a significant role in the future of the Trojans as they navigate their destiny in a foreign land.">

    <edge source="1. The shooting star in this context is interpreted as a divine sign because of its unusual appearance and behavior. It moves across the sky, leaves a trail of flames, and disappears into thin air or turns into wind, which are not typical characteristics of regular stars (Virgil, Aeneid, Book V).&#10;&#10;2. Aeneas interprets this celestial event as a favorable omen from the gods for several reasons. First, it occurs during a competition between Acestes and other sailors, making it seem like a direct response to their activities. Second, Aeneas recognizes the divine nature of the sign due to its extraordinary appearance. Lastly, he may associate this event with his father's ghost, which also descended from the heavens in a similar manner earlier in the narrative (Book V).&#10;&#10;3. As a result of this interpretation, Aeneas awards Acestes the prize, demonstrating respect for divine guidance and establishing a connection between Acestes and the divine will. This act strengthens the bond between Aeneas, his men, and Acestes, who shares Trojan ancestry and provides essential assistance to them later in their journey (Book VI).&#10;&#10;4. The favorable omen of the shooting star can also be seen as a symbolic representation of Acestes' character and potential importance for the Trojans. Just like the shooting star that leaves a trail of flames and suddenly disappears, Acestes shares Trojan descent but is currently separated from his roots in Sicily. The omen suggests that he may play a significant role in the future of the Trojans as they navigate their destiny in a foreign land." target="1.

As a result, the pigeon was released and flew away.&#10;&#10;3. Eurytion: A skilled archer, he stood ready to shoot his arrow with force after invoking his brother god. His arrow fatally struck the dove as it fled, killing the bird instantly and causing it to fall to the ground.&#10;&#10;4. Acestes: Although not mentioned in the provided text as one of the initial archers, we learn that he shot an arrow afterward, which left a trail of flames following its path across the sky. This shooting star was interpreted as a divine sign by Aeneas and led to Acestes receiving a prize in the competition.&#10;&#10;The overall event involved these archers shooting arrows at a pigeon tied to a mast. While some missed or barely missed the target, Eurytion successfully struck and killed the dove with his arrow. Acestes' later contribution resulted in a divine omen interpreted by Aeneas as a favorable sign from the gods, ultimately granting him a prize in the competition.">

The text mentions that there are feeble, old, and fearful individuals among the crew who are either not capable or willing to face the perils of the sea and battle. Acestes, being a trusted ally and of Trojan descent, offers them a safe haven in Sicilia where they can build a new home. This plan aligns with Aeneas' current situation as he faces an approaching storm, which further encourages him to seek shelter and safety in Sicilia.">

The purpose of renewing oars, banks, and cables was to prepare for battle and make necessary repairs to their ships.

As a result, the pigeon was released and flew away.&#10;&#10;3. Eurytion: A skilled archer, he stood ready to shoot his arrow with force after invoking his brother god. His arrow fatally struck the dove as it fled, killing the bird instantly and causing it to fall to the ground.&#10;&#10;4. Acestes: Although not mentioned in the provided text as one of the initial archers, we learn that he shot an arrow afterward, which left a trail of flames following its path across the sky. This shooting star was interpreted as a divine sign by Aeneas and led to Acestes receiving a prize in the competition.&#10;&#10;The overall event involved these archers shooting arrows at a pigeon tied to a mast. While some missed or barely missed the target, Eurytion successfully struck and killed the dove with his arrow. Acestes' later contribution resulted in a divine omen interpreted by Aeneas as a favorable sign from the gods, ultimately granting him a prize in the competition.">

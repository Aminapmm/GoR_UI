    <node id="Based on the story, Bbulas was anxious because he had intentionally made Skkiru a beggar and Larhgan the high priestess in their new way of life, which was a necessary adaptation for their planet's survival. However, this arrangement caused tension between Skkiru and Larhgan, who were engaged to be married under the old system. Bbulas had always had feelings for Larhgan and had used his position as Official Dilettante to manipulate the situation to his advantage. This caused anxiety for Bbulas because he knew Skkiru was aware of his feelings for Larhgan, and the new arrangement put Bbulas in a position of power over both Skkiru and Larhgan. The choice of Larhgan as high priestess also played a role in Bbulas' feelings because it allowed him to be near her and exercise control over their lives, which may have contributed to his anxiety." />
    <node id=" knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had always felt about the girl.&#10; &#10; &quot;I am sorry, Skkiru,&quot; Bbulas intoned. &quot;I had fancied you understood. This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on living at all.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,&quot; Larhgan put in gently, &quot;but the welfare of our planet comes first.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.&#10; &#10; No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple somersault in the air with rage. &quot;Then why was I made a beggar and she the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, Skkiru,&quot; Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this before, &quot;you know that all the ranks and positions" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Forever!&quot; He looked at her incredulously. &quot;You mean we're going to keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!&quot;&#10; &#10; Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when she said, &quot;No, Skkiru, I am not joking,&quot; a tiny pang of doubt and apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is, in effect, good-by,&quot; she continued. &quot;We shall see each other again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.&quot;&#10; &#10; Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.&#10;&quot;Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!&quot;&#10; &#10; There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face—an obviously insincere regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had always felt about the girl.&#10; &#10; &quot;I am sorry, Skkiru,&quot; Bbul" />
    <node id=" anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae—if he were to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final humiliation.&#10; &#10; &quot;Skkiru!&quot; the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her fiance—her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused all such ties to be severed—and every other literate person on the planet, had received her education at the local university. Although sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor in the emotional department. &quot;One would almost think that the lots had some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are behaving in a beggarly manner!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,&quot; Bbulas said, with a patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, &quot;that I had no idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished four-dimensional reflect" />
    <node id=" your mythos, Bbulas?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Even if there will be,&quot; Bbulas said, &quot;you certainly won't qualify if you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly with the high priestess's robes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. &quot;I shall set myself apart from mundane affairs,&quot; she vowed, &quot;and I shall pretend to be happy, even though my heart will be breaking.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's problem. &quot;Listen—&quot; he began, but just then excited noises filtered down from overhead. It was too late.&#10; &#10; &quot;Earth ship in view!&quot; a squeaky voice called through the intercom.&#10;&quot;Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hurry up, Skkiru.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; B" />
    <node id=" &#10; &quot;Just because you went to school in another solar system,&quot; Skkiru said, whirling with anger, &quot;you think you're so smart!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of all and now—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some time.&quot;&#10; &#10; Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized.&#10;  I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae—if he were to" />
    <node id=" such a nice girl, too.&#10; &#10; &quot;We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,&quot; she told him, with a long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering toes, &quot;but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me—and I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with Bbulas.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If that doesn't,&quot; Bbulas said, &quot;I have other methods of inspiration.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Skkiru answered sulkily. &quot;I'll go to the edge of the field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing it, and I don't intend to like doing it.&quot;&#10; &#10; All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. &quot;I'm proud of you, Skkiru,&quot; she said brokenly.&#10; &#10; Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a triple silence.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,&quot; Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans" />
    <node id="1. Skkiru is experiencing melancholy pleasure because he finds solidarity in the discomfort of the procession, including the privileged ones. Despite their wealth and status, they are not immune to the unpleasant conditions of the wet season on Snaddra.&#10;2. This observation brings to mind an old idea Skkiru had from a Terrestrial sporting fictape about a weather-resistant garment or device, which he had always planned to experiment with but never got around to due to various reasons.&#10;3. His current situation of being reduced to beggarhood and struggling in the mud might have heightened his appreciation for this old idea and brought him some comfort in knowing that such a thing could potentially help him in his current circumstances." />

The Snaddrath had no means of land transport, having previously found it unnecessary—but now both air-cars and self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently primitive.&#10; &#10; The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly in the wet season or—more properly speaking on Snaddra—the wetter season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be humanoid.&#10; &#10; As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to—the weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more comfortable sports," />

    <node id=" triple silence.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,&quot; Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes, and singing a popular ballad—to which less ribald, as well as less inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.&#10; &#10; &quot;Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,&quot; chanted Skkiru the beggar. His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor—now a pariah, of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers—and the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when taking off and landing. The Snaddr" />
    <node id=" &#10; But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his anthropological viewings—though Bbulas might have been the only one privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was not the only one who could use a library—seen accounts of societies where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy of the high priestess's hand—which would be entirely in the Terran primitive tradition of romance.&#10; &#10; &quot;Skkiru!&quot; Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were out of ear- and eye-shot &quot;Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?&quot;&#10; &#10; Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. &quot;Just some old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of collecting junk and I thought—&quot;&#10; &#10; Bbulas twirled madly in the air. &quot;You" />
    <node id=", and others prunes, like the beggarship.&#10; &#10; What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg? Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death. It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral, although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die for his planet in many ways—but wantonly starving to death as the result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.&#10; &#10; All the same, Skkiru" />

However, he still had the equipment, which he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment—and it was the matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way, and get it.&#10; &#10; Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.&#10; &#10; In fact, the Terrestrials were quite" />
    <node id="In the story, Bbulas assumes the role of controlling the thinking process by insisting that Skkiru should not think but leave all the thinking to him. Bbulas has manipulated the situation so that he can be near Larhgan and exercise control over their lives as the Official Dilettante. He has made Skkiru a beggar and Larhgan the high priestess in their new way of life, causing tension between Skkiru and Larhgan, who were engaged to be married under the old system. Bbulas' insincere regret and feigned apology to Skkiru suggest that he is aware of the negative impact of his actions but continues to prioritize his own desires over their relationships.&#10;&#10;Skkiru, on the other hand, struggles with being controlled by Bbulas and having limited agency in the new way of life. He resents Bbulas for manipulating the situation to his advantage and causing tension between him and Larhgan. Skkiru's grief and rage over the new arrangement suggest that he is not content with his role and feels powerless to change it.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bbulas controls the thinking process by making decisions for Skkiru and Larhgan, while Skkiru struggles against this control and seeks to regain agency in their lives." />
    <node id=", and the lots were a lot of slibwash.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hurry up, Skkiru.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his own appearance—which was, although picturesque enough to delight romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most hardened sadist.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hurry up, Skkiru,&quot; Bbulas said. &quot;They mustn't suspect the existence of the city underground or we're finished before we've started.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;For my part, I wish we'd never started,&quot; Skkiru grumbled. &quot;What was wrong with our old culture, anyway?&quot;&#10; &#10; That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate his mind that school-days were long since over.&#10; &#10; &quot;I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,&quot; he said, with affected" />

It is implied that the missionaries were eaten by these beings.&#10;3. The explorers do not seem too concerned about the fate of the missionaries and even find it amusing, suggesting a level of callousness or indifference towards their well-being.&#10;4.

The natives tried to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, they were cannibals?&quot; the other Earthman asked, so respectfully that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. &quot;How horrible!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, not at all,&quot; the other assured him. &quot;They weren't human—another species entirely—so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And the missionaries—did they soften them up, Cyril?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They softened up the missionaries, I believe.&quot; Cyril laughed. &quot;Ah, well, it's all in the day's work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I hope these creatures are not man-eaters" />
    <node id=" Cyril laughed. &quot;Ah, well, it's all in the day's work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,&quot; Raoul commented, with a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming procession— creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.&#10;&quot;We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, you will, my boy, you will.&quot; Cyril clapped the younger man on the shoulder. &quot;I have every confidence in your ability.&quot;&#10; &#10; Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials—which had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.&#10; &#10; &quot;The natives certainly appear to be human enough,&quot; Raoul added, with an appreciative glance" />
    <node id="I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,&quot; he said, with affected weariness. &quot;After all, most civilized societies are basically similar; it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the other—and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;For Snaddra,&quot; Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart in a gesture which, though devout on Earth—or so the fictapes seemed to indicate—was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been such a nice girl, too.&#10; &#10; &quot;We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,&quot; she told him, with a long," />

His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal healthy emerald to a sickly celadon.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be—a robot would be better constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.&#10; &#10; &quot;Remember,&quot; Cyril said sternly, &quot;we must not establish undue rapport with the native females.

Bbulas and some workmen had done all that themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and much more cheaply.&#10; &#10; It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life. What resources it once possessed had been depleted and—aside from minerals—they had never been very extensive to begin with. All life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and rice—the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist business.&#10; &#10; Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The" />

Larhgan's decision to set herself apart from mundane affairs and pretend to be happy results in her becoming the high priestess in their new way of life, while Skkiru is made a beggar. This arrangement causes tension between them, as they were engaged to be married under the old system, and Skkiru resents Bbulas for manipulating the situation to his advantage.&#10;2. When Skkiru realizes the outrageousness of the situation, especially with the arrival of an Earth ship, he becomes enraged and grief-stricken. He turns a triple somersault in the air with rage and confronts Bbulas about his role in the new arrangement. At this point, Larhgan confirms that the new roles will be permanent, and Skkiru will only be able to see her from a distance on feast days, which deepens his despair." />
    <node id="1. The inhabitants of Snaddra are required to follow the outcome of a lottery that assigns them different roles in their society because of the Bbulas Plan, which was adopted by a majority vote as an emergency measure to save the planet. This plan was put into place due to the depletion of Snaddra's resources and the near extinction of most life-forms on the planet. The lottery is used to assign roles such as beggars or workers in order to distribute resources and responsibilities fairly among the population.&#10;2. If someone were to defy these assigned roles, it would likely disrupt the functioning of the Bbulas Plan and potentially create inequality and conflict within Snaddran society. It is not specified what the exact consequences would be for defying one's assigned role, but it can be inferred that there would be some form of social or legal repercussions to maintain order and adherence to the plan." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve the planet when an emergency came—and this, old Luccar, the former President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had, after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method of saving Snaddra—and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last, had come up with this program.&#10; &#10; It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath, largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and, as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of the planet, there was no choice.&#10; &#10; But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself.

To avoid being disqualified from becoming part of the new culture's mythos, Larhgan must stop putting herself in a position that represents a trait out of keeping with the new culture and is unseemly with the high priestess's robes. Bbulas suggests this when he mentions her current behavior being at odds with their new way of life.&#10;2. Skkiru realizes there must be another solution to the planet's problem as an Earth ship arrives because he suddenly understands the outrageousness of the situation and how it was manipulated by Bbulas. He believes that the arrival of the Earth ship signals a point of no return, which makes him feel desperate, realizing that their new roles will be permanent and Larhgan will only be able to see him from a distance on feast days. This is when he turns a triple somersault in the air with rage, confronting Bbulas about his role in the new arrangement." />

Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. &quot;You don't seem to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.

The Snaddran woman, Larhgan, offers a warm welcome to the explorers from Earth, speaking in a melodious voice and emphasizing the hospitality and love that her people will offer them. She hopes that they will enjoy their stay on Snaddra, which may be small but has large-hearted inhabitants. She ends by expressing her hope that the men of Earth will carry back their affection to all the peoples of the Galaxy.&#10;2. Cyril responds with a polite speech, thanking Larhgan and her people for their gracious invitation and cordial reception. He assures them that they will make their analysis of Snaddrath culture as painless as possible and emphasizes that they have no intention of tampering with it in any way.&#10;3. Raoul is too distracted by Larhgan's beauty to pay much attention to Cyril's speech, while Cyril seems unconcerned about the fate of the missionaries who preceded them. The story implies that they may have been eaten by the Snaddrath beings, but neither Cyril nor Raoul show any concern or alarm at this possibility.&#10;4. The focus of the story is not on the cannibalistic behavior of the Snaddrath beings, but rather on their relationship with the Terrans who come to study them. The fact that they are cannibals is mentioned in passing and does not seem to be a major source of concern for either side." />

He saw the gulf that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so lovely and so remote.&#10; &#10; &quot;... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,&quot; she was saying in her melodious voice. &quot;Our resources may be small but our hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here as you did on Nemeth....&quot;&#10; &#10; Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much attention to the expression on his companion's face.&#10; &#10; &quot;... and that you" />

And now Cyril cleared his throat. &quot;Dear friends, we were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.&quot;&#10; &#10; The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on, apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.&#10; &#10; &quot;We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study your society, not to tamper with it in any way.&quot;&#10;  Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha!&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;But why is it,&quot; Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of the corners of his eyes, &quot;that only the beggar wears mudshoes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shhh,&quot; Cyril hissed back" />
    <node id=" attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color, such aroma!&quot;&#10; &#10; Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.&#10; &#10; &quot;But,&quot; Raoul went on, &quot;one can have too much of even such a good thing as mud....&quot;&#10; &#10; The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. &quot;Yes, of course, honorable Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.&quot;&#10; &#10; He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However, that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability. In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned the various roles so that each person would be making a definite contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums, like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.&#10; &#10; What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing around begging" />
    <node id="1. After Skkiru managed to arrive at the Earth ship ahead of the official greeters using his salvaged land transport equipment, he discovered that the humanoid newcomers were pasty-skinned and lacked antennae, which distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much as the Snaddrath had been before they adopted primitive garb." />
    <node id="1. The story suggests that Skkiru was initially reluctant to cooperate with Bbulas' plan to make him a beggar and Larhgan the high priestess in their new way of life. However, Bbulas had manipulated the situation so that he could be near Larhgan and exercise control over their lives as the Official Dilettante. Skkiru may have felt pressured to comply with Bbulas' plan due to his position of power and authority.&#10;2. Additionally, the story mentions that Skkiru had always planned to experiment with primitive forms of transportation, such as a land vehicle, but had never gotten around to it. When Bbulas suggested using such a mode of transportation to reach the Earth ship, Skkiru may have felt obligated to comply since it aligned with his own interests and desires.&#10;3. Ultimately, the story does not provide explicit details on what convinced Skkiru to cooperate with Bbulas' plan. However, it is likely that a combination of feeling pressured by Bbulus' position of power and authority, as well as a desire to pursue his own interests in primitive transportation, contributed to his decision to abandon his normal habits and customs." />
    <node id="Larhgan's change in behavior is due to their new way of life, which requires adapting to be more attractive to Earthmen and differentiate themselves from other civilized societies. She places significant importance on their mission for Snaddra's sake, as evidenced by her decision to become the high priestess in their new culture and her reminder to Skkiru about the mission. The obscene gesture she performs, which is devout on Earth, indicates a shift towards Terran influence in their society. Larhgan understands that adopting certain aspects of Terrestrial culture will help them appeal to Earthmen and secure their future, hence emphasizing its significance throughout the story." />
    <node id="1. The capital has risen to the surface and the other cities are following suit, leading to a careful system of tabus to keep the Earthmen from discovering the existence of the underground cities.&#10;2. Skkiru has been made a beggar by Bbulas, who has also made Larhgan the high priestess in their new way of life. This arrangement causes tension between Skkiru and Larhgan, who were engaged to be married under the old system.&#10;3. Skkiru has been injured professionally by not being allowed to help in planning the huts for the Earthmen, which Bbulas and some workmen have done with the aid of antique blueprints.&#10;4. Skkiru has always planned to experiment with primitive forms of transportation, but has never gotten around to it. When Bbulas suggests using such a mode of transportation to reach the Earth ship, Skkiru may feel obligated to comply since it aligns with his own interests and desires.&#10;&#10;These circumstances have led Skkiru to reflect on the ignominy of subsisting on government aid and being unable to see Larhgan, despite considering emigrating to another city or seeking revenge by not helping in planning the huts." />
    <node id=" ways—but wantonly starving to death as the result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.&#10; &#10; All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.&#10; &#10; He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of them, and stave off his doom for a while—but that would not be playing the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.&#10; &#10; As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put out centuries before by a" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, it seems that Bulbas' decision to hold a ceremony to stop rain is due to the emergency situation that the planet Snaddra is facing, with depleted resources and the near extinction of many life-forms. The Bbulas Plan, which was adopted by a majority vote, uses a lottery to assign roles such as beggars or workers in order to distribute resources and responsibilities fairly among the population.&#10;&#10;While Bulbas does seem quick-witted, it is mentioned that he lacks genuine organizational ability and created some positions as &quot;plums&quot; (such as the priesthood) and others as &quot;prunes&quot; (such as the beggarship). The story suggests that Bulbas could have used his time more productively by planning and carrying out a more organized scheme for the improvement of Snaddra. However, it is possible that Bulbas believed that addressing the immediate issue of the heavy rains causing further damage to the planet was a higher priority than long-term planning.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that the story implies that Snaddrath society has been influenced by Terrestrial culture, and Bulbas' decision to hold a ceremony may be influenced by this as well. The Snaddrath people seem to place significant importance on their relationship with the Terrans who come to study them, and adopting certain aspects of Terrestrial culture may help them appeal to Earthmen and secure their future." />
    <node id="Based on the story, Bbulas argued that their old culture was too similar to that of the Terra\-nals and therefore would not be of interest to them. He believed that adopting a new way of life that mimicked the Terrans was necessary for the survival of their planet, Snaddra. This change in culture included the manipulation of social ranks and positions, such as making Skkiru a beggar and Larhgan the high priestess, despite their engagement under the old system. Bbulas had always had feelings for Larhgan and used his position to arrange the situation to his advantage, causing tension and anxiety for all parties involved." />
    <node id="1. By &quot;aboveboard,&quot; Larhgan means that Snaddra society needs to present itself as respectable and civilized in the eyes of the Earthmen. This involves cutting ties with elements that are considered negative or primitive, such as beggars like Skkiru. She believes that by avoiding any association with Skkiru, they can create a more favorable impression on the Earthmen and increase their chances of securing a successful future for Snaddra.&#10;2. Larhgan emphasizes that the new roles in Snaddra's society will be permanent, meaning that she and Skkiru will have to maintain their respective positions as high priestess and beggar indefinitely. She highlights the significance of this situation by saying &quot;it's forever,&quot; indicating that there is no turning back or hope for change in the foreseeable future.&#10;3. Larhgan understands the importance of adopting certain aspects of Terran culture to appeal to Earthmen and secure their future, and she feels strongly about carrying out her role as high priestess in this new society. She believes that cutting ties with Skkiru will help them achieve these goals and ensure Snaddra's survival." />
    <node id="1. Skkiru's current circumstances of being reduced to beggarhood and struggling in the mud have caused him to reconsider trying out a new sport or device that could protect him from the unpleasant weather conditions on Snaddra.&#10;2. This idea comes from an old Terrestrial sporting fictape he had seen, which described a weather-resistant garment or device. Skkiru's situation has heightened his appreciation for this old idea and brought him some comfort in knowing that such a thing could potentially help him in his current circumstances.&#10;3. The fact that air-cars and self-levitation are now forbidden on Snaddra, making land transport unavailable, may have also contributed to Skkiru's consideration of this new sport or device as a means of improving his ability to navigate the planet's surface." />
    <node id="The conversation between Raoul and Cyril revolves around their initial observations of the Snaddrath natives they have encountered. They comment on the natives' physical appearance, with Raoul admiring the three-eyed females and finding them attractive. Cyril, on the other hand, is more focused on their mission and maintaining objectivity in their study. He reminds Raoul not to establish undue rapport with the native females, as it might compromise their research objectives.&#10;&#10;At this point in the story, there have been implications that the previous group of Terrans who visited Snaddra, referred to as missionaries, may have been eaten by the natives. However, neither Cyril nor Raoul show any concern or alarm at this possibility. Instead, they continue with their exploration and research focused conversation.&#10;&#10;The story's focus is not on the cannibalistic behavior of the Snaddrath beings but rather on the relationship between the Terrans who come to study them and the Snaddrath themselves. The fact that the beings are cannibals is mentioned in passing without significant emphasis, as it does not seem to be a major concern for either side." />
    <node id=". It tends to detract from true objectivity.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, Cyril,&quot; Raoul said meekly.&#10; &#10; Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect &quot;I should like to give this chap something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of exchange here?&quot;&#10;  Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this piece of information, helpful though it would be.&#10; &#10; &quot;How should I know?&quot; Raoul shrugged.&#10; &#10; &quot;Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?&quot; Raoul suggested grumpily.&#10;&quot;The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be a universal one.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!&quot;&#10; &#10; Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable—and entirely genuine—murmurs of gratitude.

    <node id="1. Survival and Future of Snaddra: Larhgan believes that adopting Terran ways is necessary to attract Earthmen and secure a successful future for Snaddra. She places significant importance on their mission for Snaddra's sake, as evidenced by her decision to become the high priestess in their new culture and her reminder to Skkiru about the mission. Larhgan understands that adopting certain aspects of Terrestrial culture will help them appeal to Earthmen and ensure their planet's survival.&#10;2. Competition with Other Civilized Societies: According to Bbulas, most civilized societies are basically similar, and it is only primitive societies that differ sharply. To attract Earthmen, who are &quot;pretty choosy,&quot; Snaddra needs to be different from other civilized societies. By adopting Terran ways, Larhgan aims to make Snaddra more appealing and increase their chances of securing a successful future.&#10;3. Inevitability of Change: The Terrestrial influence is already corrupting Larhgan, as evidenced by her obscene gesture that is devout on Earth. This shift towards Terran influence in their society indicates that adopting Terran ways may be inevitable for Snaddra's survival, despite the negative impact it has on their culture and personal relationships.&#10;&#10;In summary, Larhgan believes it's necessary to adopt Terran ways to attract Earthmen and ensure the survival and future of Snaddra. She understands that adopting certain aspects of Terrestrial culture will help them appeal to Earthmen and secure a successful future for their planet, despite the negative impact it has on their culture and personal relationships." />
    <node id="1. Bbulas' anxiety was due to his manipulation of the situation to make Skkiru a beggar and Larhgan the high priestess in their new way of life, which allowed him to be near Larhgan and exercise control over their lives. This arrangement also caused tension between Skkiru and Larhgan, who were engaged to be married under the old system, and Bbulas knew that Skkiru was aware of his feelings for Larhgan.&#10;2. Bbulas insisted that the choosing of Larhgan as high priestess was a matter of fate because he argued that their old culture was too similar to that of the Terra-nals and therefore would not be of interest to them. He believed that adopting a new way of life that mimicked the Terrans was necessary for the survival of their planet, Snaddra. By presenting Larhgan's selection as high priestess as fate, Bbulas could deflect any criticism or resistance to the change in social ranks and positions." />
    <node id="1. Skkiru ate the chocolate gift immediately despite his initial plan to save it for later because he realized that there would be no delicacy shops or chocolate available in their new way of life, and he wanted to make sure that Bbulas could not take possession of it. Eating the chocolate also provided him with immediate benefits, such as increasing his body's resistance to the unpleasant weather conditions on Snaddra.&#10;2. This act reveals Skkiru's thoughts on their desperate situation of survival on a dwindling planet because he expresses his regret and sadness about having to resort to such measures for nothing more than survival. He reflects on the fact that people on Earth often sicken of weather and pass on, which helps solve the problem of birth control, while Snaddra does not need such measures due to its rapidly dwindling population. Skkiru's moody contemplation as he eats the chocolate suggests his frustration and despair about their situation." />
    <node id=" shops—and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift to contribute it later to the Treasury, the &quot;high priest&quot; was off his rocker.&#10; &#10; To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession, Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much weather all at once.&#10; &#10; On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they often sickened of it and passed on—which helped to solve the problem of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed no such measures, for its population—like its natural resources—was dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small, momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks. For one thing, it was quite in character" />
    <node id="1. The metal-working industry on Snaddra is significant because it formed the basis of their chief industry and provided them with a large lowest caste. This is mentioned as having made things easy for Bbulas, who took the simple way out by not addressing the issue of relying on imports, such as cloth, which were necessary due to the lack of politically acceptable local alternatives.&#10;2. Larhgan and Bbulas play important roles in relation to the Earthmen visiting their temple. Larhgan has adopted Terran ways and become the high priestess in their new culture, believing it's necessary for Snaddra's survival and future. She places significant importance on their mission and reminds Skkiru about it. Bbulas, on the other hand, had always had feelings for Larhgan and manipulated the situation to make her the high priestess and Skkiru a beggar, which caused tension between them. He argued that their old culture was too similar to that of the Terra-nals and presented Larhgan's selection as high priestess as fate to deflect criticism or resistance." />
    <node id=". Since metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the easy way out.&#10; &#10; Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the &quot;high priest&quot; with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the Snaddrath depended upon imports.&#10; &#10; As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for" />

But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, &quot;And I suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the ground during the day, like—like savages.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is necessary,&quot; Bbulas replied without turning.&#10; &#10; &quot;Pooh,&quot; Skkiru said. &quot;Pooh, pooh , POOH!&quot;&#10; &#10; Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. &quot;Skkiru! Such language!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;As you said,&quot; Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at Skkiru, &quot;the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But I can't work metal!&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="1. Kiru's beggar status gave him certain advantages during his exploration of the strangers' heels to the temple because it was in character for him to be curious and tread on the strangers' heels, and as a beggar, he had more freedom to do so without being questioned or challenged. It also allowed him to stand around and observe the Earthmen, which he may not have been able to do as easily if he held a higher rank.&#10;2. The metal-workers being segregated from the rest on Snaddra is significant because metal-working is the chief industry of Snaddra, providing them with a large lowest caste. This is mentioned as having made things easy for Bbulas, who took the simple way out by not addressing the issue of relying on imports, such as cloth, which were necessary due to the lack of politically acceptable local alternatives. The segregation of metal-workers highlights the social stratification on Snaddra and the reliance on a specific industry for survival." />
    <node id="kiru discovered, did give him certain small, momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks. For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple—a ramshackle affair, but then it had been run up in only three days—where the official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that, because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at him—and not only for his forwardness—that was in character on both sides, too.&#10; &#10; Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising—a poetic thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the planet automatically with a large lowest caste.

    <node id="1. The Terrestrials, also known as humans or Earthmen, are a species from Earth. They are explorers and researchers who have arrived on the planet Snaddra to study the native Snaddrath species. They are characterized by their pasty skin color and lack of antennae, which distinguish them visibly from the Snaddrath.&#10;2. The Snaddrath expected the Terrestrials to be different because they had heard that humans were choosy about the civilizations they studied, preferring primitive societies over more advanced ones. Additionally, the Snaddrath believed that humans had something to hide due to their invention of retouching – an artistic technique used to alter images and conceal information. This belief may have led the Snaddrath to assume that humans would manipulate their appearance in pictures to make themselves seem more appealing or different from what they truly were.&#10;3. The Snaddrath had previously encountered humans on a planet called Glotch, located in the Arcturus system. However, this study was short-lived as they could not gather enough data for a comprehensive report. This brief encounter may have further contributed to their expectation of human appearance being different from what they actually look like." />
    <node id=" They were dressed much as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.&#10; &#10; In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms, entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had always understood, who had invented the art of retouching—thus proving beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look, Raoul,&quot; the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran—which the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable third language on most of the outer planets. &quot;A beggar. Haven't seen one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on that little planet in the Arcturus system—what was its name? Glotch, that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be.

    <node id="1. The concept of &quot;kismet&quot; in this context refers to fate or destiny, implying that the inhabitants of Snaddra are expected to accept their circumstances as predetermined and unchangeable. This is reinforced by the Bbulas Plan, which assigns roles to individuals through a lottery system.&#10;2. The consequences of not accepting one's circumstances as &quot;kismet&quot; are not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that there would be social or legal repercussions for defying one's assigned role. Bbulas warns Skkiru that if he touches him, there will be another drawing for beggar and Skkiru will be made a metal-worker, which implies some form of punishment for not accepting his circumstances.&#10;3. The severe libel laws on Snaddra also suggest that questioning the status quo is discouraged or even punishable. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting one's circumstances as &quot;kismet&quot; and not challenging the established order." />
    <node id="1. The Planetary Dilettante is a civil-service job on Snaddra, awarded to the person who scores highest in intelligence, character, and general gloonatz after a competitive examination. Their official function is to serve the planet during an emergency. They are sent to Gambrell to receive a Terran-type education, as individual Snaddrath cannot afford such schooling due to high transportation costs.&#10;2. The Planetary Dilettante in this story is Skkiru. He used old blueprints acquired from a tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell to build huts for the inhabitants of Snaddra. These blueprints were originally published centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been adapted to create primitive garb for the Snaddrath.&#10;3. The Planetary Dilettante helped Snaddra address their extinction-level crisis by finding a solution to the planet's resource depletion and near extinction of most life-forms. By building huts using the old blueprints, Skkiru provided new shelters for the Snaddrath, contributing to their survival.&#10;4. The Bbulas Plan was adopted as an emergency measure to save the planet, and the Planetary Dilettante played a role in implementing this plan by creating new living spaces for the inhabitants." />

However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm—and there, Skkiru felt, was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.&#10; &#10; The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the population.&#10; &#10; The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve the planet when an emergency came—and this, old" />

This arrangement is made by Bbulas, who had always had feelings for Larhgan and used his position to manipulate the situation to his advantage. The new roles cause tension between Skkiru and Larhgan, as they were engaged to be married under the old system. Skkiru becomes enraged and grief-stricken when he realizes the outrageousness of the situation, especially with the arrival of an Earth ship. He turns a triple somersault in the air with rage and confronts Bbulas about his role in the new arrangement. Larhgan confirms that the new roles will be permanent, and Skkiru will only be able to see her from a distance on feast days.&#10;2. Upon realizing the outrageousness of the situation, Skkiru becomes desperate as he understands that their new roles will be permanent and Larhgan will only be able to see him from a distance on feast days.

    <node id="1. During a brief exploration mission on Snaddra, Cyril and his companion Raoul encountered a non-human species who tried to eat them. They refer to this as &quot;not cannibalism&quot; since the beings they met were not human.&#10;2. The missionaries who followed the explorers attempted to convert these beings but were unsuccessful. Instead, it is implied that the missionaries were eaten by these beings.&#10;3. Cyril and Raoul do not show concern about the fate of the missionaries and even find it amusing, suggesting a level of callousness or indifference towards their well-being.&#10;4. The story focuses on the relationship between the Snaddrath and the Terrans who come to study them rather than the cannibalistic behavior of the Snaddrath beings. This behavior is mentioned in passing and does not seem to be a major concern for either side." />
    <node id="1. When Larhgan says that Snaddra must pretend to be an &quot;aboveboard&quot; society, she means that they need to present themselves as respectable and civilized in the eyes of the Earthmen. This involves cutting ties with elements that are considered negative or primitive, such as beggars like Skkiru.&#10;2. It is important for Snaddra to maintain this façade because by avoiding any association with Skkiru, they can create a more favorable impression on the Earthmen and increase their chances of securing a successful future for their planet. Larhgan emphasizes that the new roles in Snaddra's society will be permanent, indicating that there is no turning back or hope for change in the foreseeable future.&#10;3. By placing significant importance on their mission for Snaddra's sake and becoming the high priestess in their new culture, Larhgan believes that adopting Terran ways is necessary to attract Earthmen and ensure their planet's survival.

The story suggests that Bulbas could have used his time more productively by planning and carrying out a more organized scheme for the improvement of Snaddra. However, it is possible that Bulbas believed that addressing the immediate issue of the heavy rains causing further damage to the planet was a higher priority than long-term planning.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that the story implies that Snaddrath society has been influenced by Terrestrial culture, and Bulbas' decision to hold a ceremony may be influenced by this as well. The Snaddrath people seem to place significant importance on their relationship with the Terrans who come to study them, and adopting certain aspects of Terrestrial culture may help them appeal to Earthmen and secure their future.">

The metal-workers being segregated from the rest on Snaddra is significant because metal-working is the chief industry of Snaddra, providing them with a large lowest caste. This is mentioned as having made things easy for Bbulas, who took the simple way out by not addressing the issue of relying on imports, such as cloth, which were necessary due to the lack of politically acceptable local alternatives.

The Snaddrath expected the Terrestrials to be different because they had heard that humans were choosy about the civilizations they studied, preferring primitive societies over more advanced ones. Additionally, the Snaddrath believed that humans had something to hide due to their invention of retouching – an artistic technique used to alter images and conceal information.

They are characterized by their pasty skin color and lack of antennae, which distinguish them visibly from the Snaddrath.&#10;2. The Snaddrath expected the Terrestrials to be different because they had heard that humans were choosy about the civilizations they studied, preferring primitive societies over more advanced ones. Additionally, the Snaddrath believed that humans had something to hide due to their invention of retouching – an artistic technique used to alter images and conceal information. This belief may have led the Snaddrath to assume that humans would manipulate their appearance in pictures to make themselves seem more appealing or different from what they truly were.&#10;3. The Snaddrath had previously encountered humans on a planet called Glotch, located in the Arcturus system.

The Terrestrials, also known as humans or Earthmen, are a species from Earth. They are explorers and researchers who have arrived on the planet Snaddra to study the native Snaddrath species. They are characterized by their pasty skin color and lack of antennae, which distinguish them visibly from the Snaddrath.&#10;2. The Snaddrath expected the Terrestrials to be different because they had heard that humans were choosy about the civilizations they studied, preferring primitive societies over more advanced ones. Additionally, the Snaddrath believed that humans had something to hide due to their invention of retouching – an artistic technique used to alter images and conceal information. This belief may have led the Snaddrath to assume that humans would manipulate their appearance in pictures to make themselves seem more appealing or different from what they truly were.&#10;3. The Snaddrath had previously encountered humans on a planet called Glotch, located in the Arcturus system. However, this study was short-lived as they could not gather enough data for a comprehensive report. This brief encounter may have further contributed to their expectation of human appearance being different from what they actually look like.">

The Snaddrath expected the Terrestrials to be different because they had heard that humans were choosy about the civilizations they studied, preferring primitive societies over more advanced ones. Additionally, the Snaddrath believed that humans had something to hide due to their invention of retouching – an artistic technique used to alter images and conceal information. This belief may have led the Snaddrath to assume that humans would manipulate their appearance in pictures to make themselves seem more appealing or different from what they truly were.&#10;3.

The Snaddrath expected the Terrestrials to be different because they had heard that humans were choosy about the civilizations they studied, preferring primitive societies over more advanced ones. Additionally, the Snaddrath believed that humans had something to hide due to their invention of retouching – an artistic technique used to alter images and conceal information.

By building huts using the old blueprints, Skkiru provided new shelters for the Snaddrath, contributing to their survival.&#10;4. The Bbulas Plan was adopted as an emergency measure to save the planet, and the Planetary Dilettante played a role in implementing this plan by creating new living spaces for the inhabitants." target=" be done, if it were not to decay altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm—and there, Skkiru felt, was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.&#10; &#10; The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the population.&#10; &#10; The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve the planet when an emergency came—and this, old">

They refer to this as &quot;not cannibalism&quot; since the beings they met were not human.&#10;2. The missionaries who followed the explorers attempted to convert these beings but were unsuccessful. Instead, it is implied that the missionaries were eaten by these beings.&#10;3. Cyril and Raoul do not show concern about the fate of the missionaries and even find it amusing, suggesting a level of callousness or indifference towards their well-being.&#10;4. The story focuses on the relationship between the Snaddrath and the Terrans who come to study them rather than the cannibalistic behavior of the Snaddrath beings. This behavior is mentioned in passing and does not seem to be a major concern for either side." target="1. The conversation between Raoul and Cyril revolves around their initial observations of the Snaddrath natives they have encountered. They comment on the natives' physical appearance, with Raoul admiring the three-eyed females and finding them attractive.&#10;2. Cyril reminds Raoul not to establish undue rapport with the native females because he wants to maintain objectivity in their study and not compromise their research objectives. This is a common principle in anthropological and sociological studies to avoid bias and ensure accurate observations and data collection.">

When Larhgan says that Snaddra must pretend to be an &quot;aboveboard&quot; society, she means that they need to present themselves as respectable and civilized in the eyes of the Earthmen. This involves cutting ties with elements that are considered negative or primitive, such as beggars like Skkiru.&#10;2. It is important for Snaddra to maintain this façade because by avoiding any association with Skkiru, they can create a more favorable impression on the Earthmen and increase their chances of securing a successful future for their planet. Larhgan emphasizes that the new roles in Snaddra's society will be permanent, indicating that there is no turning back or hope for change in the foreseeable future.&#10;3. By placing significant importance on their mission for Snaddra's sake and becoming the high priestess in their new culture, Larhgan believes that adopting Terran ways is necessary to attract Earthmen and ensure their planet's survival. She understands that cutting ties with Skkiru will help them achieve these goals and secure a successful future for Snaddra." target="The beautiful and dignified woman, Larhgan, offers a warm welcome to the explorers from Earth in several thousand words. Her choice of words emphasizes the hospitality and love that the people of Snaddra will offer them, despite their small resources. She hopes that the men of Earth will enjoy a long and happy stay on Snaddra and carry back their affection to all the peoples of the Galaxy. Larhgan's words reflect her community's large-heartedness, which outweighs any shortcomings in material wealth.">

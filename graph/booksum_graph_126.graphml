    <node id="The board, after considering Mr. Gamfield's proposition to take Oliver Twist as an apprentice, did not approve of it. This decision might have been influenced by the imputation that Mr. Gamfield had bruised three or four boys to death already, as it was mentioned that he &quot;laboured under the slight imputation&quot; and it occurred to him that this fact might have affected the board's proceedings. However, the narrative does not explicitly state that the board's decision was directly influenced by this imputation." />
    <node id=" much amused by this&#10;explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.&#10;Limbkins.  The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a&#10;few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words 'saving of&#10;expenditure,' 'looked well in the accounts,' 'have a printed report&#10;published,' were alone audible.  These only chanced to be heard,&#10;indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great&#10;emphasis.&#10;&#10;At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having&#10;resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:&#10;&#10;'We have considered your proposition, and we don't approve of it.'&#10;&#10;'Not at all,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.&#10;&#10;'Decidedly not,' added the other members.&#10;&#10;As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of&#10;having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him&#10;that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into&#10;their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their&#10;proceedings.

Having completed these&#10;arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.&#10;&#10;The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with&#10;his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound&#10;sentiments in the board-room.  Having witnessed the little dispute&#10;between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that&#10;person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield&#10;was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield&#10;smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the&#10;sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was&#10;encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse&#10;was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing&#10;for register stoves.  So, he spelt the bill through again, from&#10;beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,&#10;accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.&#10;&#10;'This here boy," />

Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his finances&#10;could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;&#10;and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately&#10;cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his&#10;eyes encountered the bill" />
    <node id=" arithmetical desperation, he was alternately&#10;cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his&#10;eyes encountered the bill on the gate.&#10;&#10;'Wo--o!' said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.&#10;&#10;The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,&#10;whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when&#10;he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was&#10;laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.&#10;&#10;Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but&#10;more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow&#10;on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a&#10;donkey's.  Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp&#10;wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and&#10;by these means turned him round.  He then gave him another blow on the&#10;head, just to stun him till he came back again.  Having completed these&#10;arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to" />

I'll split the diff'erence, gen'l'men,' urged Gamfield. 'Three&#10;pound fifteen.'&#10;&#10;'Not a farthing more,' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.&#10;&#10;'You're desperate hard upon me, gen'l'men,' said Gamfield, wavering.&#10;&#10;'Pooh!  pooh!  nonsense!' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.&#10;'He'd be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly&#10;fellow!  He's just the boy for you.  He wants the stick, now and then:&#10;it'll do him good; and his board needn't come very expensive, for he&#10;hasn't been overfed since he was born.  Ha! " />

'What of him?'&#10;&#10;'If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a&#10;good 'spectable chimbley-sweepin' bisness,' said Mr. Gamfield, 'I wants&#10;a 'prentis, and I am ready to take him.'&#10;&#10;'Walk in,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr. Gamfield&#10;having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,&#10;and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his&#10;absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room&#10;where Oliver had first seen him.&#10;&#10;'It's a nasty trade,' said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated&#10;his wish.&#10;&#10;'Young boys have been smothered in chimneys" />
    <node id="Noah implies that Oliver Twist's mother was a morally corrupt and immoral person, suggesting that she had a negative reputation or behavior. The term &quot;bad 'un&quot; was used in the text to refer to someone who is disreputable or criminal." />
    <node id="impudent.  _Your_ mother, too!  She was a nice 'un she was.  Oh, Lor!'&#10;And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of&#10;his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the&#10;occasion.&#10;&#10;'Yer know, Work'us,' continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver's silence,&#10;and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most&#10;annoying: 'Yer know, Work'us, it can't be helped now; and of course yer&#10;couldn't help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I'm sure we all&#10;are, and pity yer very much.  But yer must know, Work'us, yer mother&#10;was a regular right-down bad 'un.'&#10;&#10;'What did you say?' inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.&#10;&#10;'A regular right-down bad 'un, Work'us,' replied Noah, coolly. 'And&#10;it's a great deal better, Work'us, that she died when she did, or else&#10;she'd have been hard labouring in Bridewell" />
    <node id=" there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole,&#10;being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a&#10;worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.&#10;&#10;Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the&#10;table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his ears; and&#10;expressed his opinion that he was a 'sneak'; and furthermore announced&#10;his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable&#10;event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty&#10;annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.&#10;But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and&#10;in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want&#10;to be funny.  He got rather personal.&#10;&#10;'Work'us,' said Noah, 'how's your mother?'&#10;&#10;'She's dead,' replied Oliver; 'don't you say anything about her to me!'&#10;&#10;Oliver's colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there&#10;was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole&#10;thought" />
    <node id="&#10;well.  Eh, Charlotte?  He! he! he!'&#10;&#10;'Oh, you queer soul!' said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in&#10;which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully&#10;at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest&#10;corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially&#10;reserved for him.&#10;&#10;Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.  No chance-child&#10;was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his&#10;parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his&#10;father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal&#10;pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.  The&#10;shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding&#10;Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of&#10;'leathers,' 'charity,' and the like; and Noah had bourne them without&#10;reply.  But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at&#10;" />
    <node id=" cocked hat,--which is a very&#10;curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,&#10;acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a&#10;momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of&#10;personal dignity.&#10;&#10;'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!' said Noah:  'Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--'&#10;&#10;'What?  What?' interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his&#10;metallic eyes. 'Not run away; he hasn't run away, has he, Noah?'&#10;&#10;'No, sir, no.  Not run away, sir, but he's turned wicious,' replied&#10;Noah. 'He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder&#10;Charlotte; and then missis.  Oh! what dreadful pain it is!&#10;&#10;Such agony, please, sir!'  And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body&#10;into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr.&#10;Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of&#10;Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage" />
    <node id=" scattered over his forehead.&#10;The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled&#10;out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite&#10;undismayed.&#10;&#10;'Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?' said Sowerberry; giving&#10;Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.&#10;&#10;'He called my mother names,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?' said Mrs.&#10;Sowerberry.  'She deserved what he said, and worse.'&#10;&#10;'She didn't' said Oliver.&#10;&#10;'She did,' said Mrs. Sowerberry.&#10;&#10;'It's a lie!' said Oliver.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.&#10;&#10;This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative.  If he had&#10;hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be&#10;quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,&#10;according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a&#10;brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of&#10;a man" />
    <node id=" breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which&#10;Noah had poured over her head and shoulders.  'Oh! Charlotte, what a&#10;mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!'&#10;&#10;'Ah! mercy indeed, ma'am,' was the reply.  I only hope this'll teach&#10;master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born&#10;to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah!  He was&#10;all but killed, ma'am, when I come in.'&#10;&#10;'Poor fellow!' said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the&#10;charity-boy.&#10;&#10;Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level&#10;with the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his&#10;wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed&#10;some affecting tears and sniffs.&#10;&#10;'What's to be done!' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.  'Your master's not at&#10;home; there's not a man in the house, and he'll kick that door down in&#10;ten minutes.'  Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in&#10;question" />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that both Oliver Twist and those around him have different reactions to the deaths of their loved ones. When Oliver's mother is mentioned, he becomes visibly upset, causing Noah Claypole to mistakenly assume that she was a morally corrupt person. However, it is clear that Oliver deeply loved his mother and is pained by her memory.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, when Noah Claypole talks about the deaths of others, he does so in a flippant and mocking tone, showing a lack of empathy and respect for the deceased. This behavior is reflected in how he treats Oliver after bringing up his mother's death - Noah becomes more aggressive and abusive towards him, using it as a way to assert dominance and belittle Oliver's status as an orphan and workhouse resident.&#10;&#10;Overall, the reactions to death among the characters in this narrative vary greatly, with some showing genuine grief and others displaying a lack of compassion and empathy. This affects how they interact with each other, particularly in the case of Noah Claypole's treatment of Oliver Twist." />

Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far&#10;from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to&#10;render it as becoming and attractive as possible.  It was observable,&#10;too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during&#10;the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached&#10;home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.  All&#10;this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with&#10;great admiration.&#10;&#10;That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good&#10;people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm&#10;with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for&#10;many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and&#10;ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now&#10;that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the&#10;black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in&#10;the muffin-cap and leathers.  Charlotte treated him ill" />
    <node id="The parish beadle, Mr. Bumble, is tasked by a gentleman in a white waistcoat to visit the Sowerberry's shop and manage the situation with Oliver Twist. Specifically, Mr. Bumble is asked not to spare Oliver when doling out punishment, if necessary. Accordingly, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole make their way to the undertaker's establishment. The passage indicates that they adjust their hats and canes before setting off, and then proceed directly to Sowerberry's shop." />
    <node id="  'And please, sir, missis wants to know&#10;whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog&#10;him--'cause master's out.'&#10;&#10;'Certainly, my boy; certainly,' said the gentleman in the white&#10;waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah's head, which was about&#10;three inches higher than his own.  'You're a good boy--a very good boy.&#10;Here's a penny for you.  Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your&#10;cane, and see what's best to be done. Don't spare him, Bumble.'&#10;&#10;'No, I will not, sir,' replied the beadle.  And the cocked hat and cane&#10;having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner's satisfaction, Mr.&#10;Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the&#10;undertaker's shop.&#10;&#10;Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.

'Here! I've brought&#10;the boy.'  Oliver made a bow.&#10;&#10;'Oh! that's the boy, is it?' said the undertaker:  raising the candle&#10;above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. 'Mrs. Sowerberry, will&#10;you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?'&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and&#10;presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish&#10;countenance.&#10;&#10;'My dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, 'this is the boy from&#10;the workhouse that I told you of" />

An old black cloak had been&#10;thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin&#10;having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,&#10;and carried into the street.&#10;&#10;'Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!' whispered&#10;Sowerberry in the old woman's ear; 'we are rather late; and it won't&#10;do, to keep the clergyman waiting.  Move on, my men,--as quick as you&#10;like!'&#10;&#10;Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the&#10;two mourners kept as near them, as they could.  Mr. Bumble and&#10;Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs&#10;were not so long as his master's, ran by the side.&#10;&#10;There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had" />

Noah, look" />
    <node id=" and the like; and Noah had bourne them without&#10;reply.  But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at&#10;whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on&#10;him with interest.  This affords charming food for contemplation.  It&#10;shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how&#10;impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord&#10;and the dirtiest charity-boy.&#10;&#10;Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a&#10;month.  Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking&#10;their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after&#10;several deferential glances at his wife, said,&#10;&#10;'My dear--'  He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,&#10;with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.&#10;&#10;'Well,' said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.&#10;&#10;'Nothing, my dear, nothing,' said Mr. Sowerberry.&#10;&#10;'Ugh, you" />
    <node id=" fun being over so soon.&#10;&#10;'Come, my good fellow!' said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. 'They&#10;want to shut up the yard.'&#10;&#10;The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the&#10;grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had&#10;addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a&#10;swoon.  The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss&#10;of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any&#10;attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came&#10;to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed&#10;on their different ways.&#10;&#10;'Well, Oliver,' said Sowerberry, as they walked home, 'how do you like&#10;it?'&#10;&#10;'Pretty well, thank you, sir' replied Oliver, with considerable&#10;hesitation.  'Not very much, sir.'&#10;&#10;'Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,' said Sowerberry. 'Nothing&#10;when you _are_ used to it, my boy.'" />
    <node id="Mr. Sowerberry is suggesting that Oliver Twist could serve as a &quot;mute&quot; for children's funerals, someone who stands silently and solemnly during the procession and ceremony. This would be a new idea and have a &quot;superb effect,&quot; according to Mr. Sowerberry. Mrs. Sowerberry expresses concerns about her dignity being compromised if she openly agrees to this suggestion, but she ultimately approves of it. She has a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, which suggests that she takes pride in their business and wants to maintain a certain reputation. She may also be hesitant to take on another child, as they already have Charlotte and Noah in their care." />

It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as&#10;a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most&#10;curious to hear.  After a short duration, the permission was most&#10;graciously conceded.&#10;&#10;'It's only about young Twist, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry. 'A very&#10;good-looking boy, that, my dear.'&#10;&#10;'He need be, for he eats enough,' observed the lady.&#10;&#10;'There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,' resumed Mr.&#10;Sowerberry, 'which is very interesting.  He would make a delightful&#10;mute, my love.'&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable&#10;wonderment.  Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for&#10;any observation on the good lady's part, proceeded.&#10;&#10;'I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but&#10;only for children's practice.

'I thought you&#10;didn't want to hear, my dear.  I was only going to say--'&#10;&#10;'Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say,' interposed Mrs.&#10;Sowerberry.  'I am nobody; don't consult me, pray.  _I_ don't want to&#10;intrude upon your secrets.'  As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an&#10;hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.&#10;&#10;'But, my dear,' said Sowerberry, 'I want to ask your advice.'&#10;&#10;'No, no, don't ask mine,' replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting&#10;manner: 'ask somebody else's.'

It would be very new to have a mute in&#10;proportion, my dear.  You may depend upon it, it would have a superb&#10;effect.'&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,&#10;was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been&#10;compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,&#10;she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious&#10;suggestion had not presented itself to her husband's mind before?  Mr.&#10;Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his&#10;proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should&#10;be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this&#10;view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of&#10;his services being required.&#10;&#10;The occasion was not long in coming.  Half an hour after breakfast next&#10;morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against&#10;the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket" />
    <node id="1. Hunger and recent ill-treatment: Oliver is hungry and has recently been ill-treated, which makes it easy for him to cry.&#10;2. Separation from the familiar: Leaving the only home he has ever known and the people he considers his friends, however wretched they may be, brings about a sense of loneliness and fear in Oliver, contributing to his overwhelming emotion.&#10;3. Intimidation by Mr. Bumble: Mr. Bumble's stern demeanor and use of physical force (tapping him with the cane) further distress Oliver, making it difficult for him to stop crying.&#10;4. Pity and empathy from Mr. Bumble: When Oliver begs not to be punished and displays genuine fear and sadness, Mr. Bumble hesitates and shows some astonishment. This brief moment of understanding might make Oliver feel a glimmer of hope, which in turn contributes to his emotional state.&#10;5. Fear and anxiety about the unknown: Being in an unfamiliar situation with new people (the magistrate and the gentlemen) adds to Oliver's fear and inability to control his emotions." />
    <node id="'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.&#10;&#10;'Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.'&#10;&#10;Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of&#10;his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them&#10;when he looked up at his conductor.  As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon&#10;him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another.&#10;The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.&#10;Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble's he covered his face with&#10;both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and&#10;bony fingers.&#10;&#10;'Well!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little&#10;charge a look of intense malignity.  'Well!  Of _all_ the&#10;ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are&#10;the--'&#10;&#10;'No, no, sir,' sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the&#10;well-known cane; 'no, no," />
    <node id=" address in&#10;an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child's face, and he&#10;sobbed bitterly.&#10;&#10;'Come,' said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying&#10;to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;&#10;'Come, Oliver!  Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't&#10;cry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.'  It&#10;certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.&#10;&#10;On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all&#10;he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the&#10;gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like&#10;it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:&#10;the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in&#10;either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When&#10;they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself,&#10;and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back" />
    <node id=" he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at&#10;going away.  It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears&#10;into his eyes.  Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you&#10;want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.  Mrs. Mann gave&#10;him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a&#10;piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got&#10;to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little&#10;brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.&#10;Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never&#10;lighted the gloom of his infant years.  And yet he burst into an agony&#10;of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him.  Wretched as&#10;were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were&#10;the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in&#10;the great wide world, sank into the child's heart for the first time.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping&#10;his gold-laced cuff," />
    <node id=" not quite&#10;certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.  He had no time to think&#10;about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head,&#10;with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him&#10;lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large&#10;white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round&#10;a table.  At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher&#10;than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red&#10;face.&#10;&#10;'Bow to the board,' said Bumble.  Oliver brushed away two or three&#10;tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the&#10;table, fortunately bowed to that.&#10;&#10;'What's your name, boy?' said the gentleman in the high chair.&#10;&#10;Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him&#10;tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him&#10;cry.  These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating&#10;voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool" />
    <node id="'&#10;&#10;'No, no, sir,' sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the&#10;well-known cane; 'no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I&#10;will, sir!  I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--'&#10;&#10;'So what?' inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.&#10;&#10;'So lonely, sir!  So very lonely!' cried the child.  'Everybody hates&#10;me.  Oh! sir, don't, don't pray be cross to me!'  The child beat his&#10;hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion's face, with tears of&#10;real agony.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some&#10;astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky&#10;manner; and after muttering something about 'that troublesome cough,'&#10;bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his&#10;hand, he walked on with him in silence.&#10;&#10;The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was&#10;making some entries in his day-" />
    <node id="When Oliver begs not to be sent away with Mr. Bumble, the magistrates show uncharacteristic kindness. Instead of sending him back to the workhouse, they tell Mr. Bumble to treat him kindly as he seems to need it. This takes Mr. Bumble, who is not used to being spoken to in such a manner, by complete surprise. He is &quot;stupefied with astonishment&quot; and can only repeat his question of whether the gentleman had indeed spoken to him. The magistrates' treatment of Oliver represents a moral revolution, as they prioritize his well-being over the rules.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble's reaction to being told to hold his tongue by one of the gentlemen is similarly stunned silence. He had never been treated in such a way before and struggles to comprehend it. The narrator notes that &quot;A beadle ordered to hold his tongue! A moral revolution!&quot; indicating the significant change in how Mr. Bumble is being treated. This moment marks a turning point for Mr. Bumble, who is no longer able to wield the same amount of power and authority as he once did." />

A moral revolution!&#10;&#10;The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his&#10;companion, he nodded significantly.&#10;&#10;'We refuse to sanction these indentures,' said the old gentleman:&#10;tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.&#10;&#10;'I hope,' stammered Mr. Limbkins:  'I hope the magistrates will not&#10;form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper&#10;conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.'&#10;&#10;'The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the&#10;matter,' said the second old gentleman sharply.  'Take the boy back to&#10;the workhouse, and treat him kindly.  He seems to want it.'&#10;&#10;That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively&#10;and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he&#10;would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his&#10;head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good;&#10;whereunto Mr. Gamfield" />
    <node id=" said the other magistrate:&#10;laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of&#10;interest.  'Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid.'&#10;&#10;Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that&#10;they would order him back to the dark room--that they would starve&#10;him--beat him--kill him if they pleased--rather than send him away with&#10;that dreadful man.&#10;&#10;'Well!' said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most&#10;impressive solemnity.  'Well! of all the artful and designing orphans&#10;that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.'&#10;&#10;'Hold your tongue, Beadle,' said the second old gentleman, when Mr.&#10;Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.&#10;&#10;'I beg your worship's pardon,' said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having&#10;heard aright.  'Did your worship speak to me?'&#10;&#10;'Yes.  Hold your tongue.'&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.  A beadle ordered to hold&#10;his tongue!  A moral revolution" />

At&#10;the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned&#10;with the cocked hat, and said aloud:&#10;&#10;'Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.'  As Mr. Bumble said&#10;this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice,&#10;'Mind what I told you, you young rascal!'&#10;&#10;Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this somewhat&#10;contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his&#10;offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining&#10;room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great&#10;window.

'Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer&#10;me distinctly.  Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had&#10;eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?'&#10;&#10;'He did, sir,' replied Bumble.&#10;&#10;'That boy will be hung,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  'I&#10;know that boy will be hung.'&#10;&#10;Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion.  An animated&#10;discussion took place.

To these&#10;interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for&#10;the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had&#10;by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.&#10;&#10;Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an&#10;hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of&#10;bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old&#10;woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him&#10;that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.&#10;&#10;Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,&#10;Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite&#10;certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.

    <node id="The elderly female in the narrative demonstrates an approach to &quot;experimental philosophy&quot; similar to that of the philosopher with his horse by prioritizing her own needs over those of the children under her care. She appropriates the greater part of the weekly stipend for herself, leaving a smaller allowance for the children, which she believes is still sufficient for their needs. This is reminiscent of the philosopher's theory that a horse can live without eating, as he gradually reduces his horse's food intake to a minimum. Both the elderly female and the philosopher are conducting &quot;experiments&quot; to test their theories, with potentially harmful consequences for those under their care." />

With this view, they contracted with the&#10;water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a&#10;corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and&#10;issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and&#10;half a roll of Sundays.  They made a great many other wise and humane&#10;regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary&#10;to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in&#10;consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors' Commons; and,&#10;instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had&#10;theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a&#10;bachelor!

The workhouse authorities replied with&#10;humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities&#10;magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,'&#10;or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse&#10;some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders&#10;against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the&#10;inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental&#10;superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and&#10;for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.&#10;Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child;&#10;a great deal may be" />

'It's Meat.'&#10;&#10;'What?' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.&#10;&#10;'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. 'You've&#10;over-fed him, ma'am.

Of&#10;which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or&#10;deed.&#10;&#10;'Ah!' said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth&#10;again; 'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to&#10;leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little starved&#10;down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the&#10;apprenticeship.

As the&#10;young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with&#10;more kindness than might have been expected of him:&#10;&#10;'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'&#10;&#10;'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily&#10;depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which&#10;she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.&#10;&#10;'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,&#10;and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two,&#10;and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in&#10;that way, bless her dear heart!

The purpose of Mr. Sowerberry's professional mission with Oliver is to have him serve as a &quot;mute&quot; for children's funerals, standing silently and solemnly during the procession and ceremony.

Based on their observations, we can infer that the area they are traveling through is not wealthy or upscale. The passage mentions that they pass by old-clothes shops, slop-shops, and second-hand dealers; and later, chimney-sweepers, ballad-singers, and flower-girls. These details suggest a lower socioeconomic status for the area. Additionally, Mr. Sowerberry's profession as an undertaker catering to children's funerals also implies a community with limited financial resources." />

The more the case presented itself to the board, in&#10;this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step&#10;appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of&#10;providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,&#10;with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a&#10;cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to&#10;communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate,&#10;no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit&#10;of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,&#10;and shoes to answer.

Meanwhile, Mr. Gamfield, a chimney-sweep, is struggling to pay off his overdue rent. As he is deeply cogitating on how to acquire the necessary funds, his eyes encounter a bill hanging on the workhouse gate.

But the&#10;magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn't reasonably&#10;be expected to discern what other people did.&#10;&#10;'I hope I am, sir,' said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.&#10;&#10;'I have no doubt you are, my friend,' replied the old gentleman: fixing&#10;his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the&#10;inkstand.&#10;&#10;It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate.  If the inkstand had been&#10;where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen&#10;into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been&#10;straightway hurried off.

He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic&#10;performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin&#10;of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of&#10;bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:&#10;thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill&#10;him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten&#10;him up in that way.&#10;&#10;'Don't" />
    <node id="The old woman, upon learning that her daughter had just died, had a rather unusual reaction.

She silenced the crying children with threats and menaced them into silence. When the undertaker attempted to leave, she stopped him and made several demands, such as asking for a cloak and some bread. Despite the somber atmosphere, the old woman seemed more concerned with her own needs and comfort than showing any emotional response to her daughter's death." />

Having unloosened the cravat of the&#10;man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the&#10;undertaker.&#10;&#10;'She was my daughter,' said the old woman, nodding her head in the&#10;direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more&#10;ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. 'Lord, Lord!&#10;Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman&#10;then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and&#10;stiff!  Lord, Lord!--to think of it; it's as good as a play--as good as&#10;a play!'&#10;&#10;As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,&#10;the undertaker turned to go away.&#10;&#10;'Stop, stop!' said the old woman in a loud whisper" />
    <node id=" he rapped at it with his knuckles.&#10;&#10;It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.  The undertaker&#10;at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the&#10;apartment to which he had been directed.  He stepped in; Oliver&#10;followed him.&#10;&#10;There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,&#10;over the empty stove.  An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the&#10;cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged&#10;children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,&#10;there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.&#10;Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept&#10;involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the&#10;boy felt that it was a corpse.&#10;&#10;The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;&#10;his eyes were bloodshot.  The old woman's face was wrinkled; her two&#10;remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright&#10;and piercing.  Oliver was afraid" />

'Will she be&#10;buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?  I laid her out; and I must&#10;walk, you know.  Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is&#10;bitter cold.  We should have cake and wine, too, before we go!  Never&#10;mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.  Shall&#10;we have some bread, dear?' she said eagerly: catching at the&#10;undertaker's coat, as he once more moved towards the door.&#10;&#10;'Yes, yes,' said the undertaker,'of course.  Anything you like!' He&#10;disengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing Oliver&#10;after him, hurried away.&#10;&#10;The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a&#10;half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble&#10;himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where&#10;Mr. Bumble" />

I begged&#10;for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,&#10;she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they&#10;starved her to death.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, it appears that both Oliver Twist and those around him have different reactions to loss and hardship. When it comes to death, the characters' responses vary greatly. Oliver is visibly upset when his mother is mentioned, showing genuine grief for his lost loved one. In contrast, Noah Claypole speaks of the deaths of others in a mocking tone, revealing a lack of empathy and compassion towards the deceased.&#10;&#10;In terms of daily life at the workhouse, it's clear that the system is designed to treat the children harshly and dehumanize them. When Oliver is wrapped in a blanket, he could be mistaken for a child of any social status, but once he's dressed in the &quot;calico robes&quot; of the workhouse, he's immediately branded as an orphan and a parish child, subject to mistreatment and disrespect. The other children at the workhouse are described as &quot;juvenile offenders against the poor-laws,&quot; which further stigmatizes them and reinforces their status as outsiders.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the passage mentions that Oliver was brought up &quot;by hand,&quot; indicating a lack of proper care and attention. The fact that he was farmed out to a branch workhouse for sevenpence-halfpenny per week suggests that the authorities prioritize cost over the well-being of the children in their care.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that both Oliver and those around him are affected by loss and hardship in different ways. While some characters, like Oliver, show genuine emotion and compassion, others, like Noah, lack empathy and treat those who have suffered loss with disrespect and cruelty. Meanwhile, the workhouse system itself is designed to dehumanize and mistreat the children in its care, reinforcing their status as outsiders and making it difficult for them to escape poverty and hardship." />

Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only&#10;covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it&#10;would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him&#10;his proper station in society.  But now that he was enveloped in the&#10;old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was&#10;badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish&#10;child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to&#10;be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied&#10;by none.&#10;&#10;Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan,&#10;left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he&#10;would have cried the louder.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic&#10;course of treachery and deception.  He was brought up by hand.  The&#10;hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported&#10;by the workhouse authorities to the" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it's not explicitly stated how Oliver Twist responded to witnessing the calm acceptance of loss and ill-treatment around him. However, it is mentioned that he continued to submit to Noah Claypole's mistreatment for many months after their initial encounter, even though he was promoted while Oliver remained in his previous position. This suggests that Oliver may have felt powerless or resigned to his circumstances, possibly due to the harsh and dehumanizing environment of the workhouse. It's also worth noting that Oliver shows genuine grief for his lost mother, indicating that he is capable of emotional depth and sensitivity. Overall, while the narrative doesn't provide a direct answer to how Oliver responded to witnessing calm acceptance of loss and ill-treatment, it does suggest that he may have felt overwhelmed or powerless in the face of such adversity." />
    <node id="Oliver's inability to hold back his tears in front of Mr. Bumble is due to a combination of factors, including his hunger and recent ill-treatment, separation from the familiar, intimidation by Mr. Bumble, pity and empathy from Mr. Bumble, and fear and anxiety about the unknown. These factors make it difficult for Oliver to control his emotions, leading him to cry despite his efforts.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble reacts with anger towards Oliver's emotional display because he perceives it as ungratefulness and disobedience, especially since he had warned Oliver not to cry. Mr. Bumble is a stern figure who is used to wielding authority, and he becomes enraged when his instructions are not followed or when his power is challenged in any way. Additionally, Mr. Bumble may feel embarrassed by Oliver's tears, as they suggest that the boy is not intimidated by him, which further fuels his anger.&#10;&#10;The fact that Oliver's emotional display causes a &quot;moral revolution&quot; among the magistrates and leads to a turning point for Mr. Bumble highlights the power of empathy and kindness in challenging oppressive systems and individuals. It also underscores the dehumanizing effects of poverty, neglect, and abuse on children like Oliver, who are forced to endure harsh conditions from a young age." />
    <node id="In the given narrative, it was Mr. Bumble, the beadle of the parish workhouse, who came up with the name &quot;Twist&quot; for the foundling boy. The method used for naming children at the parish is to name them in alphabetical order.

But these impertinences were speedily checked by the&#10;evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of&#10;whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was&#10;very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever&#10;the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.  Besides, the board&#10;made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the&#10;day before, to say they were going.  The children were neat and clean&#10;to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!&#10;&#10;It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any&#10;very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.  Oliver Twist's ninth birthday&#10;found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and&#10;decidedly small in circumference.  But nature or inheritance had&#10;implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast. " />

There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under&#10;these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,&#10;if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were&#10;long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.  The relief was&#10;inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened&#10;people.&#10;&#10;For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was&#10;in full operation.  It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of&#10;the increase in the undertaker's bill, and the necessity of taking in&#10;the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their&#10;wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two's gruel.  But the number of&#10;workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were&#10;in ecstasies.&#10;&#10;The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a&#10;copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the&#10;purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at&#10;" />
    <node id="At the time when Mr. Gamfield, the chimney-sweep, was contemplating how to pay his overdue rent, Oliver Twist was in an &quot;auspicious and comfortable state&quot; after being set apart in the workhouse due to fears of his sinful influences. However, the board did not approve of Mr. Gamfield's proposition to take Oliver as an apprentice, possibly due to the imputation that he had bruised three or four boys to death already.&#10;&#10;Mr. Gamfield's encounter with a workhouse bill affected this situation when he saw it as an opportunity to gain an apprentice and pay off his debt at the same time. The bill contained information about Oliver Twist's circumstances, and Mr. Gamfield noticed that taking him as an apprentice would cost five pounds, which was the exact amount he needed to pay his overdue rent. Therefore, this encounter led to a change in Mr. Gamfield's plans for acquiring funds and ultimately to the board's decision regarding Oliver Twist's apprenticeship." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Oliver Twist doesn't necessarily demonstrate courage when he asks for more food at the workhouse. Rather, he is described as being driven by extreme hunger to take the unprecedented step of asking for seconds during dinner. This action goes against the strict rules and harsh environment of the workhouse, where the boys are given only a small portion of gruel to eat each day.&#10;&#10;When Oliver asks for more food, the entire group of boys is shocked and silent, highlighting the bravery of no one else daring to make such a request before. The workhouse officials, including Mr. Bumble and the parish beadle, are outraged by Oliver's audacity and view it as a direct challenge to their authority.&#10;&#10;As a result, Oliver is subjected to severe punishment, including being whipped and forced to work for longer hours without any additional food or rest. The authorities also decide to put him up for auction as an apprentice to the highest bidder, in order to get rid of him and prevent any further disruptions to their strict regime.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Oliver's request for more food may not be seen as an act of courage, it does demonstrate his resilience and determination to survive in a difficult and oppressive environment. However, it also brings about harsher treatment from the workhouse officials and ultimately leads to his being sent away as an apprentice." />
    <node id="The fortunate circumstance of Oliver Twist being born in a workhouse lies in the fact that there were no careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, or doctors present at his birth. According to the narrative, such individuals would have likely intervened and tried to save Oliver, but their efforts might have unintentionally caused his death due to their lack of knowledge about his specific needs. The workhouse's pauper old woman and parish surgeon were not overly concerned with Oliver's well-being, which ultimately allowed him the opportunity to survive despite his initial difficulties in breathing.&#10;&#10;Moreover, being born in a workhouse established Oliver's status as a parish child and orphan from the start, which determined his place in society. While this position was not desirable, it set the stage for the events that followed in the narrative, ultimately leading to Oliver's journey of self-discovery and growth." />

The fact is, that there was considerable&#10;difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of&#10;respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered&#10;necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a&#10;little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and&#10;the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,&#10;if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful&#10;grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of&#10;profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been&#10;killed in no time.

The result was, that, after&#10;a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise&#10;to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been&#10;imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could&#10;reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been&#10;possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer&#10;space of time than three minutes and a quarter.&#10;&#10;As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his&#10;lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron&#10;bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly&#10;from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,&#10;'Let me see the child, and die.'&#10;&#10;The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:&#10;giving the palms of his hands a warm and a" />
    <node id="In this passage, Oliver Twist angrily confronts Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry after they imply that his mother was a morally corrupt person. He stands up for his mother's character, which leads to Mrs. Sowerberry bursting into tears. As a result, Mr. Sowerberry feels obligated to punish Oliver most severely to maintain his standing in the marriage.&#10;&#10;After the confrontation with the Sowerberrys, Oliver is taken to the undertaker's shop by Mr. Bumble. There, he meets the undertaker and his wife. When Mr. Sowerberry mentions Oliver's &quot;melancholy&quot; expression, Mrs. Sowerberry expresses her wonderment, and Mr. Sowerberry proposes the idea of having Oliver serve as a mute for children's funerals. This would be a new role for him, and it would create a superb effect during funeral processions and ceremonies. Although Mrs. Sowerberry initially has some concerns about her dignity being compromised by openly agreeing to this suggestion, she ultimately approves of the idea.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Oliver's confrontation with the Sowerberrys leads to some immediate tension, it does not significantly impact his situation in the short term. However, it is clear that Mrs. Sowerberry has mixed feelings about taking on another child, which may affect Oliver's treatment in the long run." />
    <node id="1. Hunger and recent ill-treatment: Oliver is hungry and has recently been ill-treated, which makes it easy for him to cry. As they walk, Mr. Bumble notices that Oliver is crying into his gruel and tells him to stop, clean his eyes with his jacket cuffs, and look happy.&#10;2. Separation from the familiar: Leaving the only home he has ever known and the people he considers his friends, however wretched they may be, brings about a sense of loneliness and fear in Oliver, contributing to his overwhelming emotion. Mr. Bumble tries to alleviate this by telling him that all he needs to do is look happy and say he wants to be apprenticed when asked.&#10;3. Fear and anxiety about the unknown: Being in an unfamiliar situation with new people adds to Oliver's fear and inability to control his emotions. Mr. Bumble leads him to the magistrate's office, where they will decide his future.&#10;4. Mr. Bumble's instructions to Oliver are to look happy and agree to being apprenticed when asked. He also warns Oliver that if he fails to do so, there may be consequences." />

As&#10;they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it&#10;expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for&#10;inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and&#10;becoming air of gracious patronage.&#10;&#10;'Oliver!'  said Mr. Bumble.&#10;&#10;'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.&#10;&#10;'Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head," />
    <node id="In the narrative of Oliver Twist, the name &quot;Twist&quot; for the foundling boy was given by Mr. Bumble, the beadle of the parish workhouse. The reason they follow an alphabetical order in naming the children at the workhouse is to systematically name newborns in consecutive order; for instance, the last child was named Swubble (S), followed by Twist (T), and the next ones will be Unwin (U) and Vilkins (V). This pattern continues up to the end of the alphabet." />
    <node id="At the time in question, Oliver Twist's affairs were in an auspicious and comfortable state after he was set apart in the workhouse due to fears of his sinful influences. Meanwhile, Mr. Gamfield, the chimney-sweep, was struggling to pay off his overdue rent. As he pondered how to acquire the necessary funds, he encountered a bill hanging on the workhouse gate that contained information about Oliver Twist's circumstances. Seeing this as an opportunity to gain an apprentice and pay off his debt at the same time, Mr. Gamfield approached the board with a proposition to take Oliver as an apprentice, which they ultimately declined due to concerns about his character. The bill that Mr. Gamfield encountered had details of Oliver Twist's circumstances, including his separation from other boys in the workhouse and the special supplications made for him to be protected from his sinnful influences." />

Mrs. Sowerberry reacts to this suggestion with initial concerns about her dignity being compromised if she openly agrees to having Oliver serve as a mute.

She may also be hesitant to take on another child, as they already have Charlotte and Noah in their care." />
    <node id="Mr. Gamfield, the chimney-sweep, is trying to get Oliver appointed as an apprentice primarily to serve his own needs, which are to gain a new apprentice and pay off his overdue rent at the same time. He encounters a bill on the workhouse gate that contains information about Oliver Twist's circumstances and notices that taking him as an apprentice would cost five pounds, which is the exact amount he needs to pay his debt.&#10;&#10;However, it is worth noting that the trade of chimney-sweeping is indeed dangerous and has caused harm to young boys in the past. Mr. Gamfield &quot;labours under the slight imputation&quot; of having bruised three or four boys to death already. This fact might have affected the board's decision regarding Oliver Twist's apprenticeship, as they did not approve of his proposition. Nonetheless, Mr. Gamfield's primary motivation is to solve his financial problems rather than consider the welfare of the child he seeks to apprentice." />
    <node id="Mr. Bumble suddenly pays attention to Oliver's appearance as they approach Sowerberry's shop because he wants to ensure that Oliver is presentable and ready for inspection by his new master. This demonstrates that Mr. Bumble is aware of the importance of first impressions and wishes to make sure that Oliver appears well-maintained, which might increase his chances of being accepted by the Sowerberrys. Additionally, this could also be a power dynamic, as Mr. Bumble, in his role as a parish beadle, takes pleasure in exerting his authority and making sure everything is in order before presenting Oliver to the new establishment." />

Noah's mother is a washerwoman, and his father is a drunken soldier with a wooden leg and a small pension. The shop-boys in the neighborhood often brand him with derogatory epithets such as 'leathers' and 'charity.' In contrast, Oliver has no known family or connections, and he is subjected to mistreatment and poverty in the workhouse.&#10;&#10;Noah comes from a background of poverty and hardship, but he has parents who are alive and present in his life, whereas Oliver's parents are dead, and he is left alone in the world. Additionally, Noah's experiences with mockery and bullying have made him insensitive to the feelings and emotions of others, as evidenced by his callous behavior towards Oliver after bringing up his mother's death.&#10;&#10;In summary, Noah and Oliver come from different backgrounds, with Noah having a more stable family situation compared to Oliver's complete lack of known family or connections. These differences in their backgrounds shape how they view the world and interact with those around them, particularly in response to loss and adversity." />
    <node id="The board's proposed solution for handling Oliver Twist was to send him to sea as a cabin-boy without any friends. The reason behind this decision was their view of Mr. Gamfield, the chimney-sweep, who wanted to take Oliver as an apprentice. The board considered that sending Oliver to sea would be a more effective way of providing for him, as they had concerns about Mr. Gamfield's character and his reputation for being physically abusive. The narrative mentions that Mr. Gamfield had &quot;laboured under the slight imputation&quot; of having bruised three or four boys to death already, which might have affected the board's decision. Therefore, the board saw sending Oliver to sea as a safer and more suitable option for his upbringing and protection from potential harm." />

Through these experiences, Oliver became skilled in conducting funeral processions and ceremonies, which helped Mr. Sowerberry's business flourish during this season.

It was a nice&#10;sickly season just at this time.  In commercial phrase, coffins were&#10;looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great&#10;deal of experience.  The success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious&#10;speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes.

When it comes to death, the characters' responses vary greatly. Oliver is visibly upset when his mother is mentioned, showing genuine grief for his lost loved one. In contrast, Noah Claypole speaks of the deaths of others in a mocking tone, revealing a lack of empathy and compassion towards the deceased.&#10;&#10;In terms of daily life at the workhouse, it's clear that the system is designed to treat the children harshly and dehumanize them. When Oliver is wrapped in a blanket, he could be mistaken for a child of any social status, but once he's dressed in the &quot;calico robes&quot; of the workhouse, he's immediately branded as an orphan and a parish child, subject to mistreatment and disrespect. The other children at the workhouse are described as &quot;juvenile offenders against the poor-laws,&quot; which further stigmatizes them and reinforces their status as outsiders.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the passage mentions that Oliver was brought up &quot;by hand,&quot; indicating a lack of proper care and attention. The fact that he was farmed out to a branch workhouse for sevenpence-halfpenny per week suggests that the authorities prioritize cost over the well-being of the children in their care.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that both Oliver and those around him are affected by loss and hardship in different ways. While some characters, like Oliver, show genuine emotion and compassion, others, like Noah, lack empathy and treat those who have suffered loss with disrespect and cruelty. Meanwhile, the workhouse system itself is designed to dehumanize and mistreat the children in its care, reinforcing their status as outsiders and making it difficult for them to escape poverty and hardship.">

The workhouse's pauper old woman and parish surgeon were not overly concerned with Oliver's well-being, which ultimately allowed him the opportunity to survive despite his initial difficulties in breathing.&#10;&#10;Moreover, being born in a workhouse established Oliver's status as a parish child and orphan from the start, which determined his place in society.

When it comes to death, the characters' responses vary greatly. Oliver is visibly upset when his mother is mentioned, showing genuine grief for his lost loved one. In contrast, Noah Claypole speaks of the deaths of others in a mocking tone, revealing a lack of empathy and compassion towards the deceased.&#10;&#10;In terms of daily life at the workhouse, it's clear that the system is designed to treat the children harshly and dehumanize them. When Oliver is wrapped in a blanket, he could be mistaken for a child of any social status, but once he's dressed in the &quot;calico robes&quot; of the workhouse, he's immediately branded as an orphan and a parish child, subject to mistreatment and disrespect. The other children at the workhouse are described as &quot;juvenile offenders against the poor-laws,&quot; which further stigmatizes them and reinforces their status as outsiders.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the passage mentions that Oliver was brought up &quot;by hand,&quot; indicating a lack of proper care and attention. The fact that he was farmed out to a branch workhouse for sevenpence-halfpenny per week suggests that the authorities prioritize cost over the well-being of the children in their care.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that both Oliver and those around him are affected by loss and hardship in different ways. While some characters, like Oliver, show genuine emotion and compassion, others, like Noah, lack empathy and treat those who have suffered loss with disrespect and cruelty. Meanwhile, the workhouse system itself is designed to dehumanize and mistreat the children in its care, reinforcing their status as outsiders and making it difficult for them to escape poverty and hardship.">

The other children at the workhouse are described as &quot;juvenile offenders against the poor-laws,&quot; which further stigmatizes them and reinforces their status as outsiders.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the passage mentions that Oliver was brought up &quot;by hand,&quot; indicating a lack of proper care and attention.

While some characters, like Oliver, show genuine emotion and compassion, others, like Noah, lack empathy and treat those who have suffered loss with disrespect and cruelty. Meanwhile, the workhouse system itself is designed to dehumanize and mistreat the children in its care, reinforcing their status as outsiders and making it difficult for them to escape poverty and hardship.">

When it comes to death, the characters' responses vary greatly. Oliver is visibly upset when his mother is mentioned, showing genuine grief for his lost loved one. In contrast, Noah Claypole speaks of the deaths of others in a mocking tone, revealing a lack of empathy and compassion towards the deceased.&#10;&#10;In terms of daily life at the workhouse, it's clear that the system is designed to treat the children harshly and dehumanize them. When Oliver is wrapped in a blanket, he could be mistaken for a child of any social status, but once he's dressed in the &quot;calico robes&quot; of the workhouse, he's immediately branded as an orphan and a parish child, subject to mistreatment and disrespect. The other children at the workhouse are described as &quot;juvenile offenders against the poor-laws,&quot; which further stigmatizes them and reinforces their status as outsiders.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the passage mentions that Oliver was brought up &quot;by hand,&quot; indicating a lack of proper care and attention. The fact that he was farmed out to a branch workhouse for sevenpence-halfpenny per week suggests that the authorities prioritize cost over the well-being of the children in their care.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that both Oliver and those around him are affected by loss and hardship in different ways. While some characters, like Oliver, show genuine emotion and compassion, others, like Noah, lack empathy and treat those who have suffered loss with disrespect and cruelty. Meanwhile, the workhouse system itself is designed to dehumanize and mistreat the children in its care, reinforcing their status as outsiders and making it difficult for them to escape poverty and hardship.">

This would be a new role for him, and it would create a superb effect during funeral processions and ceremonies. Although Mrs. Sowerberry initially has some concerns about her dignity being compromised by openly agreeing to this suggestion, she ultimately approves of the idea.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Oliver's confrontation with the Sowerberrys leads to some immediate tension, it does not significantly impact his situation in the short term. However, it is clear that Mrs. Sowerberry has mixed feelings about taking on another child, which may affect Oliver's treatment in the long run." target="During the sickly season, Oliver Twist had many experiences that contributed to the success of Mr. Sowerberry's funeral business. As a result of a high prevalence of measles and its fatal impact on infant existence, there were numerous mournful processions in which little Oliver led the way. Wearing a hat-band reaching down to his knees, Oliver made an impression on all the mothers in town, creating admiration and emotion. Through these experiences, Oliver became skilled in conducting funeral processions and ceremonies, which helped Mr. Sowerberry's business flourish during this season. The increased demand for coffins allowed Mr. Sowerberry to benefit from his speculation in children's funerals.">

Noah's mother is a washerwoman, and his father is a drunken soldier with a wooden leg and a small pension. The shop-boys in the neighborhood often brand him with derogatory epithets such as 'leathers' and 'charity.' In contrast, Oliver has no known family or connections, and he is subjected to mistreatment and poverty in the workhouse.&#10;&#10;Noah comes from a background of poverty and hardship, but he has parents who are alive and present in his life, whereas Oliver's parents are dead, and he is left alone in the world.

These differences in their backgrounds shape how they view the world and interact with those around them, particularly in response to loss and adversity.">

    <node id=" wrong, but which may be right. If I saw&#10;the moccasin, howsever, I could tell, in a minute, whether it is made in&#10;the Delaware fashion, or not.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Here it is, then,&quot; said the quick-witted Judith, who had already gone&#10;to the canoe in quest of it. &quot;Tell us what it says; friend or enemy. You&#10;look honest, and I believe all you say, whatever father may think.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the way with you, Jude; forever finding out friends, where I&#10;distrust foes,&quot; grumbled Tom: &quot;but, speak out, young man, and tell us&#10;what you think of the moccasin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's not Delaware made,&quot; returned Deerslayer, examining the worn and&#10;rejected covering for the foot with a cautious eye. &quot;I'm too young on a&#10;war-path to be positive, but I should say that moccasin has a northern&#10;look, and comes from beyond the Great Lakes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If such is the case, we ought not to lie here a minute longer than is&#10;necessary,&quot; said Hutter, glancing through the leaves of his cover, as if&#10;he" />

For that&#10;matter, I found the spot where he halted to make a new one, which was&#10;only a few yards from the place where he had dropped the old one.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That doesn't look much like a red-skin on the war path!&quot; returned the&#10;other, shaking his head. &quot;An exper'enced warrior, at least, would have&#10;burned, or buried, or sunk in the river such signs of his passage; and&#10;your trail is, quite likely, a peaceable trail. But the moccasin may&#10;greatly relieve my mind, if you bethought you of bringing it off. I've&#10;come here to meet a young chief myself; and his course would be much in&#10;the direction you've mentioned. The trail may have been his'n.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hurry Harry, you're well acquainted with this young man, I hope, who&#10;has meetings with savages in a part of the country where he has&#10;never been before?&quot; demanded Hutter, in a tone and in a manner" />
    <node id=" was too light for the other. Put your paddle in the&#10;water, and send the canoe in, to that log; I'll land and cut off the&#10;creatur's retreat up the p'int, be it a Mingo, or be it a muskrat.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Hurry complied, Deerslayer was soon on the shore, advancing into the&#10;thicket with a moccasined foot, and a caution that prevented the least&#10;noise. In a minute he was in the centre of the narrow strip of land,&#10;and moving slowly down towards its end, the bushes rendering extreme&#10;watchfulness necessary. Just as he reached the centre of the thicket&#10;the dried twigs cracked again, and the noise was repeated at short&#10;intervals, as if some creature having life walked slowly towards the&#10;point. Hurry heard these sounds also, and pushing the canoe off into&#10;the bay, he seized his rifle to watch the result. A breathless minute&#10;succeeded, after which a noble buck walked out of the thicket, proceeded&#10;with a stately step to the sandy extremity of the point, and began to&#10;slake his thirst from the water of the lake. Hurry hesitated an" />
    <node id="ps!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think as you do, Hurry, and wish, with all my heart, we lay anywhere&#10;else, at this moment, than in this narrow, crooked stream, which has&#10;many advantages to hide in, but which is almost fatal to them that are&#10;discovered. The savages are near us, moreover, and the difficulty is,&#10;to get out of the river without being shot down like deer standing at a&#10;lick!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you sartain, Master Hutter, that the red-skins you dread are ra'al&#10;Canadas?&quot; asked Deerslayer, in a modest but earnest manner. &quot;Have you&#10;seen any, and can you describe their paint?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have fallen in with the signs of their being in the neighborhood,&#10;but have seen none of 'em. I was down stream a mile or so, looking to my&#10;traps, when I struck a fresh trail, crossing the corner of a swamp, and&#10;moving northward. The man had not passed an hour; and I know'd it for an&#10;Indian footstep, by the size of the foot, and the intoe, even before I&#10;found a worn moccasin," />
    <node id="?&quot; asked Deerslayer; &quot;I see no opening in the&#10;banks or the trees, that looks as if it would let a river like the&#10;Susquehannah run through it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, Deerslayer, rivers are like human mortals; having small beginnings,&#10;and ending with broad shoulders and wide mouths. You don't see the&#10;outlet, because it passes atween high, steep banks; and the pines, and&#10;hemlocks and bass-woods hang over it, as a roof hangs over a house. If&#10;old Tom is not in the 'Rat's Cove,' he must have burrowed in the river;&#10;we'll look for him first in the cove, and then we'll cross to the&#10;outlet.&quot;&#10;&#10;As they proceeded, Hurry explained that there was a shallow bay, formed&#10;by a long, low point, that had got the name of the &quot;Rat's Cove,&quot; from&#10;the circumstance of its being a favorite haunt of the muskrat; and which&#10;offered so complete a cover for the &quot;ark,&quot; that its owner was fond of&#10;lying in it, whenever he found it convenient.&#10;&#10;&quot;As a man never knows who may be his visitors," />
    <node id="&#10;in particular being subjected to a closer inquiry than the rest of the&#10;wooded boundary.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis as I thought,&quot; said Hurry, laying aside the glass, &quot;the old fellow&#10;is drifting about the south end this fine weather, and has left the&#10;castle to defend itself. Well, now we know that he is not up this-a-way,&#10;'twill be but a small matter to paddle down and hunt him up in his&#10;hiding-place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Does Master Hutter think it necessary to burrow on this lake?&quot; inquired&#10;Deerslayer, as he followed his companion into the canoe; &quot;to my eye it&#10;is such a solitude as one might open his whole soul in, and fear no one&#10;to disarrange his thoughts or his worship.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You forget your friends the Mingos, and all the French savages. Is&#10;there a spot on 'arth, Deerslayer, to which them disquiet rogues don't&#10;go? Where is the lake, or even the deer lick, that the blackguards don't&#10;find out, and having found out, don't, sooner or later, discolour its&#10;water with blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I" />
    <node id="The place that they've entered is a narrow stream with sufficient depth of limpid water and a strong current, surrounded by a canopy of leaves upheld by arches composed of hoary trees. Hurry believes that this is the location where Old Tom has hidden his boat, or &quot;ark,&quot; because it is a favorite haunt of muskrats, offering complete cover for a vessel. The &quot;Rat's Cove&quot; is secluded and invisible from most directions, making it an ideal hiding place. Additionally, Hurry knows that the river begins in this area, and he thinks Old Tom might have taken to trapping and could be hiding further down the river." />
    <node id="&#10;from the lake, the whole presenting the same connected and seemingly&#10;interminable carpet of leaves. As the canoe slowly advanced, sucked in&#10;by the current, it entered beneath an arch of trees, through which the&#10;light from the heavens struggled by casual openings, faintly relieving&#10;the gloom beneath.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a nat'ral and-bush,&quot; half whispered Hurry, as if he felt that&#10;the place was devoted to secrecy and watchfulness; &quot;depend on it, old&#10;Tom has burrowed with the ark somewhere in this quarter. We will drop&#10;down with the current a short distance, and ferret him out.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This seems no place for a vessel of any size,&quot; returned the other; &quot;it&#10;appears to me that we shall have hardly room enough for the canoe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hurry laughed at the suggestion, and, as it soon appeared, with reason;&#10;for the fringe of bushes immediately on the shore of the lake was no&#10;sooner passed, than the adventurers found themselves in a narrow stream,&#10;of a sufficient depth of limpid water, with a strong current, and a&#10;canopy of leaves upheld by arches composed of the limbs of hoary trees." />
    <node id=", could by any possibility be seen from only one direction;&#10;and that was from a densely wooded shore within the sweep of the water,&#10;where strangers would be little apt to go.&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall soon see the ark,&quot; said Hurry, as the canoe glided round&#10;the extremity of the point, where the water was so deep as actually to&#10;appear black; &quot;he loves to burrow up among the rushes, and we shall be&#10;in his nest in five minutes, although the old fellow may be off among&#10;the traps himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;March proved a false prophet. The canoe completely doubled the point, so&#10;as to enable the two travellers to command a view of the whole cove or&#10;bay, for it was more properly the last, and no object, but those that&#10;nature had placed there, became visible. The placid water swept round&#10;in a graceful curve, the rushes bent gently towards its surface, and&#10;the trees overhung it as usual; but all lay in the soothing and sublime&#10;solitude of a wilderness. The scene was such as a poet or an artist&#10;would have delighted in, but it had no charm for Hurry Harry, who was&#10;burning with impatience to" />
    <node id=" Then we are not safe from fire, here, the bark of this roof&#10;being little better than so much kindling-wood. The castle, too, might&#10;be entered and ransacked in my absence, and all my possessions overrun&#10;and destroyed. Once in the lake, we can be attacked only in boats or&#10;on rafts--shall have a fair chance with the enemy--and can protect the&#10;castle with the ark. Do you understand this reasoning, youngster?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It sounds well--yes, it has a rational sound; and I'll not gainsay it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, old Tom,&quot; cried Hurry, &quot;If we are to move, the sooner we make a&#10;beginning, the sooner we shall know whether we are to have our scalps&#10;for night-caps, or not.&quot;&#10;&#10;As this proposition was self-evident, no one denied its justice. The&#10;three men, after a short preliminary explanation, now set about their&#10;preparations to move the ark in earnest. The slight fastenings were&#10;quickly loosened; and, by hauling on the line, the heavy craft slowly&#10;emerged from the cover. It was no sooner free from the inc" />
    <node id=" as to&#10;conceal any little variations from its general outline.&#10;&#10;&quot;I've not been down at this end of the lake these two summers,&quot; said&#10;Hurry, standing up in the canoe, the better to look about him. &quot;Ay,&#10;there's the rock, showing its chin above the water, and I know that the&#10;river begins in its neighborhood.&quot;&#10;&#10;The men now plied the paddles again, and they were presently within a&#10;few yards of the rock, floating towards it, though their efforts were&#10;suspended. This rock was not large, being merely some five or six feet&#10;high, only half of which elevation rose above the lake. The incessant&#10;washing of the water for centuries had so rounded its summit, that it&#10;resembled a large beehive in shape, its form being more than usually&#10;regular and even. Hurry remarked, as they floated slowly past, that this&#10;rock was well known to all the Indians in that part of the country, and&#10;that they were in the practice of using it as a mark to designate the&#10;place of meeting, when separated by their hunts and marches.&#10;&#10;&quot;And here is the river, Deerslayer,&quot; he continued," />
    <node id=" disparity in&#10;natural means.&#10;&#10;Each time the canoe passed a point, Hurry turned a look behind him,&#10;expecting to see the &quot;ark&quot; anchored, or beached in the bay. He was&#10;fated to be disappointed, however; and they had got within a mile of the&#10;southern end of the lake, or a distance of quite two leagues from the&#10;&quot;castle,&quot; which was now hidden from view by half a dozen intervening&#10;projections of the land, when he suddenly ceased paddling, as if&#10;uncertain in what direction next to steer.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is possible that the old chap has dropped into the river,&quot; said&#10;Hurry, after looking carefully along the whole of the eastern shore,&#10;which was about a mile distant, and open to his scrutiny for more than&#10;half its length; &quot;for he has taken to trapping considerable, of late,&#10;and, barring flood-wood, he might drop down it a mile or so; though he&#10;would have a most scratching time in getting back again!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is this outlet?&quot; asked Deerslayer; &quot;I see no opening in the&#10;banks or the trees, that looks as if it would let a river like the&#10;Sus" />
    <node id="Hetty Hutter is a young girl who lives on a lake with her sister Judith. She has a simple mind that is innocent and guileless, with a natural modesty that gives her an unsuspecting purity. Hetty's intellect is somewhat impaired, causing her to lack artful qualities but retain her ingenuousness and love for truth. Deerslayer notices her beauty, which is different from Judith's in that it is more subtle and natural. Hetty is known for her naivete and artlessness, and she loves the truth. She has spent most of her life on the lake since her mother passed away and her father went trapping. Despite being less educated than others, Hetty shows interest in names and their significance, revealing her unique personality traits." />
    <node id=" did not begin to feel a&#10;deep and lasting interest in the girl. She had no colour, in common,&#10;nor was her simple mind apt to present images that caused her cheek to&#10;brighten, though she retained a modesty so innate that it almost raised&#10;her to the unsuspecting purity of a being superior to human infirmities.&#10;Guileless, innocent, and without distrust, equally by nature and from&#10;her mode of life, providence had, nevertheless shielded her from harm,&#10;by a halo of moral light, as it is said 'to temper the wind to the shorn&#10;lamb.'&#10;&#10;&quot;You are Hetty Hutter,&quot; said Deerslayer, in the way one puts a question&#10;unconsciously to himself, assuming a kindness of tone and manner that&#10;were singularly adapted to win the confidence of her he addressed.&#10;&quot;Hurry Harry has told me of you, and I know you must be the child?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I'm Hetty Hutter&quot; returned the girl in a low, sweet voice, which&#10;nature, aided by some education, had preserved from vulgarity of tone&#10;and utterance--&quot;I'm Hetty; Judith Hutter's sister;" />
    <node id=" door issued into the end&#10;of the scow opposite to that where he had left Hurry and Judith. Here&#10;he found the other sister, employed at some coarse needle-work, seated&#10;beneath the leafy canopy of the cover.&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer's examination was by this time ended, he dropped the butt&#10;of his rifle, and, leaning on the barrel with both hands, he turned&#10;towards the girl with an interest the singular beauty of her sister&#10;had not awakened. He had gathered from Hurry's remarks that Hetty was&#10;considered to have less intellect than ordinarily falls to the share of&#10;human beings, and his education among Indians had taught him to treat&#10;those who were thus afflicted by Providence with more than common&#10;tenderness. Nor was there any thing in Hetty Hutter's appearance, as so&#10;often happens, to weaken the interest her situation excited. An idiot&#10;she could not properly be termed, her mind being just enough enfeebled&#10;to lose most of those traits that are connected with the more artful&#10;qualities, and to retain its ingenuousness and love of truth. It had&#10;often been remarked of this girl, by the few who had" />
    <node id=" these two daughters of mine give me more&#10;concern than all my traps, and skins, and rights in the country.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's nat'ral!&quot; cried Hurry. &quot;Yes, Deerslayer, you and I don't know it&#10;yet by experience; but, on the whole, I consider that as nat'ral. If we&#10;had darters, it's more than probable we should have some such feelin's;&#10;and I honor the man that owns 'em. As for Judith, old man, I enlist, at&#10;once, as her soldier, and here is Deerslayer to help you to take care of&#10;Hetty.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Many thanks to you, Master March,&quot; returned the beauty, in a full, rich&#10;voice, and with an accuracy of intonation and utterance that she shared&#10;in common with her sister, and which showed that she had been better&#10;taught than her father's life and appearance would give reason to&#10;expect. &quot;Many thanks to you; but Judith Hutter has the spirit and&#10;the experience that will make her depend more on herself than on&#10;good-looking rovers like you. Should there be need to face the savages,&#10;" />
    <node id=" I was named after him, of&#10;course, the given name being Nathaniel, or Natty, as most people saw fit&#10;to tarm it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes--Natty--and Hetty&quot; interrupted the girl quickly, and&#10;looking up from her work again, with a smile: &quot;you are Natty, and I'm&#10;Hetty--though you are Bumppo, and I'm Hutter. Bumppo isn't as pretty as&#10;Hutter, is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, that's as people fancy. Bumppo has no lofty sound, I admit; and&#10;yet men have bumped through the world with it. I did not go by this&#10;name, howsoever, very long; for the Delawares soon found out, or thought&#10;they found out, that I was not given to lying, and they called me,&#10;firstly, 'Straight-tongue.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a good name,&quot; interrupted Hetty, earnestly, and in a positive&#10;manner; &quot;don't tell me there's no virtue in names!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not say that, for perhaps I desarved to be so called, lies being&#10;" />
    <node id=" last name is a&#10;very good one--better than Natty Bumppo.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is nat'ral in one of your turn of mind, Hetty, and much as I&#10;should have expected. They tell me your sister is handsome--oncommon,&#10;for a mortal; and beauty is apt to seek admiration.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you never see Judith?&quot; demanded the girl, with quick earnestness;&#10;&quot;if you never have, go at once and look at her. Even Hurry Harry isn't&#10;more pleasant to look at though she is a woman, and he is a man.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer regarded the girl for a moment with concern. Her pale-face&#10;had flushed a little, and her eye, usually so mild and serene,&#10;brightened as she spoke, in the way to betray the inward impulses.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, Hurry Harry,&quot; he muttered to himself, as he walked through the&#10;cabin towards the other end of the boat; &quot;this comes of good looks, if&#10;a light tongue has had no consarn in it. It's easy to see which way that&#10;poor creatur's feelin's are leanin', whatever may be the case with your&#10;" />
    <node id="nature, aided by some education, had preserved from vulgarity of tone&#10;and utterance--&quot;I'm Hetty; Judith Hutter's sister; and Thomas Hutter's&#10;youngest daughter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know your history, then, for Hurry Harry talks considerable, and he&#10;is free of speech when he can find other people's consarns to dwell on.&#10;You pass most of your life on the lake, Hetty.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly. Mother is dead; father is gone a-trapping, and Judith and I&#10;stay at home. What's your name?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a question more easily asked than it is answered, young woman,&#10;seeing that I'm so young, and yet have borne more names than some of the&#10;greatest chiefs in all America.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you've got a name--you don't throw away one name, before you come&#10;honestly by another?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope not, gal--I hope not. My names have come nat'rally, and I&#10;suppose the one I bear now will be of no great lasting, since the&#10;Delawares seldom settle on a man's ra'al title, until such" />
    <node id="The arrangements made to the cabin and &quot;and-bush&quot; of the ark for security, livability, and concealment on the lake and river were as follows:&#10;&#10;1. The cabin was divided into two apartments, one serving as a parlor and sleeping room for the father, while the other was used by the daughters.&#10;2. A simple kitchen arrangement was made at one end of the scow, open to the air.&#10;3. The &quot;and-bush&quot; or covering of overhanging trees and bushes was used to conceal the ark from enemies. It was anchored under such a cover with branches bent down to dip into the river for security.&#10;4. Stones were fastened to the ends of the branches to make them bend sufficiently, and severed bushes were properly disposed to complete the concealment.&#10;5. The cabin was constructed to resemble a castle but made of light materials, barely bullet-proof.&#10;6. The scow was skillfully put together, being comparatively light for its strength and manageable.&#10;7. Hutter adopted a precaution of dropping heavy stones attached to the line in the center of the stream while descending the river to prevent annoyances and obstacles that would otherwise have attended the short turns of the river. This formed local anchors, each kept from dragging by the assistance of those above it, until the uppermost of all was reached, which got its &quot;backing&quot; from the anchor or grapnel that lay well out in the lake." />
    <node id=" cabin, they soon urged the ark far enough&#10;from the shore to leave no inducement to their enemies to make any&#10;further attempt to injure them.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" for its strength,&#10;and sufficiently manageable. The cabin was divided into two apartments,&#10;one of which served for a parlor, and the sleeping-room of the father,&#10;and the other was appropriated to the uses of the daughters. A very&#10;simple arrangement sufficed for the kitchen, which was in one end of&#10;the scow, and removed from the cabin, standing in the open air; the ark&#10;being altogether a summer habitation.&#10;&#10;The &quot;and-bush,&quot; as Hurry in his ignorance of English termed it, is quite&#10;as easily explained. In many parts of the lake and river, where the&#10;banks were steep and high, the smaller trees and larger bushes, as has&#10;been already mentioned, fairly overhung the stream, their branches not&#10;unfrequently dipping into the water. In some instances they grew out&#10;in nearly horizontal lines, for thirty or forty feet. The water being&#10;uniformly deepest near the shores, where the banks were highest and the&#10;nearest to a perpendicular, Hutter had found no difficulty in letting&#10;the ark drop under one of these covers, where it had been anchored&#10;with a view to conceal its position; security requiring some such&#10;precautions" />
    <node id=" Indian Story,&quot; ii.11-15&#10;&#10;The ark, as the floating habitation of the Hutters was generally called,&#10;was a very simple contrivance. A large flat, or scow, composed the&#10;buoyant part of the vessel; and in its centre, occupying the whole of&#10;its breadth, and about two thirds of its length, stood a low fabric,&#10;resembling the castle in construction, though made of materials so light&#10;as barely to be bullet-proof. As the sides of the scow were a little&#10;higher than usual, and the interior of the cabin had no more elevation&#10;than was necessary for comfort, this unusual addition had neither a very&#10;clumsy nor a very obtrusive appearance. It was, in short, little more&#10;than a modern canal-boat, though more rudely constructed, of greater&#10;breadth than common, and bearing about it the signs of the wilderness,&#10;in its bark-covered posts and roof. The scow, however, had been put&#10;together with some skill, being comparatively light, for its strength,&#10;and sufficiently manageable. The cabin was divided into two apartments,&#10;one of which served for a parlor, and the sleeping-room" />
    <node id="the ark drop under one of these covers, where it had been anchored&#10;with a view to conceal its position; security requiring some such&#10;precautions, in his view of the case. Once beneath the trees and bushes,&#10;a few stones fastened to the ends of the branches had caused them to&#10;bend sufficiently to dip into the river; and a few severed bushes,&#10;properly disposed, did the rest. The reader has seen that this cover was&#10;so complete as to deceive two men accustomed to the woods, and who were&#10;actually in search of those it concealed; a circumstance that will be&#10;easily understood by those who are familiar with the matted and wild&#10;luxuriance of a virgin American forest, more especially in a rich soil.&#10;The discovery of the ark produced very different effects on our two&#10;adventurers.&#10;&#10;As soon as the canoe could be got round to the proper opening, Hurry&#10;leaped on board, and in a minute was closely engaged in a gay, and a&#10;sort of recriminating discourse with Judith, apparently forgetful of&#10;the existence of all the rest of the world. Not so with Deerslayer. He&#10;entered the ark with a" />
    <node id="likely to bestow on one thus introduced, he burst into a hearty fit&#10;of laughter. Deerslayer too well knew the uselessness of attempting&#10;to convince such a being of anything against his prejudices, to feel a&#10;desire to undertake the task; and he was not sorry that the approach of&#10;the canoe to the southeastern curve of the lake gave a new direction to&#10;his ideas. They were now, indeed, quite near the place that March had&#10;pointed out for the position of the outlet, and both began to look for&#10;it with a curiosity that was increased by the expectation of the ark.&#10;&#10;It may strike the reader as a little singular, that the place where a&#10;stream of any size passed through banks that had an elevation of some&#10;twenty feet, should be a matter of doubt with men who could not now have&#10;been more than two hundred yards distant from the precise spot. It will&#10;be recollected, however, that the trees and bushes here, as elsewhere,&#10;fairly overhung the water, making such a fringe to the lake, as to&#10;conceal any little variations from its general outline.&#10;&#10;&quot;I've not been down at this end of the lake these two summers,&quot;" />
    <node id=" withdrawn its&#10;direct rays from the valley; and the hues of evening were beginning to&#10;gather around objects that stood uncovered, rendering those within the&#10;shadows of the woods still more sombre and gloomy.&#10;&#10;No interruption followed the movement, however, and, as the men&#10;continued to haul on the line, the ark passed steadily ahead, the great&#10;breadth of the scow preventing its sinking into the water, and from&#10;offering much resistance to the progress of the swift element beneath&#10;its bottom. Hutter, too, had adopted a precaution suggested by&#10;experience, which might have done credit to a seaman, and which&#10;completely prevented any of the annoyances and obstacles which otherwise&#10;would have attended the short turns of the river. As the ark descended,&#10;heavy stones, attached to the line, were dropped in the centre of the&#10;stream, forming local anchors, each of which was kept from dragging&#10;by the assistance of those above it, until the uppermost of all was&#10;reached, which got its &quot;backing&quot; from the anchor, or grapnel, that lay&#10;well out in the lake.

In Natty's case, he is not born a red-skin and therefore has no right to sit in their councils, and he is also too humble to be called upon for opinions from the great of his own color. Furthermore, this is the first war that has befallen during Natty's time and no enemy has yet reached far enough into the colony for him to make a name for himself through fighting.&#10;&#10;As for sharing names, Natty does tell Hetty his given name, Nathaniel Bumppo, as well as the names that the Delawares have given him: Straight-tongue and Deerslayer. He explains that names can carry virtue, as shown by the fact that he was given the name Straight-tongue because the Delawares found out that he was not given to lying. However, he also mentions that men are often deceived in other men's characters and frequently give them names they do not deserve.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Natty does share his names with Hetty, but it is unclear whether this would be enough for her to determine his character. The narrative suggests that while names can carry virtue, they may not always accurately reflect a person's true nature." />

I put no great dependence, therefore, on names.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me all your names,&quot; repeated the girl, earnestly, for her mind&#10;was too simple to separate things from professions, and she did attach&#10;importance to a name; &quot;I want to know what to think of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sartain; I've no objection, and you shall hear them all. In the&#10;first place, then, I'm Christian, and white-born, like yourself, and my&#10;parents had a name that came down from father to son, as is a part of&#10;their gifts.

I'm a&#10;young man, and, as yet, have never been on a war-path; but no sooner did&#10;the news come among the Delawares, that wampum and a hatchet were about&#10;to be sent in to the tribe, than they wished me to go out among the&#10;people of my own color, and get the exact state of things for 'em. This&#10;I did, and, after delivering my talk to the chiefs, on my return, I met&#10;an officer of the crown on the Schoharie, who had messages to send to&#10;some of the fri'ndly" />

I dare to say that such a lovely spot as this, would not be&#10;likely to be overlooked by such plunderers, for, though I've not been&#10;in the way of quarreling with them tribes myself, the Delawares give&#10;me such an account of 'em that I've pretty much set 'em down in my own&#10;mind, as thorough miscreants.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You may do that with a safe conscience, or for that matter, any other&#10;savage you may happen to meet.&quot;&#10;&#10;Here Deerslayer protested, and as they went paddling down the lake, a&#10;hot discussion was maintained concerning the respective merits of&#10;the pale-faces and the red-skins. Hurry had all the prejudices and&#10;antipathies of a white hunter, who generally regards the Indian as a&#10;sort of natural competitor, and" />
    <node id="The rock that Hurry and his companions pass by in their canoe is a rounded, beehive-shaped formation about five or six feet high, with only half of it visible above the water level. Its unique shape, as well as its regular and even form, makes it easily recognizable to all local Indians, who use it as a landmark for meeting when separated during hunts and marches.&#10;&#10;This rock is located near the beginning of the river, which starts in its vicinity. The constant washing of water over centuries has given the rock's summit a rounded appearance, contributing to its distinctive beehive shape. The rock's significance in marking the starting point of the river and serving as a local landmark emphasizes its importance in the region's geography and cultural practices." />

Hurry hesitated an instant;&#10;then raising his rifle hastily to his shoulder, he took sight and fired.&#10;The effect of this sudden interruption of the solemn stillness of such&#10;a scene was not its least striking peculiarity. The report of the weapon&#10;had the usual sharp, short sound of the rifle: but when a few moments&#10;of silence had succeeded the sudden crack, during which the noise was&#10;floating in air across the water, it reached the rocks of the opposite&#10;mountain, where the vibrations accumulated, and were rolled from cavity&#10;to cavity for miles along the hills, seeming to awaken the sleeping&#10;thunders of the woods. The buck merely shook his head at the report of&#10;the rifle and the whistling of the bullet, for never before had he come&#10;in contact with man; but the echoes of the hills awakened his distrust,&#10;and leaping forward, with his four legs drawn under his body, he fell&#10;at once into deep water, and began to swim towards the foot of the lake.&#10;Hurry shouted and dashed forward in chase, and for one or two minutes" />
    <node id="Deerslayer and his companion find it difficult to locate the outlet of the stream because the trees and bushes overhang the water, creating a fringe that conceals any variations from the general outline of the lake. They are looking for it with curiosity because they expect to find the &quot;ark&quot; (a large boat) in the outlet or near it, as it is a favorite hiding place for the owner of the &quot;ark.&quot; The outlet of the stream is significant because it provides access to a river that connects to other areas, potentially used by Native Americans for traveling and trapping." />
    <node id="1. Hurry harbors strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes, viewing them as natural competitors or enemies. He believes in the inferiority of non-white human races and has dogmatic opinions on the subject. His conscience bothers him about his lawless acts against the Indians, which he quiets by denying their human rights.&#10;2. Deerslayer, however, sees both pale-faces and red-skins as men of different races and colors with the same nature. He acknowledges that they have souls and will be held accountable for their deeds in this life. He is more open to reason, fair in his views, and not easily influenced by prejudice.&#10;&#10;During their discussion while paddling down the lake:&#10;3. Hurry dismisses Deerslayer's argument as boyish misconceptions due to Delaware arts and missionary ignorance.&#10;4. Despite this, Deerslayer maintains that both groups are men with souls who will be held accountable for their actions in life.&#10;5. Hurry becomes angry when his proposition is denied, especially if accompanied by plausible argument, while Deerslayer remains calm and composed, demonstrating a fair temperament and strong innate desire to do justice." />
    <node id=" are&#10;both Injins?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I do say they are both men. Men of different races and colors, and&#10;having different gifts and traditions, but, in the main, with the same&#10;natur'. Both have souls; and both will be held accountable for their&#10;deeds in this life.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hurry was one of those theorists who believed in the inferiority of all&#10;the human race who were not white. His notions on the subject were&#10;not very clear, nor were his definitions at all well settled; but his&#10;opinions were none the less dogmatical or fierce. His conscience accused&#10;him of sundry lawless acts against the Indians, and he had found it an&#10;exceedingly easy mode of quieting it, by putting the whole family of&#10;redmen, incontinently, without the category of human rights. Nothing&#10;angered him sooner than to deny his proposition, more especially if the&#10;denial were accompanied by a show of plausible argument; and he did not&#10;listen to his companion's remarks with much composure of either manner&#10;or feeling.&#10;&#10;&quot;You're a boy, Deerslayer, misled and misconsaited by Delaware arts, and&#10;missionary ignorance" />
    <node id=". Hurry had all the prejudices and&#10;antipathies of a white hunter, who generally regards the Indian as a&#10;sort of natural competitor, and not unfrequently as a natural enemy.&#10;As a matter of course, he was loud, clamorous, dogmatical and not&#10;very argumentative. Deerslayer, on the other hand, manifested a very&#10;different temper, proving by the moderation of his language, the&#10;fairness of his views, and the simplicity of his distinctions, that he&#10;possessed every disposition to hear reason, a strong, innate desire to&#10;do justice, and an ingenuousness that was singularly indisposed to have&#10;recourse to sophism to maintain an argument; or to defend a prejudice.&#10;Still he was not altogether free from the influence of the latter&#10;feeling. This tyrant of the human mind, which ruses on it prey through&#10;a thousand avenues, almost as soon as men begin to think and feel, and&#10;which seldom relinquishes its iron sway until they cease to do&#10;either, had made some impression on even the just propensities of this&#10;individual, who probably offered in these particulars, a fair specimen&#10;of what absence from bad example, the want of temptation" />
    <node id="The young Delaware man, named Deerslayer, was sent by his tribe to gather information about the movements of people of his own color after hearing news of wampum and a hatchet being sent to the tribe because the tribe wanted to know the exact state of things among the white people. This mission also served as Deerslayer's first war path, as he had never been on one before. He met an officer of the crown on the Schoharie who had messages to send to some of the friendly tribes that live farther west, and Deerslayer and his friend Chingachgook decided to accompany him on this journey as it was their first war path." />
    <node id=" who&#10;has meetings with savages in a part of the country where he has&#10;never been before?&quot; demanded Hutter, in a tone and in a manner that&#10;sufficiently indicated the motive of the question; these rude beings&#10;seldom hesitating, on the score of delicacy, to betray their feelings.&#10;&quot;Treachery is an Indian virtue; and the whites, that live much in their&#10;tribes, soon catch their ways and practices.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True--true as the Gospel, old Tom; but not personable to Deerslayer,&#10;who's a young man of truth, if he has no other ricommend. I'll answer&#10;for his honesty, whatever I may do for his valor in battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I should like to know his errand in this strange quarter of the&#10;country.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is soon told, Master Hutter,&quot; said the young man, with the&#10;composure of one who kept a clean conscience. &quot;I think, moreover, you've&#10;a right to ask it. The father of two such darters, who occupies a lake,&#10;after your fashion, has just the same right to inquire into a stranger's&#10;business in his neighborhood, as the colony" />
    <node id=" on my return, I met&#10;an officer of the crown on the Schoharie, who had messages to send to&#10;some of the fri'ndly tribes that live farther west. This was thought a&#10;good occasion for Chingachgook, a young chief who has never struck a&#10;foe, and myself; to go on our first war path in company, and an&#10;app'intment was made for us, by an old Delaware, to meet at the rock&#10;near the foot of this lake. I'll not deny that Chingachgook has another&#10;object in view, but it has no consarn with any here, and is his secret&#10;and not mine; therefore I'll say no more about it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis something about a young woman,&quot; interrupted Judith hastily, then&#10;laughing at her own impetuosity, and even having the grace to colour a&#10;little, at the manner in which she had betrayed her readiness to impute&#10;such a motive. &quot;If 'tis neither war, nor a hunt, it must be love.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, it comes easy for the young and handsome, who hear so much of them&#10;feelin's, to suppose that they lie at the" />
    <node id=" pretty&#10;much all that is said or done on the Glimmerglass, in this calm summer&#10;weather. If a paddle falls you hear of it sometimes, ag'in and ag'in,&#10;as if the hills were mocking your clumsiness, and a laugh, or a whistle,&#10;comes out of them pines, when they're in the humour to speak, in a way&#10;to make you believe they can r'ally convarse.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So much the more reason for being prudent and silent. I do not think&#10;the inimy can have found their way into these hills yet, for I don't&#10;know what they are to gain by it, but all the Delawares tell me that, as&#10;courage is a warrior's first vartue, so is prudence his second. One such&#10;call from the mountains, is enough to let a whole tribe into the secret&#10;of our arrival.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If it does no other good, it will warn old Tom to put the pot over, and&#10;let him know visiters are at hand. Come, lad; get into the canoe, and we&#10;will hunt the ark up, while there is yet day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer" />
    <node id="The ark, the floating habitation of the Hutters in &quot;Indian Story,&quot; is a simple contrivance consisting of a large flat or scow that forms the buoyant part of the vessel. In the center of the scow, there is a low fabric resembling a castle in construction but made of light materials, making it barely bullet-proof. The addition of this structure does not make the vessel appear clumsy or obtrusive, as the sides of the scow are higher than usual and the interior of the cabin has no more elevation than necessary for comfort. The cabin is divided into two apartments, one serving as a parlor and sleeping room for the father, while the other is used by the daughters. A simple arrangement suffices for the kitchen, which is at one end of the scow and open to the air, making the ark a summer habitation." />
    <node id=" and the frown&#10;that she cast on Hurry, though simulated and pettish, had the effect to&#10;render her beauty more striking, by exhibiting the play of an expressive&#10;but capricious countenance; one that seemed to change from the soft&#10;to the severe, the mirthful to the reproving, with facility and&#10;indifference.&#10;&#10;A second look explained the nature of the surprise. Unwittingly, the men&#10;had dropped alongside of the ark, which had been purposely concealed in&#10;bushes cut and arranged for the purpose; and Judith Hutter had merely&#10;pushed aside the leaves that lay before a window, in order to show her&#10;face, and speak to them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;And that timid fawn starts not with fear,&#10;    When I steal to her secret bower;&#10;    And that young May violet to me is dear,&#10;    And I visit the silent streamlet near,&#10;    To look on the lovely flower.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Bryant, &quot;An Indian Story,&quot; ii.11-15&#10;&#10;The ark, as the floating habitation of the Hutters was generally called,&#10;was a very simple" />
    <node id=" Indian habits told him at once that they were all in their&#10;war-paint, and belonged to a hostile tribe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pull, Hurry,&quot; he cried; &quot;pull for your life, and as you love Judith&#10;Hutter! Pull, man, pull!&quot;&#10;&#10;This call was made to one that the young man knew had the strength of a&#10;giant. It was so earnest and solemn, that both Hutter and March felt&#10;it was not idly given, and they applied all their force to the line&#10;simultaneously, and at a most critical moment. The scow redoubled its&#10;motion, and seemed to glide from under the tree as if conscious of&#10;the danger that was impending overhead. Perceiving that they were&#10;discovered, the Indians uttered the fearful war-whoop, and running&#10;forward on the tree, leaped desperately towards their fancied prize.&#10;There were six on the tree, and each made the effort. All but their&#10;leader fell into the river more or less distant from the ark, as they&#10;came, sooner or later, to the leaping place. The chief, who had taken&#10;the dangerous post in advance, having an earlier opportunity than the&#10;" />
    <node id="The text suggests that Hurry fired his rifle during war-time partly out of carelessness and partly due to overconfidence in his ability to evade detection. He had previously mentioned his concern about the possibility of enemies being nearby, but when he heard an unfamiliar shot, he impulsively decided to fire his own rifle, disregarding the potential risk of revealing their position to any hostile forces. This action was likely motivated by a combination of curiosity (wanting to see if the buck would react to the sound of the gunshot) and overconfidence in his ability to remain hidden from potential enemies. However, the narrative makes it clear that this was an imprudent decision on Hurry's part, as the echo from his rifle shot traveled a great distance and could have potentially alerted nearby enemies to their presence." />
    <node id=", we ought not to lie here a minute longer than is&#10;necessary,&quot; said Hutter, glancing through the leaves of his cover, as if&#10;he already distrusted the presence of an enemy on the opposite shore of&#10;the narrow and sinuous stream. &quot;It wants but an hour or so of night,&#10;and to move in the dark will be impossible, without making a noise that&#10;would betray us. Did you hear the echo of a piece in the mountains,&#10;half-an-hour since?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, old man, and heard the piece itself,&quot; answered Hurry, who now felt&#10;the indiscretion of which he had been guilty, &quot;for the last was fired&#10;from my own shoulder.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I feared it came from the French Indians; still it may put them on the&#10;look-out, and be a means of discovering us. You did wrong to fire in&#10;war-time, unless there was good occasion.&#10;&#10;&quot;So I begin to think myself, Uncle Tom; and yet, if a man can't trust&#10;himself to let off his rifle in a wilderness that is a thousand miles&#10;square, lest some inimy should hear it, where's the use in carrying&#10;" />
    <node id=" sufficient depth of limpid water, with a strong current, and a&#10;canopy of leaves upheld by arches composed of the limbs of hoary trees.&#10;Bushes lined the shores, as usual, but they left sufficient space&#10;between them to admit the passage of anything that did not exceed twenty&#10;feet in width, and to allow of a perspective ahead of eight or ten times&#10;that distance.&#10;&#10;Neither of our two adventurers used his paddle, except to keep the light&#10;bark in the centre of the current, but both watched each turning of the&#10;stream, of which there were two or three within the first hundred yards,&#10;with jealous vigilance. Turn after turn, however, was passed, and the&#10;canoe had dropped down with the current some little distance, when Hurry&#10;caught a bush, and arrested its movement so suddenly and silently as to&#10;denote some unusual motive for the act. Deerslayer laid his hand on the&#10;stock of his rifle as soon as he noted this proceeding, but it was quite&#10;as much with a hunter's habit as from any feeling of alarm.&#10;&#10;&quot;There the old fellow is!&quot; whispered Hurry, pointing with a finger, and&#10;laughing heartily, though he" />
    <node id=" to let off his rifle in a wilderness that is a thousand miles&#10;square, lest some inimy should hear it, where's the use in carrying&#10;one?&quot;&#10;&#10;Hutter now held a long consultation with his two guests, in which the&#10;parties came to a true understanding of their situation. He explained&#10;the difficulty that would exist in attempting to get the ark out of&#10;so swift and narrow a stream, in the dark, without making a noise that&#10;could not fail to attract Indian ears. Any strollers in their vicinity&#10;would keep near the river or the lake; but the former had swampy shores&#10;in many places, and was both so crooked and so fringed with bushes, that&#10;it was quite possible to move by daylight without incurring much danger&#10;of being seen. More was to be apprehended, perhaps, from the ear than&#10;from the eye, especially as long as they were in the short, straitened,&#10;and canopied reaches of the stream.&#10;&#10;&quot;I never drop down into this cover, which is handy to my traps, and&#10;safer than the lake from curious eyes, without providing the means of&#10;getting out ag'in,&quot; continued this singular being; &quot;and that" />
    <node id=" am not to expect any to&#10;turn their eyes on me, when such a one as you can be gazed on; but I&#10;do not know that a hunter is less expart with the rifle, or less to be&#10;relied on for food, because he doesn't wish to stop at every shining&#10;spring he may meet, to study his own countenance in the water.&quot;&#10;&#10;Here Hurry burst into a fit of loud laughter; for while he was too&#10;reckless to care much about his own manifest physical superiority, he&#10;was well aware of it, and, like most men who derive an advantage from&#10;the accidents of birth or nature, he was apt to think complacently on&#10;the subject, whenever it happened to cross his mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no, Deerslayer, you're no beauty, as you will own yourself, if&#10;you'll look over the side of the canoe,&quot; he cried; &quot;Jude will say that&#10;to your face, if you start her, for a tarter tongue isn't to be found in&#10;any gal's head, in or out of the settlements, if you provoke her to use&#10;it. My advice to you is, never to aggravate Judith; though you" />
    <node id="The noise of a heavy object, sounding like a man's tread, was made by a buck moving through the woods. Both Hurry Harry and Deerslayer reached for their rifles in response to this noise, indicating that they were on high alert for potential threats. Deerslayer then formulates a plan to investigate the source of the noise by having Hurry hold the canoe steady while he goes ashore and moves cautiously towards the sound, using the bushes for cover. This plan allows Deerslayer to approach the source of the noise without making further disturbance and potentially putting himself in danger." />

At this instant a dry stick was heard cracking on the narrow&#10;strip of land that concealed the bay from the open lake. Both the&#10;adventurers started, and each extended a hand towards his rifle, the&#10;weapon never being out of reach of the arm.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twas too heavy for any light creatur',&quot; whispered Hurry, &quot;and it&#10;sounded like the tread of a man!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not so--not so,&quot; returned Deerslayer; &quot;'t was, as you say, too heavy&#10;for one, but it was too light for the other. Put your paddle in the&#10;water, and send the canoe in, to that log; I'll land and cut off the" />
    <node id="The purpose of changing the position of the ark on the river, as opposed to using the cabin as a safe cover and defense, is to avoid being exposed in open water while also putting the ark out of enemy's sight. By moving to the open lake, they can avoid providing curious eyes with the means of seeing what's happening inside the cabin. Additionally, changing position makes it more challenging for potential enemies to approach without being noticed since Deerslayer will keep watch from window to window, preventing any surprise attacks.&#10;&#10;The cover of branches and bushes has been useful so far in concealing the ark and protecting it from enemies. However, once they reach open water, this cover will no longer be effective as it leaves them vulnerable to enemy attacks while also restricting their visibility. By moving to the open lake, they can minimize this risk and maintain a better lookout for potential threats. This proactive approach ensures their safety and allows them to react more effectively if an attack occurs." />
    <node id=", and&#10;safer than the lake from curious eyes, without providing the means of&#10;getting out ag'in,&quot; continued this singular being; &quot;and that is easier&#10;done by a pull than a push. My anchor is now lying above the suction, in&#10;the open lake; and here is a line, you see, to haul us up to it. Without&#10;some such help, a single pair of hands would make heavy work in forcing&#10;a scow like this up stream. I have a sort of a crab, too, that lightens&#10;the pull, on occasion. Jude can use the oar astern as well as myself;&#10;and when we fear no enemy, to get out of the river gives us but little&#10;trouble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What should we gain, Master Hutter, by changing the position?&quot; asked&#10;Deerslayer, with a good deal of earnestness; &quot;this is a safe cover, and&#10;a stout defence might be made from the inside of this cabin.

And now, Hurry, we'll step into this outer room ourselves, and&#10;haul through the door, where we shall all be safe, from a surprise, at&#10;least. Friend Deerslayer, as the current is lighter, and the line has&#10;all the strain on it that is prudent, do you keep moving from window to&#10;window, taking care not to let your head be seen, if you set any value&#10;on life. No one knows when or where we shall hear from our neighbors.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer complied, with a sensation that had nothing in common with&#10;fear, but which had all the interest of a perfectly novel and a most&#10;exciting situation.

It was no sooner free from the incumbrance of&#10;the branches, than it swung into the stream, sheering quite close to the&#10;western shore, by the force of the current. Not a soul on board heard&#10;the rustling of the branches, as the cabin came against the bushes and&#10;trees of the western bank, without a feeling of uneasiness; for no one&#10;knew at what moment, or in what place, a secret and murderous enemy&#10;might unmask himself. Perhaps the gloomy light that still struggled&#10;through the impending canopy of leaves, or found its way through the&#10;narrow, ribbon-like opening, which seemed to mark, in the air above,&#10;the course of the river that flowed beneath, aided in augmenting the&#10;appearance of the danger; for it was little more than sufficient to&#10;render objects visible, without giving up all their outlines at a&#10;glance. Although the sun had not absolutely set, it had withdrawn its&#10;direct rays from the valley; and the hues of evening were beginning to&#10;gather around objects that stood uncovered, rendering those within the&#10;" />
    <node id="Floating Tom and his companions used an anchor and changes in the river's direction, marked by stones, to facilitate the ark's movement and avoid detection. By dropping heavy stones in the center of the stream as local anchors, they created a system that prevented annoyances and obstacles caused by the short turns of the river. This technique also allowed them to keep the scow's broad bottom above water, reducing resistance from the swift-moving element beneath it. The anchor, lying well out in the lake, served as the uppermost &quot;backing&quot; for the local anchors, ensuring the ark remained clear of the shore and avoiding any potential discovery by their enemies. Overall, they intelligently utilized natural elements such as the river's current, stones to mark direction, and an anchor to move the ark swiftly and secretively downstream." />

In consequence of this expedient, the ark floated&#10;clear of the incumbrances of the shore, against which it would otherwise&#10;have been unavoidably hauled at every turn, producing embarrassments&#10;that Hutter, single-handed, would have found it very difficult to&#10;overcome. Favored by this foresight, and stimulated by the apprehension&#10;of discovery, Floating Tom and his two athletic companions hauled the&#10;ark ahead with quite as much rapidity as comported with the strength&#10;of the line. At every turn in the stream, a stone was raised from the&#10;bottom, when the direction of the scow changed to one that pointed&#10;towards the stone that lay above. In this manner, with the channel&#10;buoyed out for him, as a sailor might term it, did Hutter move forward,&#10;occasionally urging his friends, in a low and guarded voice, to increase&#10;their exertions, and then, as occasions offered, warning them against&#10;efforts that might, at particular moments, endanger all by too much&#10;zeal.

    <node id="The female speaker that suddenly appeared is Hetty Hutter. Based on her words, it can be inferred that she has had some interaction with Hurry Harry before, as she comments on his changed behavior and the company he keeps. She seems to be unaware of any ill-will Hurry may hold against Native Americans, which suggests that she is not part of his prejudiced views. Hetty appears to be familiar with Deerslayer, addressing him in a kind tone and trusting his companionship. She also shows some education in her speech, distinguishing her from the rougher personality of Hurry Harry. The text describes her as a &quot;singularly handsome and youthful female face,&quot; which further highlights her appearance during this encounter." />

    <node id="1. The cabin of the ark was divided into two apartments - one serving as a parlor and sleeping room for the father, while the other was used by the daughters.&#10;2. A simple kitchen arrangement was made at one end of the scow, open to the air.&#10;3. For concealment, the &quot;and-bush&quot; or covering of overhanging trees and bushes was utilized. The ark was anchored under such a cover with branches bent down to dip into the river, making it difficult for enemies to locate.&#10;4. Stones were fastened to the ends of the branches to make them bend sufficiently, and severed bushes were properly disposed to complete the concealment.&#10;5. The cabin was constructed to resemble a castle but made of light materials, barely bullet-proof.&#10;6. The scow was skillfully put together, being comparatively light for its strength and manageable.&#10;7. Hutter adopted a precaution of dropping heavy stones attached to the line in the center of the stream while descending the river to prevent annoyances and obstacles that would otherwise have attended the short turns of the river.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;and-bush&quot; was used by Hurry, who had limited English knowledge, to describe the covering of overhanging trees and bushes that concealed the ark. It is a combination of &quot;and,&quot; indicating connection, and &quot;bush,&quot; referring to the overhanging branches and smaller trees." />
    <node id="The nickname &quot;Deerslayer&quot; signifies Deerslayer's ability to provide for himself and others by hunting deer, which he considers superior to the scalping of humans. This aligns with Hetty's values, as she appreciates his calling and finds it more honorable than the military officers' violent occupation. She even prefers his last name, &quot;Deerslayer,&quot; over the seemingly fancier but less meaningful name &quot;Natty Bumppo.&quot; The nickname represents Deerslayer's connection to nature and his respect for all life forms, which resonates with Hetty's straightforward and genuine personality." />

She says the officers are great, and gay, and of soft&#10;speech; but they make me shudder, for their business is to kill their&#10;fellow-creatures.

    <node id="The six Indians trying to capture the scow were from a hostile tribe, as indicated by their war-paint. However, their specific tribal identity is not mentioned in the narrative. After leaping towards the scow, five of them fell into the river at various distances from the ark.

Still, he made us, in the main, much the same in&#10;feelin's; though I'll not deny that he gave each race its gifts. A&#10;white man's gifts are Christianized, while a red-skin's are more for the&#10;wilderness. Thus, it would be a great offence for a white man to scalp&#10;the dead; whereas it's a signal vartue in an Indian.

    <node id="Based on the passage, it is clear that Deerslayer and Hurry have different opinions on the character of Native American tribes. Hurry harbors strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes, viewing them as natural competitors or enemies. He believes in the inferiority of non-white human races and has dogmatic opinions on the subject, denying their human rights to quiet his conscience about his lawless acts against the Indians. On the other hand, Deerslayer sees both pale-faces and red-skins as men of different races and colors with the same nature. He acknowledges that they have souls and will be held accountable for their deeds in this life, demonstrating a more open and reasonable mindset. Hurry becomes angry when his proposition is denied, especially if accompanied by plausible argument, while Deerslayer remains calm and composed, further highlighting their differing temperaments." />
    <node id="Floating Tom and his companions used several strategic measures to navigate the ark away from the shore and through the lake's channel. First, they dropped heavy stones in the center of the stream as local anchors, which prevented obstacles caused by the short turns of the river and kept the broad bottom of the scow above water. This reduced resistance from the swift-moving element beneath it. The anchor lying well out in the lake served as the uppermost &quot;backing&quot; for the local anchors, ensuring the ark remained clear of the shore and avoiding any potential discovery by their enemies (supporting materials, first and second paragraphs).&#10;&#10;Hutter also adopted a precaution suggested by experience, which involved dropping heavy stones attached to the line in the center of the stream as they descended. These local anchors prevented annoyances and obstacles that would have otherwise attended the short turns of the river (supporting materials, last two paragraphs).&#10;&#10;As the ark passed steadily ahead, Hutter encouraged and guided his companions by occasionally urging them to increase their exertions and warning them against efforts that might endanger all by too much zeal (third paragraph from the bottom).&#10;&#10;In addition, Hutter had a grapnel or anchor lying well out in the lake, which served as the &quot;backing&quot; for the local anchors. This ensured that the ark floated clear of the incumbrances of the shore and moved swiftly and secretively downstream (supporting materials, first and second paragraphs).&#10;&#10;Hurry Harry, another companion, examined the whole of the northern end of the water with an indifferent ship's glass before embarking in the canoe. He scrutinized every part of the shore, including the bays and points, to ensure that there were no enemies lurking around (last two paragraphs from the bottom)." />

Here the last&#10;stone was raised from the bottom, and the line led directly towards the&#10;grapnel, which, as Hutter had explained, was dropped above the suction&#10;of the current.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank God!&quot; ejaculated Hurry, &quot;there is daylight, and we shall soon&#10;have a chance of seeing our inimies, if we are to feel 'em.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is more than you or any man can say,&quot; growled Hutter. &quot;There is no&#10;spot so likely to harbor a party as the shore around the outlet, and the&#10;moment we clear these trees and get into open water, will be the most&#10;trying time, since it will leave the enemy a cover, while it puts us&#10;out of one.

    <node id="&#10;    &quot;Come, shall we go and kill us venison?&#10;    And yet it irks me, the poor dappled foals,--&#10;    Being native burghers of this desert city,--&#10;    Should, in their own confines, with forked heads&#10;    Have their round haunches gored.&quot;&#10;&#10;    As You Like It, II.i.21-25&#10;&#10;Hurry Harry thought more of the beauties of Judith Hutter than of those&#10;of the Glimmerglass and its accompanying scenery. As soon as he had&#10;taken a sufficiently intimate survey of floating Tom's implements,&#10;therefore, he summoned his companion to the canoe, that they might go&#10;down the lake in quest of the family. Previously to embarking, however,&#10;Hurry carefully examined the whole of the northern end of the water with&#10;an indifferent ship's glass, that formed a part of Hutter's effects. In&#10;this scrutiny, no part of the shore was overlooked; the bays and points&#10;in particular being subjected to a closer inquiry than the rest of the&#10;wooded boundary.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis as I thought,&quot; said Hurry," />
    <node id="1. Prejudice and Antipathy: Hurry Harry has strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes, viewing them as natural competitors or enemies. His belief in the inferiority of non-white human races and dogmatic opinions lead him to deny their human rights, justifying his lawless acts against the Indians.&#10;&#10;2. Differing Worldviews: Deerslayer and Hurry have different worldviews when it comes to dealing with Native American tribes. While Deerslayer sees both pale-faces and red-skins as men of different races and colors with the same nature, Hurry dismisses Deerslayer's argument as boyish misconceptions due to Delaware arts and missionary ignorance.&#10;&#10;3. Fear and Suspicion: The six Indians trying to capture the scow were from a hostile tribe, indicating that fear and suspicion can also lead individuals to become enemies. This is further exemplified by Hurry's reaction to the noise of a heavy object in the woods, where both he and Deerslayer reach for their rifles in response to this possible threat.&#10;&#10;4. Power and Dominance: The example of Hurry illustrates how some people choose to become enemies with others as a means of asserting power and dominance. His belief in his own racial superiority fuels his antagonism towards Native American tribes, leading him to commit lawless acts against them.&#10;&#10;5. Lack of Understanding and Communication: The passage suggests that a lack of understanding and communication can also lead individuals to become enemies. Deerslayer's more open and reasonable mindset allows him to see both pale-faces and red-skins as men with souls who will be held accountable for their deeds in this life, while Hurry's closed-mindedness and prejudice prevent him from acknowledging the common humanity between the two groups." />
    <node id="1. The dangerous situation Deerslayer is facing is the potential threat of Native American tribes, particularly the Mingos and French savages, who may be in the area. Both Deerslayer and Hurry are on high alert for potential threats, as evidenced by their reaction to a noise that turned out to be a buck moving through the woods.&#10;2. To ensure their safety, Deerslayer formulates a plan to investigate the source of the noise by having Hurry hold the canoe steady while he goes ashore and moves cautiously towards the sound using bushes for cover. This plan allows Deerslayer to approach the source of the noise without making further disturbance and potentially putting himself in danger.&#10;3. Additionally, Deerslayer and Hurry are looking for the outlet of a stream because they expect to find an &quot;ark&quot; (a large boat) in the outlet or near it. The outlet of the stream is significant because it provides access to a river that connects to other areas, potentially used by Native Americans for traveling and trapping. By locating the &quot;ark,&quot; Deerslayer and Hurry can better assess any potential threats in the area.&#10;4. Furthermore, Deerslayer demonstrates his calm and composed demeanor, maintaining his beliefs about the equality of all men, including Native Americans, despite Hurry's prejudiced views. This fair temperament and strong innate desire to do justice help Deerslayer navigate dangerous situations with a clear head." />
    <node id="Hutter, or Floating Tom, was pleased to see Hurry arrive in the canoe because he had been expecting him some days earlier. He was slightly disappointed because Hurry's late arrival might have affected his plans. Hutter had anticipated that Hurry would bring assistance, as they intended to move the ark to a new location down the river. The &quot;moat&quot; of bushes surrounding the hidden narrow stream provided cover and concealment for Old Tom's boat, making it an ideal hiding place. With Hurry's help, Hutter could more easily maneuver the ark away from its current position." />
    <node id="arn in it. It's easy to see which way that&#10;poor creatur's feelin's are leanin', whatever may be the case with your&#10;Jude's.&quot;&#10;&#10;But an interruption was put to the gallantry of Hurry, the coquetry&#10;of his intros, the thoughts of Deerslayer, and the gentle feelings of&#10;Hetty, by the sudden appearance of the canoe of the ark's owner, in the&#10;narrow opening among the bushes that served as a sort of moat to&#10;his position. It would seem that Hutter, or Floating Tom, as he was&#10;familiarly called by all the hunters who knew his habits, recognized the&#10;canoe of Hurry, for he expressed no surprise at finding him in the&#10;scow. On the contrary, his reception was such as to denote not only&#10;gratification, but a pleasure, mingled with a little disappointment at&#10;his not having made his appearance some days sooner.&#10;&#10;&quot;I looked for you last week,&quot; he said, in a half-grumbling,&#10;half-welcoming manner; &quot;and was disappointed uncommonly that you didn't&#10;arrive. There came a runner through, to warn all" />
    <node id="1. The noise that startled Deerslayer and Hurry was not a threat, but rather a buck moving through the woods.&#10;2. When investigating the source of the noise, Deerslayer formulates a plan to minimize risk by having Hurry hold the canoe steady while he moves towards the sound using bushes for cover.&#10;3. Five out of six Indians trying to capture the scow ended up in the river after failing to jump onto it.&#10;4. Deerslayer and Hurry are searching for the outlet of a stream, which leads to a river used by Native Americans for traveling and trapping. They hope to find an &quot;ark&quot; (a large boat) in the outlet or near it.&#10;5. The river's outlet is hidden due to high, steep banks covered by trees, bushes, and pines, making it difficult to locate." />
    <node id="1. Hurry harbors strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes, viewing them as natural competitors or enemies. He believes in the inferiority of non-white human races and has dogmatic opinions on the subject. His conscience bothers him about his lawless acts against the Indians, which he quiets by denying their human rights.&#10;&#10;In the passage provided, it is evident that Hurry holds strong beliefs about the inferiority of non-white human races, particularly Native American tribes. He sees them as natural enemies or competitors and dismisses Deerslayer's argument that both pale-faces and red-skins are men with souls who will be held accountable for their deeds in this life. Instead, Hurry justifies his treatment of the Indians by denying their human rights, which he finds to be an easy way to quiet his conscience about his lawless acts against them.&#10;&#10;Hurry's beliefs about the inferiority of non-white human races are rooted in his dogmatic opinions and lack of understanding and communication. He is unwilling to acknowledge the common humanity between pale-faces and red-skins, instead viewing the latter as a separate category of beings without human rights. This closed-mindedness fuels Hurry's antagonism towards Native American tribes, leading him to commit lawless acts against them and justify his treatment of them based on his prejudiced views." />
    <node id="based on the passage, Hurry harbors strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes. He sees them as natural competitors or enemies and believes in their inferiority, justifying his lawless acts against them by denying their human rights. This is in contrast to Deerslayer's views, who sees both pale-faces and red-skins as men of different races and colors with the same nature, acknowledging that they have souls and will be held accountable for their deeds in this life. While paddling down the lake, Hurry dismisses Deerslayer's argument as misconceptions, but Deerslayer maintains his stance, demonstrating a fair temperament and strong desire to do justice." />
    <node id="1. The primary reason Hurry Harry wants to go down the lake instead of admiring the scenery is that he harbors strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes. He sees them as natural competitors or enemies and believes in their inferiority, justifying his lawless acts against them by denying their human rights. Hurry is eager to find Old Tom's boat (or &quot;ark&quot;) to use it for trapping and trading with the Indians, which he considers a legitimate pursuit despite Deerslayer's concerns about justice and fairness.&#10;   &#10;2. Before they embark on their journey, Hurry does not explicitly express his intentions but rather abruptly stops paddling when he spots what he believes to be Old Tom's boat in the narrow stream. He starts laughing, pointing towards the hidden &quot;ark&quot; as a sign of his success and eagerness to proceed with his plan." />
    <node id="Hurry fired his rifle during war-time partly out of carelessness and overconfidence in his ability to evade detection. He was motivated by curiosity to see if the buck would react to the sound of the gunshot, as well as overconfidence in his ability to remain hidden from potential enemies. However, this was an imprudent decision on Hurry's part, as the echo from his rifle shot traveled a great distance and could have potentially alerted nearby enemies to their presence. Hutter also criticizes Hurry for firing without a good reason, as it might put them at risk of discovery by the enemy." />
    <node id="When a shot is fired next to a lake, the sound can travel a great distance due to the echo effect created by the surrounding hills and mountains. This can potentially alert nearby enemies to one's presence, as was the case when Hurry fired his rifle during war-time. The buck that Deerslayer and Hurry were observing shook its head at the report of the rifle but continued swimming in the lake, unharmed by the bullet. However, the echoes of the shot awakened the buck's distrust, causing it to swim towards the foot of the lake.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the sound of a gunshot can have a significant impact on the surrounding environment. The noise can startle animals and disrupt their natural behavior, as seen in this passage when the buck was initially spooked by the sound of Hurry's rifle shot. The echoes of the shot also have the effect of awakening the sleeping thunders of the woods, creating a loud and striking sound that reverberates through the surrounding hills and mountains." />

    <edge source="Based on the passage, Deerslayer is able to determine that the moccasin did not come from the Delaware fashion. Instead, he suggests that it has a northern look and might come from beyond the Great Lakes." target="1. Prejudice and Antipathy: Hurry Harry has strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes, viewing them as natural competitors or enemies. His belief in the inferiority of non-white human races and dogmatic opinions lead him to deny their human rights, justifying his lawless acts against the Indians.&#10;&#10;2. Differing Worldviews: Deerslayer and Hurry have different worldviews when it comes to dealing with Native American tribes. While Deerslayer sees both pale-faces and red-skins as men of different races and colors with the same nature, Hurry dismisses Deerslayer's argument as boyish misconceptions due to Delaware arts and missionary ignorance.&#10;&#10;3. Fear and Suspicion: The six Indians trying to capture the scow were from a hostile tribe, indicating that fear and suspicion can also lead individuals to become enemies. This is further exemplified by Hurry's reaction to the noise of a heavy object in the woods, where both he and Deerslayer reach for their rifles in response to this possible threat.&#10;&#10;4. Power and Dominance: The example of Hurry illustrates how some people choose to become enemies with others as a means of asserting power and dominance. His belief in his own racial superiority fuels his antagonism towards Native American tribes, leading him to commit lawless acts against them.&#10;&#10;5. Lack of Understanding and Communication: The passage suggests that a lack of understanding and communication can also lead individuals to become enemies. Deerslayer's more open and reasonable mindset allows him to see both pale-faces and red-skins as men with souls who will be held accountable for their deeds in this life, while Hurry's closed-mindedness and prejudice prevent him from acknowledging the common humanity between the two groups.">

The anchor, lying well out in the lake, served as the uppermost &quot;backing&quot; for the local anchors, ensuring the ark remained clear of the shore and avoiding any potential discovery by their enemies. Overall, they intelligently utilized natural elements such as the river's current, stones to mark direction, and an anchor to move the ark swiftly and secretively downstream.">

This is further exemplified by Hurry's reaction to the noise of a heavy object in the woods, where both he and Deerslayer reach for their rifles in response to this possible threat.&#10;&#10;4. Power and Dominance: The example of Hurry illustrates how some people choose to become enemies with others as a means of asserting power and dominance. His belief in his own racial superiority fuels his antagonism towards Native American tribes, leading him to commit lawless acts against them.&#10;&#10;5. Lack of Understanding and Communication: The passage suggests that a lack of understanding and communication can also lead individuals to become enemies. Deerslayer's more open and reasonable mindset allows him to see both pale-faces and red-skins as men with souls who will be held accountable for their deeds in this life, while Hurry's closed-mindedness and prejudice prevent him from acknowledging the common humanity between the two groups.">

The dangerous situation Deerslayer is facing is the potential threat of Native American tribes, particularly the Mingos and French savages, who may be in the area. Both Deerslayer and Hurry are on high alert for potential threats, as evidenced by their reaction to a noise that turned out to be a buck moving through the woods.&#10;2. To ensure their safety, Deerslayer formulates a plan to investigate the source of the noise by having Hurry hold the canoe steady while he goes ashore and moves cautiously towards the sound using bushes for cover. This plan allows Deerslayer to approach the source of the noise without making further disturbance and potentially putting himself in danger.&#10;3. Additionally, Deerslayer and Hurry are looking for the outlet of a stream because they expect to find an &quot;ark&quot; (a large boat) in the outlet or near it. The outlet of the stream is significant because it provides access to a river that connects to other areas, potentially used by Native Americans for traveling and trapping. By locating the &quot;ark,&quot; Deerslayer and Hurry can better assess any potential threats in the area.&#10;4. Furthermore, Deerslayer demonstrates his calm and composed demeanor, maintaining his beliefs about the equality of all men, including Native Americans, despite Hurry's prejudiced views. This fair temperament and strong innate desire to do justice help Deerslayer navigate dangerous situations with a clear head.">

Prejudice and Antipathy: Hurry Harry has strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes, viewing them as natural competitors or enemies. His belief in the inferiority of non-white human races and dogmatic opinions lead him to deny their human rights, justifying his lawless acts against the Indians.&#10;&#10;2. Differing Worldviews: Deerslayer and Hurry have different worldviews when it comes to dealing with Native American tribes. While Deerslayer sees both pale-faces and red-skins as men of different races and colors with the same nature, Hurry dismisses Deerslayer's argument as boyish misconceptions due to Delaware arts and missionary ignorance.&#10;&#10;3. Fear and Suspicion: The six Indians trying to capture the scow were from a hostile tribe, indicating that fear and suspicion can also lead individuals to become enemies. This is further exemplified by Hurry's reaction to the noise of a heavy object in the woods, where both he and Deerslayer reach for their rifles in response to this possible threat.&#10;&#10;4. Power and Dominance: The example of Hurry illustrates how some people choose to become enemies with others as a means of asserting power and dominance. His belief in his own racial superiority fuels his antagonism towards Native American tribes, leading him to commit lawless acts against them.&#10;&#10;5. Lack of Understanding and Communication: The passage suggests that a lack of understanding and communication can also lead individuals to become enemies. Deerslayer's more open and reasonable mindset allows him to see both pale-faces and red-skins as men with souls who will be held accountable for their deeds in this life, while Hurry's closed-mindedness and prejudice prevent him from acknowledging the common humanity between the two groups.">

They hope to find an &quot;ark&quot; (a large boat) in the outlet or near it.&#10;5. The river's outlet is hidden due to high, steep banks covered by trees, bushes, and pines, making it difficult to locate.">

The primary reason Hurry Harry wants to go down the lake instead of admiring the scenery is that he harbors strong prejudices and antipathies towards Native American tribes. He sees them as natural competitors or enemies and believes in their inferiority, justifying his lawless acts against them by denying their human rights. Hurry is eager to find Old Tom's boat (or &quot;ark&quot;) to use it for trapping and trading with the Indians, which he considers a legitimate pursuit despite Deerslayer's concerns about justice and fairness.&#10;   &#10;2. Before they embark on their journey, Hurry does not explicitly express his intentions but rather abruptly stops paddling when he spots what he believes to be Old Tom's boat in the narrow stream. He starts laughing, pointing towards the hidden &quot;ark&quot; as a sign of his success and eagerness to proceed with his plan.">

Instead, Hurry justifies his treatment of the Indians by denying their human rights, which he finds to be an easy way to quiet his conscience about his lawless acts against them.&#10;&#10;Hurry's beliefs about the inferiority of non-white human races are rooted in his dogmatic opinions and lack of understanding and communication. He is unwilling to acknowledge the common humanity between pale-faces and red-skins, instead viewing the latter as a separate category of beings without human rights. This closed-mindedness fuels Hurry's antagonism towards Native American tribes, leading him to commit lawless acts against them and justify his treatment of them based on his prejudiced views.">

Both Deerslayer and Hurry are on high alert for potential threats, as evidenced by their reaction to a noise that turned out to be a buck moving through the woods.&#10;2. To ensure their safety, Deerslayer formulates a plan to investigate the source of the noise by having Hurry hold the canoe steady while he goes ashore and moves cautiously towards the sound using bushes for cover. This plan allows Deerslayer to approach the source of the noise without making further disturbance and potentially putting himself in danger.&#10;3. Additionally, Deerslayer and Hurry are looking for the outlet of a stream because they expect to find an &quot;ark&quot; (a large boat) in the outlet or near it. The outlet of the stream is significant because it provides access to a river that connects to other areas, potentially used by Native Americans for traveling and trapping. By locating the &quot;ark,&quot; Deerslayer and Hurry can better assess any potential threats in the area.&#10;4. Furthermore, Deerslayer demonstrates his calm and composed demeanor, maintaining his beliefs about the equality of all men, including Native Americans, despite Hurry's prejudiced views.

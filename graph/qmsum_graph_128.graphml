    <node id="Yes, it is possible to include a company badge or logo on a device that will be visible, regardless of the casing color. This can be achieved by ensuring that the badge or logo is designed in such a way that it contrasts with the casing color. For example, if the company logo is white, it would be visible on a dark-colored casing, but might not stand out as well on a white casing. However, as mentioned in the transcript, as long as the logo is designed to have sufficient contrast with the casing color, such as using a complementary color or a 3D effect, it will still be visible and legible to the user. The use of a stick-on badge or a raised logo can also help ensure visibility by adding depth and dimension to the logo." />

    <node id="1. Visibility of Windows badge on white casing: The designers discuss that even if the device has a white casing (which is the predominant color of the Windows badge), the badge would still be visible due to its contrasting design. This can include using a complementary color, a 3D effect, or adding depth and dimension to the logo.&#10;2. Branding: The designers mention that companies often get someone else to make devices and then badge them with their own company badge or logo. They agree that this method would work for a white casing as well.&#10;3. Secondary market for cases: The industrial designer brings up the possibility of creating a secondary market for selling cases. This may depend on whether there is a big enough market to support this idea. Other team members express their agreement.&#10;4. Color schemes and customization: The team briefly discusses using company color schemes and offering customization options like pink or red cases, which would appeal to different demographics." />
    <node id="1. Company Logo: The team decided to incorporate the company logo with its color scheme on the remote device. They mentioned that as long as the logo is designed to have sufficient contrast with the casing color, it will be visible and legible to the user.&#10;2. Device Design: The device will have a simple design, enabling the project to be completed on time. It will have two pages - a front page with the most wanted features for customers and a second page with backup features that meet technical requirements.&#10;3. Buttons: The remote will have 16 buttons, which have been reduced in number to maintain simplicity. There was some discussion about the design of the volume button, but no final decision has been made yet.&#10;4. Circuit Board: The industrial designer mentioned that there are different prices for simple, regular, and advanced circuit boards depending on the features required. For instance, a scroll wheel would require a more advanced circuit board. Speech recognition is also an option, which would require a more advanced circuit board and come at an extra cost.&#10;5. Secondary Market: The team briefly discussed creating a secondary market for selling cases for the remote device, depending on the size of the potential market.&#10;6. Fashion Trends: Marketing mentioned that fashion trends show consumers wanting &quot;fancy&quot; designs with a fruit and vegetables theme, spongy materials (contrary to last year's trend), technological innovation, and ease of use. The team agreed to emphasize a fancy design for the remote control.&#10;7. Color Schemes: There was also some discussion about using company color schemes and offering customization options like pink or red cases to appeal to different demographics." />

    <node id=" the actual um of the remote .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought" />
    <node id=" thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And second , there should be some technological innovation .

    <node id="1. Standard Battery: This is the most common option for powering remote controls. It is simple, readily available, and easy to use. However, batteries can run out and need to be replaced periodically, which could be inconvenient for users.&#10;&#10;2. Dynamo: This option involves using a small dynamo or crank to generate power for the remote. It is similar to old wind-up flashlights and could potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements. However, it may require more effort from the user and could affect the overall design of the remote.&#10;&#10;3. Kinetic Option: This option involves using motion or small movements to generate power for the remote. It is similar to new watches that are powered up by waving around. The benefit of this option is that it would not require battery replacements, and it could be more eco-friendly. However, it may require additional technology and components, which could increase the cost and complexity of the remote's design.&#10;&#10;The team seems to be leaning towards the kinetic option due to its potential benefits in terms of sustainability and ease of use." />

Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . {vocalsound} There's a dynamo .

    <node id="1. The kinetic power supply in the simple circuit board works on the principle of converting mechanical energy generated by motion into electrical energy to power up the remote control.&#10;2. This is achieved using a mechanism involving ball bearings, similar to some self-winding watches. When the remote control is moved or shaken, the internal components, including the ball bearings, move and generate power.&#10;3. The movement of these components is converted into electrical energy through an electromagnetic induction process, which involves changing the magnetic field around a coil to produce a current.&#10;4. This mechanism allows the remote control to be powered up without requiring traditional battery replacements, making it more sustainable and user-friendly in the long run.&#10;5. However, this option may require additional technology and components, potentially increasing the cost and complexity of the remote's design." />

    <node id="The industrial designer and marketing team are considering changing the appearance of the remote's casing, including the potential for different colors, while keeping its buttons and general function the same because they want to emphasize a fancy design that aligns with current fashion trends. The goal is to make the remote control more visually appealing and attractive to consumers who value technological innovation and ease of use. By offering customization options like pink or red cases, they also hope to appeal to different demographics and expand their customer base. It's worth noting that this change would not affect the logo placement, as it would still be visible and legible on every new case. Additionally, the team is exploring different power source options, such as a kinetic power supply, to make the remote control more sustainable and user-friendly in the long run." />
    <node id="The team suggests marketing their voice recognition technology as a &quot;finder function,&quot; rather than a speech function to find your remote. The reason behind this decision is that there are already very good voice recognition technologies out there, and the one they develop might not cover the same functions as leading brands do. By positioning it as a finder function, they can still highlight the technology's ability to help locate the remote control without potential shortcomings in broader speech recognition capabilities." />

This implies that the design team should consider the shape and size of the remote case to ensure they can efficiently stack together when not in use or during storage." />
    <node id=" I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But are we going f R right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah yeah . We decide . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: so would it not be best to {disfmarker} rather than {disfmarker} I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . The other way would be to do the presentation&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and then make the decision at that point in time .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um .

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, it was not explicitly stated that the project should target the biggest market. Instead, the project is focused on adapting the product for different segments in the international market. This is evident in the discussions about offering customization options like pink or red cases to appeal to different demographics and potentially creating a secondary market for selling cases. Additionally, the team is considering changing the appearance of the remote's casing to align with current fashion trends and make it more visually appealing to consumers who value technological innovation and ease of use. Overall, the goal seems to be creating a product that can appeal to various segments in the international market rather than targeting a single massive market." />

    <node id="1. Standardization of cases for easy storage: The team decided to design a standard case for the remote that allows easy stacking for retail display and inventory management.&#10;2. Company Logo: The company logo with its color scheme will be incorporated into the remote design, ensuring sufficient contrast with the casing color.&#10;3. Device Design: The remote will have two pages - a front page with popular features and a second page with backup features that meet technical requirements. It will also have 16 buttons, reduced to maintain simplicity. There is still discussion pending on the volume button design.&#10;4. Circuit Board: Different types of circuit boards with varying prices were mentioned, depending on the required features like scroll wheel or speech recognition. The team decided to use a simple circuit board initially and consider more advanced options if necessary.&#10;5. Secondary Market: A potential market for selling cases was discussed, but no final decision has been made.&#10;6. Color Schemes: Offering customization options with different color schemes, like pink or red cases, was brought up to appeal to various demographics. This idea is still under consideration.&#10;&#10;Regarding the presentation of backup features on the second page, there have not been any explicit decisions or changes mentioned in the transcripts provided. However, it is understood that the remote design will include a second page for these features to meet technical requirements." />

    <node id="1. The team is considering incorporating color into the design to make it more visually appealing and attractive to consumers who value technological innovation and ease of use. They have discussed using company color schemes and offering customization options like pink or red cases to appeal to different demographics. In a specific exchange, the project manager, marketing representative, and industrial designer discussed the possibility of using a red apple design for the remote control's casing.&#10;&#10;2. While there is an openness to incorporating a red apple design, no final decision has been made regarding this particular color scheme or its application on the button design. The team does aim to keep the button design quite simple and maintain consistency with most buttons being mainly circular or very plain in shape. The volume button's design still requires further discussion as well.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there has been some conversation about using a red apple color scheme, no definitive decisions have been made regarding this option. The team is focusing on creating a simple and visually appealing design with buttons that are easy to understand and use." />

    <node id="1. Buttons: The team discussed different designs for the volume button, as they aim to keep the button design quite simple and maintain consistency with most buttons being mainly circular or very plain in shape. They considered having &quot;volume&quot; written on the side and then up and down on the buttons themselves. The idea of using volume up and down labels on the buttons was also brought up and found to be a possible solution.&#10;2. Limited Number of Buttons: The remote will have 16 buttons, which have been reduced in number to maintain simplicity. There was some discussion about the design of the volume button, but no final decision has been made yet.&#10;3. Two Contrasting Shapes: While there is no explicit reference to two contrasting shapes in the provided transcript, it can be inferred that they were referring to the main shape of the remote control and the shape of the buttons, including the volume button. The team aims to keep the design simple, focusing on a fancy design and using company color schemes to appeal to different demographics." />
    <node id=" kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah I I know what you mean .

Limited number of buttons .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah yeah {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: 'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah we got it" />
    <node id="1. Spongy feel keys: The marketing speaker mentioned that last year's trend was different and didn't involve a spongy feel. They are unsure if the trend will change, but they believe that having a rubber case is less likely to be something consumers would end up hating quickly. The industrial designer agrees with this assessment, stating that it is less likely to go out of fashion.&#10;&#10;2. Interchangeable cases for following fashion trends: The project manager suggests that if the team wants to follow fashion trends like spongy feel keys, they would need to have interchangeable cases. This idea stems from the fact that certain design trends, such as all-fruit shaped keys, may quickly go out of style. By offering interchangeable cases, the product could adapt to new trends more easily and potentially increase customer satisfaction." />

    <node id="1. The group is discussing the possibility of using a red apple image as part of their color scheme for the remote control's casing. They have also considered other color options and customization, such as pink or red cases, to appeal to different demographics. No final decision has been made regarding the use of this specific color scheme on the button design.&#10;2. The team is aiming to keep the button design simple and consistent, with most buttons being mainly circular or very plain in shape. They have specifically discussed the volume button's design, considering options like having &quot;volume&quot; written on the side and up and down on the buttons themselves, as well as using volume up and down labels on the buttons.&#10;3. While there is no explicit reference to two contrasting shapes in the provided transcript, it can be inferred that they are referring to the main shape of the remote control and the shape of the buttons, including the volume button.

    <node id="The standby button will be in the shape of an apple. An apple shape is being considered because it is easily recognizable, and the team wants to maintain a fancy design that aligns with current fashion trends while making the remote control more visually appealing and attractive to consumers who value technological innovation and ease of use." />
    <node id="Yes, considering a specialized children's remote with limited buttons and bright colors can be a viable alternative to scroll buttons in the user interface design. This approach could cater to a specific demographic, making the remote control more appealing and user-friendly for children. However, it should be noted that the team has decided not to focus on specialist functions and remotes at this time. If pursued, this option would need to be balanced with the main goal of creating a simple and visually appealing design for the primary remote control." />
    <node id="1. Yes, there might be sufficient demand for a secondary market of selling changeable phone cases, especially among young people, as they are more likely to embrace new trends and fashionable items. This is suggested by the discussion around targeting this demographic with customization options like pink or red cases.&#10;2. It is uncertain whether users would be interested in purchasing such customizable covers based on market research findings. While some team members believe that changeable covers could be popular, others are not convinced and think that mobiles are primarily communication devices, with their appearance being less of a concern for consumers." />
    <node id=": Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .

    <node id="The team needs to consider the features required for the remote control's functions when deciding on the type of circuit board to use. A simpler circuit board may be sufficient if the remote has limited buttons and functions, while more advanced circuit boards would be needed for features like a scroll wheel or voice recognition.&#10;&#10;The user interface not sending a signal to the television is not directly related to the choice of circuit board but could potentially be caused by various issues, such as connectivity problems, compatibility issues, or power supply concerns. The team should ensure that the chosen circuit board can support all intended features and provide stable communication between the remote control and the television. Proper testing and troubleshooting are essential to identify and resolve any signal transmission issues." />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcripts, there are no proposed design changes directly related to recording and playing back a set message. The discussions revolve around the remote control's design, such as using a red apple image for the color scheme, maintaining simplicity in button shapes, standardizing cases for easy storage, and exploring customization options like pink or red cases to appeal to different demographics. While there is some talk about volume buttons, it does not involve any function related to recording and playing back messages." />
    <node id="1. Type of Circuit Board: The team needs to consider the features required for the remote's functions when deciding on the type of circuit board. A simpler circuit board may be sufficient if the remote has limited buttons and functions, while more advanced circuit boards would be needed for features like a scroll wheel or voice recognition.&#10;&#10;2. Current Issue: The issue of the device only repeating messages without sending a signal to the television is not directly related to the choice of circuit board. It could potentially be caused by various issues, such as connectivity problems, compatibility issues, or power supply concerns. Proper testing and troubleshooting are essential to identify and resolve any signal transmission issues.&#10;&#10;3. Voice Recognition Technology: The team has decided to market their voice recognition technology as a &quot;finder function&quot; rather than a speech function to find your remote. This decision will not impact the choice of circuit board, but it is important to ensure that the chosen circuit board can support this feature if implemented." />
    <node id="One design consideration for storing the devices together in a standard case, as suggested by the project manager, is to have a fairly standard case design that would allow the remotes to be stored on top of each other easily. This makes it more convenient for retail store display and inventory management." />
    <node id="1. Buttons type: The transcript does not provide clear information about whether spongy feel or rubber buttons are being considered for the design. However, it is mentioned that the team wants to keep the button design simple and consistent, with most buttons being mainly circular or very plain in shape. They have discussed different designs for the volume button but haven't made a final decision yet.&#10;   &#10;2. Shape: The transcript also does not explicitly mention any fruit or vegetable shapes being considered for the design. The standby button will be in the shape of an apple, but this is specifically stated as being the case for the standby button only, not other buttons or the overall remote control shape." />
    <node id="1. The three power supply options being considered for the remote's design are Standard Battery, Dynamo, and Kinetic. The Standard Battery is the most common option, easy to use but requires periodic replacement. The Dynamo option involves using a small dynamo or crank to generate power, similar to old wind-up flashlights. This could potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements but may require more effort from the user. The Kinetic Option involves using motion or small movements to generate power for the remote, making it more eco-friendly and not requiring battery replacements, but it may require additional technology and components, increasing cost and complexity.&#10;2. The potential benefits of the kinetic option include sustainability and ease of use, as it would not require battery replacements. It uses a mechanism involving ball bearings to generate power when the remote control is moved or shaken, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy through an electromagnetic induction process. This makes the remote control more sustainable and user-friendly in the long run." />
    <node id="1. Rubber buttons and case: The user interface (UI) expert and marketing expert have expressed that the product will have rubber buttons and case. The industrial designer clarified that if a rubber double curved case is used, rubber buttons must also be used, as they go together.&#10;2. Color scheme and logo: The UI expert mentioned that they do not know much about the color scheme or logo yet. However, the marketing expert suggested that the product could have a red apple design.&#10;3. Cost-effective circuit board: The industrial designer proposed using a simple circuit board to keep costs down, which was agreed upon by the project manager and UI expert.&#10;4. Voice recognition: The UI expert brought up the idea of incorporating voice recognition into the product without affecting the circuit board, which was accepted by the project manager.&#10;5. Curvature of the case: There was some discussion about whether to go for a single or double curve in the design. They agreed on a single curved case.&#10;6. Kinetic power supply: The industrial designer mentioned the idea of using a kinetic power supply (moving it around to generate power), which was supported by the marketing expert and project manager." />

That's the way round . If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . Which makes sense .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Rubber buttons require rubber case . {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content:" />
    <node id="1. User Interface's thoughts on fruit-shaped buttons: The User Interface (UI) team member expressed concern that making buttons fruit-shaped might make the device more complicated to use, potentially misdirecting users. They think that keeping the button design simple is crucial for ease of use.&#10;&#10;2. Project Manager's thoughts on fruit-shaped buttons: The Project Manager also cautioned about being careful with how buttons are shaped since it can easily confuse or annoy users if they have to read instructions. In this context, the Project Manager doesn't explicitly support the idea of shaping buttons in a fruit form due to concerns about potential misdirection and user frustration.&#10;&#10;3. Marketing's thoughts on fruit-shaped buttons: Although Marketing mentioned the possibility of using fruit-shaped designs like bananas or courgettes during brainstorming, they didn't explicitly state their support or opposition for this idea in terms of its impact on gadget design. The focus was more about understanding whether following trends is essential and how important it would be to cater to them with the remote control design.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, none of the team members expressed strong support for shaping buttons in fruit forms due to concerns about potential misdirection, user frustration, and the priority given to simplicity in the design process." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the industrial designer explained that if a rubber double curved case is used in the product design, then rubber buttons must also be implemented. This requirement stems from the idea that using a rubber case and buttons together would create a consistent aesthetic and user experience, as they would match visually and have similar textures. The project manager restated this point by saying &quot;Rubber buttons require rubber case,&quot; emphasizing the necessity of this design choice." />
    <node id="Based on the conversation, it appears that using rubber buttons may have a negligible impact on the overall cost compared to other button materials. However, the choice of button material does affect the choice of circuit board. The industrial designer mentions that this will be discussed in the next section, implying that there might be specific requirements or considerations for the printed circuit board based on the chosen button material. Using rubber buttons likely requires additional consideration for the seal and protection of the circuit board due to their physical properties and potential vulnerability to moisture or damage. Proper testing and selection of compatible components are essential to ensure a functional and reliable remote control design." />
    <node id="1. Standard Battery: This is the most common option and easiest to use, but it requires periodic battery replacements. The cost includes the initial purchase of batteries and future replacements.&#10;&#10;2. Dynamo (manual crank): This option involves using a small dynamo or crank to generate power, similar to old wind-up flashlights. While this could potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements, it may require more effort from the user. The cost would include manufacturing the dynamo mechanism and its integration into the remote's design.&#10;&#10;3. Kinetic Option: This option uses motion or small movements to generate power for the remote, making it more eco-friendly and not requiring battery replacements. However, it may require additional technology and components, increasing cost and complexity. The kinetic mechanism involves ball bearings that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy through an electromagnetic induction process when the remote is moved or shaken.&#10;&#10;Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, convenience, sustainability, and design complexity. The team must weigh these factors to decide which power supply option best suits their project goals and budget constraints." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript provided, it is not implied that &quot;plasticine duty&quot; (presumably a phase of product development or prototyping using Plasticine) is finished or that the project is coming to an end. The conversation revolves around various design and implementation aspects like rubber buttons, interchangeable cases, cost-effective circuit boards, voice recognition, curvature of the case, kinetic power supply, and standardization of cases for easy storage. However, there are no clear indications of the completion of any particular task or the project as a whole." />

Spongy feel keys: The marketing speaker mentioned that last year's trend was different and didn't involve a spongy feel. They are unsure if the trend will change, but they believe that having a rubber case is less likely to be something consumers would end up hating quickly. The industrial designer agrees with this assessment, stating that it is less likely to go out of fashion.&#10;&#10;2. Interchangeable cases for following fashion trends: The project manager suggests that if the team wants to follow fashion trends like spongy feel keys, they would need to have interchangeable cases. This idea stems from the fact that certain design trends, such as all-fruit shaped keys, may quickly go out of style. By offering interchangeable cases, the product could adapt to new trends more easily and potentially increase customer satisfaction.">

They considered having &quot;volume&quot; written on the side and then up and down on the buttons themselves. The idea of using volume up and down labels on the buttons was also brought up and found to be a possible solution.&#10;2. Limited Number of Buttons: The remote will have 16 buttons, which have been reduced in number to maintain simplicity. There was some discussion about the design of the volume button, but no final decision has been made yet.&#10;3. Two Contrasting Shapes: While there is no explicit reference to two contrasting shapes in the provided transcript, it can be inferred that they were referring to the main shape of the remote control and the shape of the buttons, including the volume button. The team aims to keep the design simple, focusing on a fancy design and using company color schemes to appeal to different demographics.">

They are unsure if the trend will change, but they believe that having a rubber case is less likely to be something consumers would end up hating quickly. The industrial designer agrees with this assessment, stating that it is less likely to go out of fashion.&#10;&#10;2. Interchangeable cases for following fashion trends: The project manager suggests that if the team wants to follow fashion trends like spongy feel keys, they would need to have interchangeable cases. This idea stems from the fact that certain design trends, such as all-fruit shaped keys, may quickly go out of style. By offering interchangeable cases, the product could adapt to new trends more easily and potentially increase customer satisfaction.">

Dynamo (manual crank): This option involves using a small dynamo or crank to generate power, similar to old wind-up flashlights. While this could potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements, it may require more effort from the user. The cost would include manufacturing the dynamo mechanism and its integration into the remote's design.&#10;&#10;3. Kinetic Option: This option uses motion or small movements to generate power for the remote, making it more eco-friendly and not requiring battery replacements. However, it may require additional technology and components, increasing cost and complexity. The kinetic mechanism involves ball bearings that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy through an electromagnetic induction process when the remote is moved or shaken.&#10;&#10;Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, convenience, sustainability, and design complexity. The team must weigh these factors to decide which power supply option best suits their project goals and budget constraints.">

The three power supply options being considered for the remote's design are Standard Battery, Dynamo, and Kinetic. The Standard Battery is the most common option, easy to use but requires periodic replacement. The Dynamo option involves using a small dynamo or crank to generate power, similar to old wind-up flashlights. This could potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements but may require more effort from the user. The Kinetic Option involves using motion or small movements to generate power for the remote, making it more eco-friendly and not requiring battery replacements, but it may require additional technology and components, increasing cost and complexity.&#10;2. The potential benefits of the kinetic option include sustainability and ease of use, as it would not require battery replacements. It uses a mechanism involving ball bearings to generate power when the remote control is moved or shaken, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy through an electromagnetic induction process.

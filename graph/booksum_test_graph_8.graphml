    <node id="The woman who has just entered and claimed to be Laban Tall's lawful wife is not named in the given text, but she is described as someone who never shows conjugal tenderness in public. She looks older than she claims to be, passing as thirty-five when she is actually forty. She has a shrill tongue and speaks with greater prominence of manner and tone. As for her appearance, she is described as a woman who looked five-and-twenty, but in fact, she was thirty, passed as thirty-five, and was forty.&#10;&#10;In terms of her character, the text suggests that she may not have much affection for her husband, as she does not display any conjugal tenderness towards him in public. Additionally, she seems to speak for him without giving him the opportunity to speak for himself, implying a lack of respect for his agency." />
    <node id="&quot;Now the next.  Laban Tall, you'll stay on working for me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For you or anybody that pays me well, ma'am,&quot; replied the young&#10;married man.&#10;&#10;&quot;True--the man must live!&quot; said a woman in the back quarter, who had&#10;just entered with clicking pattens.&#10;&#10;&quot;What woman is that?&quot; Bathsheba asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;I be his lawful wife!&quot; continued the voice with greater prominence&#10;of manner and tone.  This lady called herself five-and-twenty, looked&#10;thirty, passed as thirty-five, and was forty.  She was a woman who&#10;never, like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in public,&#10;perhaps because she had none to show.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, you are,&quot; said Bathsheba.  &quot;Well, Laban, will you stay on?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, he'll stay, ma'am!&quot; said again the shrill tongue of Laban's&#10;lawful wife.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, he can speak for himself, I suppose.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh Lord, not he, ma'am!

He promised to be back by&#10;six.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It wants a quarter to six at present,&quot; said Bathsheba, looking at&#10;her watch.  &quot;I daresay he'll be in directly.  Well, now then&quot;--she&#10;looked into the book--&quot;Joseph Poorgrass, are you there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir--ma'am I mane,&quot; said the person addressed.  &quot;I be the&#10;personal name of Poorgrass.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what are you?&quot;" />

There, as the others' footsteps died away he sat down&#10;again and continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red,&#10;bleared eyes.&#10;&#10;From the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba's head and&#10;shoulders, robed in mystic white, were dimly seen extended into the&#10;air.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are any of my men among you?&quot; she said anxiously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, ma'am, several,&quot; said Susan Tall's husband.&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in&#10;the villages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin.&#10;Do it quietly; there is no reason for alarm as yet.  She must have&#10;left whilst we were all at the fire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I beg yer pardon, but had she any young man courting her in the&#10;parish, ma'am?&quot; asked Jacob Smallbury.&#10;" />
    <node id=" the answer as requested,&#10;adding, however, on her own responsibility, &quot;Miss is dusting bottles,&#10;sir, and is quite a object--that's why 'tis.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said the deep voice indifferently.  &quot;All I wanted to&#10;ask was, if anything had been heard of Fanny Robin?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing, sir--but we may know to-night.  William Smallbury is gone&#10;to Casterbridge, where her young man lives, as is supposed, and the&#10;other men be inquiring about everywhere.&quot;&#10;&#10;The horse's tramp then recommenced and retreated, and the door&#10;closed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who is Mr. Boldwood?&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;A gentleman-farmer at Little Weatherbury.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Married?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, miss.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How old is he?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Forty, I should say--very handsome--rather stern-looking--and rich.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What a bother this dusting is!

    <node id=" I&#10;should be quite melancholy-like.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's yer hurry then, Laban?&quot; inquired Coggan.  &quot;You used to bide&#10;as late as the latest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she's&#10;my vocation now, and so ye see--&quot;  The young man halted lamely.&#10;&#10;&quot;New Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,&quot; remarked Coggan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, 'a b'lieve--ha, ha!&quot; said Susan Tall's husband, in a tone&#10;intended to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding&#10;them at all.  The young man then wished them good-night and withdrew.&#10;&#10;Henery Fray was the first to follow.  Then Gabriel arose and went off&#10;with Jan Coggan, who had offered him a lodging.  A few minutes later,&#10;when the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray&#10;came back again in a hurry.  Flourishing his finger ominously he&#10;threw a gaze teeming with tidings just where his eye alighted by&#10;accident, which happened" />

Well, he's turned out neck and crop, and my question is, who's&#10;going to be baily now?&quot;&#10;&#10;The question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink&#10;there and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly&#10;visible inside.  Before he had replaced it on the table, in came the&#10;young man, Susan Tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have ye heard the news that's all over parish?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About Baily Pennyways?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But besides that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--not a morsel of it!&quot; they replied, looking into the very midst&#10;of Laban Tall as if to meet his words half-way down his throat.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a night of horrors!&quot; murmured Joseph Poorgrass, waving his&#10;hands spasmodically.  &quot;I've had the news-bell ringing in my left ear&#10;quite bad enough for a murder, and I've seen a magpie all alone!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fanny Robin--Miss" />
    <node id="The motto on the seal that Bathsheba chose for her letter to Boldwood is &quot;MARRY ME.&quot; This motto is revealed when Liddy reads it aloud after Bathsheba affixes the seal to the letter. The fact that Bathsheba chooses this particular seal, without knowing what the motto says, and is then pleased when she discovers it, suggests that she may have been subconsciously thinking about proposing to Boldwood. Ultimately, the motto on the seal reveals that the contents of Bathsheba's letter to Boldwood are a bold proposal of marriage." />

Here's one with a motto--I remember it is some funny one, but&#10;I can't read it. We'll try this, and if it doesn't do we'll have&#10;another.&quot;&#10;&#10;A large red seal was duly affixed.  Bathsheba looked closely at the&#10;hot wax to discover the words.&#10;&#10;&quot;Capital!&quot; she exclaimed, throwing down the letter frolicsomely.&#10;&quot;'Twould upset the solemnity of a parson and clerke too.&quot;&#10;&#10;Liddy looked at the words of the seal, and read--&#10;&#10;&#10;   &quot;MARRY ME.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;The same evening the letter was sent, and was duly sorted in&#10;C" />

Liddy, you&#10;may as well bring me my desk and I'll direct it at once.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illuminated and embossed&#10;design in post-octavo, which had been bought on the previous&#10;market-day at the chief stationer's in Casterbridge.  In the centre&#10;was a small oval enclosure; this was left blank, that the sender&#10;might insert tender words more appropriate to the special occasion&#10;than any generalities by a printer could possibly be.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here's a place for writing,&quot; said Bathsheba.  &quot;What shall I put?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Something of this sort, I should think,&quot; returned Liddy promptly:--&#10;&#10;&#10;   &quot;The rose is red,&#10;   The violet blue,&#10;   Carnation's sweet,&#10;   And so are you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, that shall be it.

As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's&#10;money, he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for&#10;a shepherd's regulation smock-frock.&#10;&#10;This transaction having been completed, he again hurried off to the&#10;centre of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a&#10;shepherd, crook in hand.&#10;&#10;Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it seemed that&#10;bailiffs were most in demand.

Weary of standing in the market-place, and&#10;not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to, he decided&#10;to offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff.&#10;&#10;All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds.  Sheep-tending was&#10;Gabriel's speciality.  Turning down an obscure street and entering&#10;an obscurer lane, he went up to a smith's shop.&#10;&#10;&quot;How long would it take you to make a shepherd's crook?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Twenty minutes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How much?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Two shillings.&quot;&#10;&#10;He sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem being given him into&#10;the bargain.&#10;&#10;He then went to a ready-made clothes' shop, the owner of which had a&#10;large rural connection.

    <node id="In the narrative, Joseph Poorgrass found himself lost by Lambing-Down Gate one night in the middle of the night.

An owl that happened to be crying 'Whoo-whoo-whoo!' in a tree nearby startled him further.

    <node id="Bathsheba's public decision to become a farmer in her own right is shown through her actions at the fair in Casterbridge.

This public appearance and engagement in farm-related activities demonstrate Bathsheba's commitment to becoming a farmer and managing her own estate." />
    <node id=" the interest&#10;was general, and this Saturday's _debut_ in the forum, whatever it&#10;may have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer, was&#10;unquestionably a triumph to her as the maiden.  Indeed, the sensation&#10;was so pronounced that her instinct on two or three occasions was&#10;merely to walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow, like a&#10;little sister of a little Jove, and to neglect closing prices&#10;altogether.&#10;&#10;The numerous evidences of her power to attract were only thrown into&#10;greater relief by a marked exception.  Women seem to have eyes in&#10;their ribbons for such matters as these.  Bathsheba, without looking&#10;within a right angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep among the&#10;flock.&#10;&#10;It perplexed her first.  If there had been a respectable minority on&#10;either side, the case would have been most natural.  If nobody had&#10;regarded her, she would have taken the matter indifferently--such&#10;cases had occurred.

Why didn't he stop at the gate? Lord!  'Tis a&#10;gentleman!

But if she was to be the&#10;practical woman she had intended to show herself, business must&#10;be carried on, introductions or none, and she ultimately acquired&#10;confidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely known to&#10;her by hearsay.  Bathsheba too had her sample-bags, and by degrees&#10;adopted the professional pour into the hand--holding up the grains&#10;in her narrow palm for inspection, in perfect Casterbridge manner.&#10;&#10;Something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth, and&#10;in the keenly pointed" />

She scarcely knew whether most to&#10;be amused at the singularity of the meeting, or to be concerned at&#10;its awkwardness.  There was room for a little pity, also for a very&#10;little exultation: the former at his position, the latter at her own.&#10;Embarrassed she was not, and she remembered Gabriel's declaration of&#10;love to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured, putting on an air of dignity, and turning again&#10;to him with a little warmth of cheek; &quot;I do want a shepherd.  But--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He's the very man, ma'am,&quot; said one of the villagers, quietly.&#10;&#10;Conviction breeds conviction.  &quot;Ay, that 'a is,&quot; said a second,&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba purchased the valentine for little Teddy Coggan, not for Farmer Boldwood as Liddy suggested. This action can be interpreted as a way for Bathsheba to deflect attention from her complex feelings and opinions about love, which are revealed through her silent reaction to Liddy's commentary on Boldwood's behavior at church. The valentine for Teddy Coggan serves as a distraction from the romantic tension between Bathsheba and Boldwood, allowing Bathsheba to focus on other matters." />

From the walls an overhanging thatched&#10;roof sloped up to a point in the centre, upon which rose a small&#10;wooden lantern, fitted with louvre-boards on all the four sides,&#10;and from these openings a mist was dimly perceived to be escaping&#10;into the night air.

Dinner being over, Bathsheba, for want of a better&#10;companion, had asked Liddy to come and sit with her.  The mouldy pile&#10;was dreary in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the&#10;shutters closed; the atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the&#10;walls; every nook behind the furniture had a temperature of its own,&#10;for the fire was not kindled in this part of the house early in the&#10;day; and Bathsheba's new piano, which was an old one in other annals,&#10;looked particularly sloping and out of level on the warped floor&#10;before night threw a shade over its less prominent angles and hid&#10;the unpleasantness.  Liddy, like a little brook, though shallow, was&#10;always rippling; her presence had" />
    <node id=" window replied by a&#10;clang to the opening and shutting of every door, a tremble followed&#10;every bustling movement, and a creak accompanied a walker about the&#10;house, like a spirit, wherever he went.&#10;&#10;In the room from which the conversation proceeded Bathsheba and her&#10;servant-companion, Liddy Smallbury, were to be discovered sitting&#10;upon the floor, and sorting a complication of papers, books, bottles,&#10;and rubbish spread out thereon--remnants from the household stores&#10;of the late occupier.  Liddy, the maltster's great-granddaughter,&#10;was about Bathsheba's equal in age, and her face was a prominent&#10;advertisement of the light-hearted English country girl.  The beauty&#10;her features might have lacked in form was amply made up for by&#10;perfection of hue, which at this winter-time was the softened&#10;ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity that we meet with in a&#10;Terburg or a Gerard Douw; and, like the presentations of those great&#10;colourists, it was a face which kept well back from the boundary&#10;between comeliness and the ideal.

    <node id="The unusual sound of the sheep-bell signifies that something is not &quot;well in the fold.&quot; Gabriel's experienced ear recognizes that the bell's ringing, which is usually slow and intermittent, is now rapid and continuous.

    <node id=" distant, that&#10;all is well in the fold.  In the solemn calm of the awakening morn&#10;that note was heard by Gabriel, beating with unusual violence and&#10;rapidity.  This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways--by&#10;the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as when the flock&#10;breaks into new pasture, which gives it an intermittent rapidity,&#10;or by the sheep starting off in a run, when the sound has a regular&#10;palpitation.  The experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he now heard&#10;to be caused by the running of the flock with great velocity.&#10;&#10;He jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy&#10;dawn, and ascended the hill.  The forward ewes were kept apart from&#10;those among which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two&#10;hundred of the latter class in Gabriel's flock.  These two hundred&#10;seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill.  There were the&#10;fifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end as he had left&#10;them, but the rest, forming the bulk of the flock, were nowhere.&#10;Gabriel called at the top of his voice the" />
    <node id=" further necessity for his attendance on the down, he&#10;called as usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the&#10;outhouse till next morning.  Only one responded--old George; the&#10;other could not be found, either in the house, lane, or garden.&#10;Gabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill&#10;eating a dead lamb (a kind of meat he usually kept from them, except&#10;when other food ran short), and concluding that the young one had&#10;not finished his meal, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed, which&#10;latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays.&#10;&#10;It was a still, moist night.  Just before dawn he was assisted in&#10;waking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music.  To the&#10;shepherd, the note of the sheep-bell, like the ticking of the clock&#10;to other people, is a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by&#10;ceasing or altering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle&#10;twinkle which signifies to the accustomed ear, however distant, that&#10;all is well in the fold.  In the solemn calm of the awakening morn&#10;that note was heard by Gabriel, beating with unusual" />
    <node id=" remarks, a wild thought flashed&#10;into Gabriel's mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba.  There&#10;were, however, no grounds for retaining such a supposition, for the&#10;waggon, though going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be going&#10;beyond it, and the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some&#10;estate.  They were now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to&#10;alarm the speakers unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon&#10;unseen.&#10;&#10;He turned to an opening in the hedge, which he found to be a gate,&#10;and mounting thereon, he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap&#10;lodging in the village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under&#10;some hay or corn-stack.  The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon&#10;his ear.  He was about to walk on, when he noticed on his left hand&#10;an unusual light--appearing about half a mile distant.  Oak watched&#10;it, and the glow increased.  Something was on fire.&#10;&#10;Gabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side&#10;upon what he found to be ploughed soil" />
    <node id="-night to ye, shepherd.&quot;&#10;&#10;The bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as&#10;himself, went up the hill, and Oak walked on to the village, still&#10;astonished at the reencounter with Bathsheba, glad of his nearness to&#10;her, and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of&#10;Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here.  But&#10;some women only require an emergency to make them fit for one.&#10;&#10;Obliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order to find the way,&#10;he reached the churchyard, and passed round it under the wall where&#10;several ancient trees grew.  There was a wide margin of grass along&#10;here, and Gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness, even at&#10;this indurating period of the year.  When abreast of a trunk which&#10;appeared to be the oldest of the old, he became aware that a figure&#10;was standing behind it.  Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and in&#10;another moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone. The noise was&#10;enough to disturb the motionless stranger, who started and assumed" />

He descended&#10;Yalbury Hill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up&#10;under a great over-hanging tree by the roadside.&#10;&#10;On coming close, he found there were no horses attached to it, the&#10;spot being apparently quite deserted.  The waggon, from its position,&#10;seemed to have been left there for the night, for beyond about half&#10;a truss of hay which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty.&#10;Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his&#10;position.  He calculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of&#10;the journey; and having been on foot since daybreak, he felt tempted&#10;to lie down upon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the&#10;village of Weatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.&#10;&#10;Eating" />
    <node id="Gabriel Oak, disguised as a shepherd, is unable to find work while standing on the kerb of the pavement in the town's center because the farmers he talks to are wary of hiring him as a bailiff due to his current appearance and demeanor. Although Oak tries to establish trust by telling them where he comes from and that he used to own his own farm, the farmers remain skeptical and edge away after each conversation, treating him like an undesirable hire.&#10;&#10;After failing to secure work as a bailiff, Oak attempts to offer himself in some other capacity than what he had originally planned. As it turns out, all of the farmers seem to be looking for shepherds, which happens to be Oak's specialty. Despite this fortunate turn of events, Oak still cannot find employment and begins to feel disheartened.&#10;&#10;The passage suggests that Oak's inability to find work is mainly due to his appearance and the initial impression he gives off to potential employers. Furthermore, Oak's lack of a proper shepherd's crook might have also contributed to the farmers' reluctance to hire him, since he only acquires one later on in the story.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak is unable to find work as a shepherd while posing as a shepherd because of the skeptical and cautious nature of the farmers he approaches, who are uncertain about his trustworthiness and capabilities based on his appearance and initial interactions with them." />

His first&#10;feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle&#10;ewes and their unborn lambs.&#10;&#10;It was a second to remember another phase of the matter.  The&#10;sheep were not insured.  All the savings of a frugal life had been&#10;dispersed at a blow; his hopes of being an independent farmer were&#10;laid low--possibly for ever.  Gabriel's energies, patience, and&#10;industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life&#10;between eighteen and eight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of&#10;progress that no more seemed to be left in him.  He leant down upon a&#10;rail, and covered his face with his hands.&#10;&#10;Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from&#10;his.  It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one&#10;sentence he uttered was in thankfulness:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank God I am not married: what would SHE have done in the poverty&#10;now coming upon me!&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly&#10;surveyed" />

A scroll&#10;of smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling&#10;juxtaposition with the decaying one, and behind this a series of&#10;others, composing the main corn produce of the farm; so that instead&#10;of the straw-stack standing, as he had imagined comparatively&#10;isolated, there was a regular connection between it and the remaining&#10;stacks of the group.&#10;&#10;Gabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was not alone.

This could lead to Boldwood taking the declaration seriously and pursuing a courtship with her. The narrative suggests that Bathsheba is not seriously considering marrying Boldwood at this point, so his reaction might put her in an uncomfortable position.

This includes several modest demesnes, indicating that there are other similar properties in the area.&#10;2. The building's exterior features fluted pilasters, decorated chimneys, some with Gothic elements, and soft brown moss growing on the stone tiling. These details suggest that the house is no longer inhabited or maintained regularly, leading to its deteriorating condition.&#10;3. The gravel walk leading to the road has silver-green moss growing along its edges, which further highlights the neglected state of the property.&#10;4. Comparing the appearance and atmosphere of the front and back facades of the building implies that after being adapted for farming purposes, the vital principle or life of the house turned around inside its body to face the other way. This suggests a reversal in the function and possibly the fortunes of the property.&#10;5. Overall, the description indicates that the non-resident landlord's property is an old, neglected building with historical significance, situated on a larger piece of land consisting of multiple modest demesnes.

This circumstance, and the generally sleepy&#10;air of the whole prospect here, together with the animated and&#10;contrasting state of the reverse facade, suggested to the imagination&#10;that on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes the&#10;vital principle of the house had turned round inside its body to&#10;face the other way.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba Everdene is a young woman who was raised without religious education or formal schooling by her &quot;heathen&quot; parents. This upbringing has had an impact on her character, leading to some comments about how her parents' sins have affected her (though specific examples are not given in the text).&#10;&#10;When Bathsheba becomes a prosperous landowner, Mr. Fray observes that she displays a certain level of coolness and distance in her interactions with others, which he attributes to her rise in social status. Similarly, Gabriel Oak notes that Bathsheba's manner towards him is marked by a striking lack of familiarity, given their past history together.&#10;&#10;Despite this aloof demeanor, however, Bathsheba is also shown to be capable of warmth and kindness, particularly towards those in less fortunate circumstances than herself (such as her interactions with Teddy Coggan).

Noises from windows and floors: Every window and floor responded to movement and activity within the house, producing sounds such as clangs, trembles, and creaks. This suggests that the building had become neglected or was not built for heavy use, making it less suitable for farming activities.&#10;   &#10;3. Interior condition: The interior surfaces of the house were irregular, with ridges and valleys on the floors, which were further described as having &quot;eaten into innumerable vermiculations.&quot; These details imply that the building had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance and care, consistent with its new role as a farm.&#10;&#10;In summary, the adaptation of the building for farming purposes led to noticeable changes in its condition, with strange deformities, unusual noises, and a general decline in the interior surfaces' quality. These effects suggest that the house was not initially designed for agricultural use or heavy traffic, leading to its deterioration over time." />

It is unclear if this woman is Gretta Conroy or related to her in any way.&#10;3. Gabriel does not seem to have a personal connection with this family, as he admits to knowing &quot;little of her--nothing&quot; when asked about the young woman who took over her uncle's farm. There is no mention of a relationship between Gabriel and Gretta Conroy.&#10;4. The narrative excerpt does not contain any information about Gretta Conroy's new employer or her previous employment, as it focuses on Gabriel Oak's experiences and job search." />

She only showed herself a few&#10;days ago.  Her uncle was took bad, and the doctor was called with his&#10;world-wide skill; but he couldn't save the man.  As I take it, she's&#10;going to keep on the farm.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's about the shape o't, 'a b'lieve,&quot; said Jan Coggan.  &quot;Ay, 'tis&#10;a very good family.

Gabriel's fingers alighted on the young&#10;woman's wrist.  It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity.  He&#10;had frequently felt the same quick, hard beat in the femoral artery&#10;of his lambs when overdriven.  It suggested a consumption too great&#10;of a vitality which, to judge from her figure and stature, was&#10;already too little.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is the matter?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But there is?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no, no!

Good-night, again.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young girl remained motionless by the tree, and Gabriel descended&#10;into the village of Weatherbury, or Lower Longpuddle as it was&#10;sometimes called.  He fancied that he had felt himself in the&#10;penumbra of a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile&#10;creature.  But wisdom lies in moderating mere impressions, and&#10;Gab" />

Would you mind going on and leaving me?  I thank you much for&#10;what you have told me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will go on,&quot; he said; adding hesitatingly,--&quot;Since you are not&#10;very well off, perhaps you would accept this trifle from me.  It is&#10;only a shilling, but it is all I have to spare.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I will take it,&quot; said the stranger gratefully.&#10;&#10;She extended her hand; Gabriel his.

    <node id="The &quot;spot&quot; in the narrative is a woman who is the sweetheart of a soldier, referred to as the &quot;wall&quot; because he is speaking from behind a high wall. They are unable to be together at this moment because the bugle has sounded and the barrack gates are closed, meaning that the soldier is not allowed to leave the barracks. The woman, Fanny Robin, asks the soldier, Frank Troy, if he can come to her, but he explains that he cannot because he has no leave. They plan to meet the next day instead. This situation highlights the challenges and restrictions faced by couples in long-distance relationships, particularly when one partner is in the military and subject to strict rules and regulations." />

Forgive me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did not expect you to-night.  Indeed, I did not think you would&#10;come at all.  It was a wonder you found me here.

This was followed by a voice from the same quarter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who's there?&quot;&#10;&#10;The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.  The high&#10;wall being that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with&#10;disfavour in the army, assignations and communications had probably&#10;been made across the river before to-night.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it Sergeant Troy?&quot; said the blurred spot in the snow,&#10;tremulously.&#10;&#10;This person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the&#10;other speaker so much a part of the building, that one would have&#10;said the wall was holding a conversation with the snow.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; came suspiciously from the shadow. &quot;What girl are you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Frank--don't you know me?&quot; said the spot.  &quot;Your wife, Fanny&#10;Robin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fanny!&quot; said the wall, in utter astonishment" />
    <node id="The young man that the woman from Casterbridge is being coy about is Fanny Robin's sweetheart. Bathsheba feels more responsible for Fanny's safety because Fanny is one of her servants, and she has no friends or relatives alive to look after her. This sense of responsibility is heightened due to the recent disgraceful affair involving Baily Pennyways, her former bailiff, who has stolen five sacks of corn and fled the area. Bathsheba's concern for Fanny's well-being demonstrates her compassionate nature and her commitment to taking care of those under her charge." />
    <node id=" I think, a bundle, though I couldn't see very well,&quot; said a&#10;female voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann.  &quot;But&#10;she had no young man about here.

And then&#10;there's this disgraceful affair of the bailiff--but I can't speak of&#10;him now.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did&#10;not think it worth while to dwell upon any particular one.  &quot;Do as I&#10;told you, then,&quot; she" />
    <node id="Bathsheba chooses a seal with the motto &quot;MARRY ME&quot; for her letter to Boldwood, which unintentionally conveys a proposal of marriage to him. This choice of motto reveals that Bathsheba might have been subconsciously thinking about proposing to Boldwood, but she is not seriously considering marrying him at this point in the narrative. The selection of this seal serves as a distraction from the romantic tension between Bathsheba and Boldwood, allowing her to focus on other matters." />
    <node id="The feminine figure in the room of heavy yeomen is Bathsheba Everdene's aunt, who is described as prettily and even daintily dressed.

    <node id=" exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at&#10;opportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation&#10;does not prompt to enterprise.&#10;&#10;The scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river,&#10;behind which rose a high wall.  On the right was a tract of land,&#10;partly meadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a&#10;wide undulating upland.&#10;&#10;The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this&#10;kind than amid woodland scenery.  Still, to a close observer, they&#10;are just as perceptible; the difference is that their media of&#10;manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well-known ones&#10;as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf.

    <node id="Joseph Poorgrass has been suffering from excessive blushing since he was a boy. His friends and family have attempted various methods to cure him of this affliction, such as taking him to Greenhill Fair and having him work at the Women's Skittle Alley. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. Joseph continues to blush profusely whenever he is in the presence of attractive women or feels embarrassed.&#10;&#10;Jacob Smallbury views Joseph's affliction with a mix of pity and curiosity. He sees it as an interesting study and acknowledges that it must be difficult for Joseph, who has not even been able to look at Bathsheba, their young mistress, without blushing profusely. Despite this, Jacob also seems to think that Joseph's blushing is a sign of his modesty and goodness, which makes him deserving of sympathy and understanding.&#10;&#10;Overall, these attempts to cure Joseph's blushing have not been successful, but they serve as a way for the community to bond over shared experiences and demonstrate their care and concern for one another. Jacob's response to Joseph's affliction also highlights the importance of empathy and acceptance in building strong relationships and communities." />

    <node id="Based on Frank and his fiancée's conversation, there are a few steps they need to take to get married:&#10;&#10;1. They need to put up the banns in both of their parishes, as they live in two different ones. The banns are a public announcement of their intention to marry, which is read out loud in church on three consecutive Sundays. This allows anyone who knows of any reason why the marriage should not take place to come forward and object.&#10;2. They need to obtain permission from the officers, as Frank is a soldier and may be subject to certain regulations or restrictions regarding marriage.&#10;3. Fanny mentions that she has money, so it seems they are able to afford the cost of a wedding. However, she also brings up the need for her to get proper clothes for the occasion.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that their conversation takes place in the context of the time period and location (19th century England), where there were certain legal requirements and social conventions around marriage. For example, the requirement to publish banns or obtain a license, and the expectation that a bride would have appropriate clothing for the occasion." />

While their names are not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that they have joined the military effort in some capacity. Bathsheba makes plans to send someone to Casterbridge barracks to find out more information about Fanny's sweetheart and his regiment. Later on, it is revealed that Gabriel Oak had been trying to find work as a shepherd since he was no longer needed as a bailiff at the farm, but this does not seem to be related to the war effort." />

This suggestion comes from Henery Fray, who praises Cain Ball as a good lad and implies that he would be a suitable choice for the position.

Overall, the description indicates that the non-resident landlord's property is an old, neglected building with historical significance, situated on a larger piece of land consisting of multiple modest demesnes. The state of the house implies that it may have once been a thriving estate but has since fallen into disrepair due to the absence of its owner and lack of proper maintenance.">

His friends and family have attempted various methods to cure him of this affliction, such as taking him to Greenhill Fair and having him work at the Women's Skittle Alley. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. Joseph continues to blush profusely whenever he is in the presence of attractive women or feels embarrassed.&#10;&#10;Jacob Smallbury views Joseph's affliction with a mix of pity and curiosity. He sees it as an interesting study and acknowledges that it must be difficult for Joseph, who has not even been able to look at Bathsheba, their young mistress, without blushing profusely. Despite this, Jacob also seems to think that Joseph's blushing is a sign of his modesty and goodness, which makes him deserving of sympathy and understanding.&#10;&#10;Overall, these attempts to cure Joseph's blushing have not been successful, but they serve as a way for the community to bond over shared experiences and demonstrate their care and concern for one another. Jacob's response to Joseph's affliction also highlights the importance of empathy and acceptance in building strong relationships and communities.">

They need to put up the banns in both of their parishes, as they live in two different ones. The banns are a public announcement of their intention to marry, which is read out loud in church on three consecutive Sundays. This allows anyone who knows of any reason why the marriage should not take place to come forward and object.&#10;2. They need to obtain permission from the officers, as Frank is a soldier and may be subject to certain regulations or restrictions regarding marriage.&#10;3. Fanny mentions that she has money, so it seems they are able to afford the cost of a wedding. However, she also brings up the need for her to get proper clothes for the occasion.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that their conversation takes place in the context of the time period and location (19th century England), where there were certain legal requirements and social conventions around marriage. For example, the requirement to publish banns or obtain a license, and the expectation that a bride would have appropriate clothing for the occasion.">

Noises from windows and floors: Every window and floor responded to movement and activity within the house, producing sounds such as clangs, trembles, and creaks. This suggests that the building had become neglected or was not built for heavy use, making it less suitable for farming activities.&#10;   &#10;3. Interior condition: The interior surfaces of the house were irregular, with ridges and valleys on the floors, which were further described as having &quot;eaten into innumerable vermiculations.&quot; These details imply that the building had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance and care, consistent with its new role as a farm.&#10;&#10;In summary, the adaptation of the building for farming purposes led to noticeable changes in its condition, with strange deformities, unusual noises, and a general decline in the interior surfaces' quality.

This sense of responsibility is heightened due to the recent disgraceful affair involving Baily Pennyways, her former bailiff, who has stolen five sacks of corn and fled the area. Bathsheba's concern for Fanny's well-being demonstrates her compassionate nature and her commitment to taking care of those under her charge.">

The mouldy pile&#10;was dreary in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the&#10;shutters closed; the atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the&#10;walls; every nook behind the furniture had a temperature of its own,&#10;for the fire was not kindled in this part of the house early in the&#10;day; and Bathsheba's new piano, which was an old one in other annals,&#10;looked particularly sloping and out of level on the warped floor&#10;before night threw a shade over its less prominent angles and hid&#10;the unpleasantness.

The non-resident landlord's property is an old, possibly historic building with features of the Early Stage of Classic Renaissance architecture. It might have originally been a memorial hall on a small estate that has since been merged into a larger tract of land owned by the absentee landlord. This includes several modest demesnes, indicating that there are other similar properties in the area.&#10;2. The building's exterior features fluted pilasters, decorated chimneys, some with Gothic elements, and soft brown moss growing on the stone tiling. These details suggest that the house is no longer inhabited or maintained regularly, leading to its deteriorating condition.&#10;3. The gravel walk leading to the road has silver-green moss growing along its edges, which further highlights the neglected state of the property.&#10;4. Comparing the appearance and atmosphere of the front and back facades of the building implies that after being adapted for farming purposes, the vital principle or life of the house turned around inside its body to face the other way. This suggests a reversal in the function and possibly the fortunes of the property.&#10;5. Overall, the description indicates that the non-resident landlord's property is an old, neglected building with historical significance, situated on a larger piece of land consisting of multiple modest demesnes. The state of the house implies that it may have once been a thriving estate but has since fallen into disrepair due to the absence of its owner and lack of proper maintenance.">

This allows anyone who knows of any reason why the marriage should not take place to come forward and object.&#10;2.

Swarts is giving Maitland various tests, one of which involves reciting words to gauge semantic reactions.

Swarts has an interest in Maitland because he wants to go to the Moon, and Swarts aims to understand his motivations behind it.&#10;5. The girl who brings Maitland's meal is of mixed Oriental and Caucasian descent, which contributes to Maitland's confusion about the location, as this combination is unusual in most places around the world." />
    <node id="&#10; Where was he?&#10; &#10; Who was Swarts?&#10; &#10; What was the purpose of the &quot;tests&quot; he was being given?&#10; &#10; It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme for getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the contrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been nothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from foreign intelligence officers.&#10; &#10; It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at the Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to think of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be cultivated, not allowed to go to grass.&#10; &#10; This might be somewhere in Africa....&#10; &#10; He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued glow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get hold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away. After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue, a backdrop for a pure white" />
    <node id="lessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the laboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach the instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started saying a list of words—doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction test—Maitland began the job of integrating &quot;csc&#10; 3&#10; x dx&quot; in his head. It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent tracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts had stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man standing over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.&#10; &#10; &quot;What year is this?&quot; Maitland asked in a conversational tone.&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll try another series of tests.&quot;&#10; &#10; It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He lowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks of a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at the ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's eyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.&#10; &#10; &quot;These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,&quot; he said." />

Cables from them ran across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the center of the room.&#10; &#10; &quot;Lie down,&quot; Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,&#10;&quot;Understand one thing—the more you cooperate, the easier things will be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results against your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the idea?&quot; Maitland asked. &quot;What is all this?&quot;&#10; &#10; Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an answer, but to find the proper words. &quot;You can think of it as a lie detector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I give you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed muscles. &quot;Make me.&quot;&#10; &#10; If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. &quot;That was the first test,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me put it another way.

    <node id=" If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. &quot;That was the first test,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if you'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maitland shook his head stubbornly.&#10; &#10; &quot;I see,&quot; Swarts said. &quot;You want to find out what you're up against.&quot;&#10; &#10; He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the solar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath. He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on the cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across his chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a clamp that held his head immovable.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and to other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to the skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung from the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around his left upper arm," />

A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around his left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box clamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined the others.&#10; &#10; So—Maitland thought—Swarts could record changes in his skin potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of the body to stimuli.&#10; &#10; The question was, what were the stimuli to be?&#10; &#10; &quot;Your name,&quot; said Swarts, &quot;is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four years old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly as applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to question you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is Madison, Wisconsin....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You seem to know everything about me,&quot; Maitland said defiantly, looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. &quot;Why this recital?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I do not know everything about you—yet. And I'm testing the equipment, calibrating it to your reactions.&quot; He went on, &quot;Your favorite" />

Maitland, how would you like to go to the Moon ?&quot;&#10; &#10; Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and he tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; Swarts was chuckling. &quot;I really hit a semantic push-button there, didn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants to go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out why .&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid aside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for several seconds.&#10; &#10; She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that glowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of blonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless blouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of the experiment being conducted on Maitland is to understand his motivations for wanting to go to the Moon. Swarts is testing various aspects of Maitland's mental and physical reactions, including a semantic reaction test, recording changes in skin potential, heartbeat, blood pressure, and other involuntary responses to stimuli.&#10;2. Maitland was integrating 'csc 3 x dx' in his head during the process as a way to concentrate and block out the distractions around him, as this calculation requires great concentration and frequent tracing back of steps. This mental exercise helped Maitland maintain his composure and resist compliance with Swarts' requests until he better understood the situation." />
    <node id=" His mind had just manufactured a discouraging analogy. His present position was like that of an earnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into the year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan movement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue in vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the infidel....&#10; &#10; Maitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with troubled eyes. &quot;I think I'd like to be alone for a while,&quot; he said." />
    <node id=" when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in any way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that we want your childish secrets about rocket motors.&quot; Maitland's heart jumped. &quot;My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I want to give you some psychological tests....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you crazy?&quot; Maitland asked quietly. &quot;Do you realize that at this moment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll admit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here—but it seems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give your tests to.&quot;&#10; &#10; Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. &quot;They won't find you,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, come with me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather commonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and a bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple of them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal complement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the center" />
    <node id="The man, Maitland, is desperate to reach Mars because it has been his lifelong dream and ambition. He had hoped that in traveling through time, he would finally have the chance to visit the planet. In his time, humans have not yet reached Mars, but Maitland was certain that they would eventually do so. The idea of exploring new worlds and discovering the unknown is deeply ingrained in him, representing the spirit of adventure and curiosity. When he learns that people in this future time have no interest in visiting the planets, despite their advanced technology, he feels devastated and defeated. He believes that the opportunity to reach Mars has slipped away from him forever." />
    <node id=" any more.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Robot factories and farms,&quot; Maitland mused. &quot;What else? What means of transportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Inter-what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have men visited the stars?&quot;&#10; &#10; She shook her head, bewildered.&#10; &#10; &quot;I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,&quot; he agreed.&#10;&quot;But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?&quot;&#10; &#10; He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. &quot;I don't understand. Mars? What are Mars?&quot;&#10; &#10; After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the matter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. &quot;Surely you have space travel?&quot;&#10; &#10; She frowned and shook her head. &quot;What does that mean—space travel?&quot;&#10; &#10; He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. &quot;A civilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories wouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A ship ? Oh, you mean something" />
    <node id=" now I know I never will.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders and fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes and looked at her. &quot;I just don't understand,&quot; he said. &quot;It seemed obvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd do it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he was facing her. &quot;I've got to understand. I've got to know why . What happened? Why don't men want the planets any more?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Honestly,&quot; she said, &quot;I did not know they ever had.&quot; She hesitated.&#10;&quot;Maybe you are asking the wrong question.&quot;&#10; &#10; He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.&#10; &#10; &quot;I mean,&quot; she explained, &quot;maybe you should ask why people in the 20th Century did want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maitland felt his face become hot. &quot;Men can go anywhere, if they want to bad enough.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why ?&quot;&#10; &#10; Despite his sudden irrational anger toward" />

Why, no, I don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?&quot;&#10; &#10; He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her arms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. &quot;Let's get this perfectly clear,&quot; he said, more harshly than he realized. &quot;So far as you know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is that right?&quot;&#10; &#10; She nodded apprehensively. &quot;I have never heard of it being done.&quot;&#10; &#10; He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he looked up and said bitterly, &quot;You're looking at a man who would give his life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I would when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders and fingers" />
    <node id=". I still do not feel that I belong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Even,&quot; he said, &quot;granting that you have solved the population problem, there's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must be men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in your blood, the idea of going to Mars—just to go there and see what's there and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested in finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of Venus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance of only two hundred thousand miles?&quot; His hands were trembling as he stopped.&#10; &#10; She shrugged her shapely shoulders. &quot;Go into the past—yes! But go out there? I still cannot see why.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Has the spirit of adventure evaporated from the human race, or what ?&quot;&#10; &#10; She smiled. &quot;In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion.

He didn't have to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was. Those questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the psychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what they purported to be.&#10; &#10; Only one question of importance remained:&#10; &#10; What year was this?&#10; &#10; He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of jubilation and excitement. The future ! Here was the opportunity for the greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.&#10; &#10; Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering cities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets. Somewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked beside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of Venus—somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars and returned.

Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel could reach the stars!&#10; &#10; And he had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the challenging spaceways between the solar worlds.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm adaptable,&quot; he told himself gleefully. &quot;I can learn fast. There'll be a job for me out there....&quot;&#10;  If—&#10; &#10; &#10; Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a way of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man realize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still wouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The fellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results, but—&#10; &#10; After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He rolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his" />
    <node id="1. The only significant question remaining for the person (Maitland) in this scenario is &quot;What year is this?&quot; Now that he no longer has to worry about military secrets or the identity of Swarts, he is contemplating the opportunity for adventure in a civilization that has developed time travel. His lifelong dream has been to visit Mars, and he wants to find out if people in this future time have already done so or if he can be part of the exploration of space." />
    <node id="The significance of people being more important than gadgets in the current age is that they have shifted their focus from technological advancements to understanding and developing human potential. This is reflected in the way their scientists study human reactions rather than nuclear ones, and are more interested in the life and death of cultures than the expansion or contraction of the universe.&#10;&#10;When Maitland, a 12th-century crusader, finds himself in this time period, he realizes that his situation is similar to an earnest crusader who has been transported to the year 1950 and is trying to revive the anti-Mohammedan movement. Just as the knight would argue in vain about using atomic bombs to destroy the infidel, Maitland feels out of place because he cannot relate to the current civilization's focus on human development rather than space exploration and technological advancements.&#10;&#10;In essence, the story highlights that despite being from different time periods, both the 12th-century crusader and Maitland struggle to adapt to a culture with vastly different values and priorities than their own." />

    <node id="1. Based on the story, it appears that there is no development of interstellar travel or exploration of other planets in the Solar System in this future time. When Maitland asks about interstellar flight and visiting Mars and Venus, the woman he is speaking to looks puzzled and has never heard of such things.&#10;2. The only means of transportation that is explicitly mentioned in the story is something called a &quot;vliegvlotter,&quot; which the woman describes as a type of boat used for fishing in Maitland's time. It is unclear whether this is the primary or only form of transportation in this future society.&#10;3. The focus of the society seems to be on maintaining and improving their robot factories and farms, rather than exploring space. This may be due to a lack of interest or resources devoted to space travel, or perhaps there are other challenges or priorities that have taken precedence over interstellar exploration.&#10;4. It is also worth noting that the society in this future time has undergone significant changes in terms of race and ethnicity, with intermarriage leading to a blending of European and Asian characteristics and the elimination of distinct racial categories. This may reflect a different set of values and priorities than those that existed in Maitland's time, which could in turn influence the development and focus of transportation technology." />

It might have been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. &quot;The Pan-Orientals eventually conquered all the world, except for North America—the last remnant of the American World Empire—and southern Africa. The Afrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and they had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it.

    <node id="The story suggests that Maitland is in a different time period than expected, specifically in the future. The fact that Venus is visible as an evening star after it was not there the previous night can be attributed to this change in time. In the story, there is a mention of Venus changing from being a morning star to an evening star, which is its normal cycle in the sky, taking about 500 days to complete. However, Maitland's realization that it was missing the previous night suggests that he may have experienced a &quot;time slip&quot; or time travel, causing him to skip a day and observe Venus on its next scheduled evening appearance.

You mean you don't know?&quot;&#10; &#10; She shook her head. &quot;I cannot tell you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right; we'll let it go at that.&quot;&#10; &#10; She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned offensive.&#10; &#10; &quot;What year is this?&quot;&#10; &#10; Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. &quot;You know what the date is,&quot; he stated.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, I don't. Not since yesterday.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Come on,&quot; Swarts said patiently, &quot;let's get going. We have a lot to get through this morning.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century. Venus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an evening star.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind that. Come.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the laboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach the instruments," />
    <node id=" &#10; That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes whistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering one leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme over and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant mounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.&#10; &#10; He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis Major; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn. In his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright globe against the constellations....&#10; &#10; Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray of food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and revealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think you are wonderful,&quot; she laughed. &quot;You get everything you want, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little of what I want from him." />
    <node id="1. The reason why the woman wants to travel back to the 20th century is because she has a romantic nature and finds far times and places more exciting. She also mentions that Swarts, possibly a figure of authority or a scientist, believes she hasn't adapted well to modern culture, implying that she may find it difficult to connect with the values and priorities of this future society. The blending of cultures in her background due to historical events involving Pan-Orientals overrunning Europe five hundred years earlier may have also contributed to her difficulty in adapting to modern culture.&#10;2. In this future time, there is no development of interstellar travel or exploration of other planets in the Solar System. The society seems to be focused on maintaining and improving their robot factories and farms, rather than exploring space. This focus on different priorities may have contributed to the woman's desire to return to the 20th century. Additionally, there are significant changes in terms of race and ethnicity in this future time, with intermarriage leading to a blending of European and Asian characteristics and the elimination of distinct racial categories. This may reflect a different set of values and priorities than those that existed in Maitland's time, which could in turn influence the development and focus of transportation technology.&#10;&#10;In summary, the woman wants to travel back to the 20th century due to her romantic nature and interest in far times and places. She may have found it difficult to adapt to modern culture due to differences in values and priorities, as well as her unique cultural background resulting from historical events." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, it appears that there is no development of interstellar travel or exploration of other planets in the Solar System in this future time. When Maitland asks about interstellar flight and visiting Mars and Venus, the woman he is speaking to looks puzzled and has never heard of such things.&#10;2. The only means of transportation that is explicitly mentioned in the story is something called a &quot;vliegvlotter,&quot; which the woman describes as a type of boat used for fishing in Maitland's time. It is unclear whether this is the primary or only form of transportation in this future society.&#10;3. The focus of the society seems to be on maintaining and improving their robot factories and farms, rather than exploring space. This may be due to a lack of interest or resources devoted to space travel, or perhaps there are other challenges or priorities that have taken precedence over interstellar exploration.&#10;4. It is also worth noting that the society in this future time has undergone significant changes in terms of race and ethnicity, with intermarriage leading to a blending of European and Asian characteristics and the elimination of distinct racial categories. This may reflect a different set of values and priorities than those that existed in Maitland's time, which could in turn influence the development and focus of transportation technology.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on the story provided, it is unclear what the primary means of transportation are in this future society, as only one type (the &quot;vliegvlotter&quot;) is explicitly mentioned. There does not appear to be any development of interstellar travel or exploration of other planets in the Solar System. The focus of the society seems to be on maintaining and improving their robot factories and farms, rather than exploring space. This may reflect a lack of interest or resources devoted to space travel, as well as a different set of values and priorities resulting from historical events that have shaped this future society." />

He observes that the sun sets as a red spheroid, and the prairie is not cultivated, which are unusual characteristics for most regions in the world.&#10;&#10;2. Swarts is a man who has brought Maitland to this mysterious location with the purpose of understanding his motivations for wanting to go to the Moon. He conducts various tests on Maitland, such as a semantic reaction test and recording changes in skin potential, heartbeat, blood pressure, and other involuntary responses to stimuli. Swarts is particularly interested in Maitland's fascination with going to the Moon.&#10;&#10;3. The significance of the tests being given to Maitland is to understand his motivations for wanting to go to the Moon. Swarts uses various methods to gauge Maitland's reactions, including a semantic reaction test and monitoring changes in his physical responses using specialized equipment. These tests help Swarts learn more about Maitland and his desires while also allowing him to calibrate and test his equipment." />
    <node id="1. The speaker suggests that exploring outer space, specifically visiting Mars, is a great adventure, as it has been Maitland's lifelong dream and ambition. However, when Maitland learns that people in this future time have no interest in visiting the planets, despite their advanced technology, he feels devastated.&#10;2. The listener, on the other hand, prefers time traveling because she finds far times and places more exciting. She has a romantic nature and wants to return to the 20th century, possibly because she hasn't adapted well to modern culture or finds it difficult to connect with its values and priorities.&#10;3. The listener's preference for time traveling over exploring outer space may be due to her interest in different times and places, rather than the technological advancements required for space travel. She may also find more excitement and adventure in experiencing different historical periods and cultures firsthand." />
    <node id="1. The man's excitement is primarily due to his lifelong dream and ambition of exploring outer space, particularly reaching Mars. This is evident in his behavior when waiting for the woman, as he paces around the room, snaps his fingers, sits down and jitters one leg while whistling a theme from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The Ninth Symphony is often associated with themes of joy, triumph, and brotherhood, reflecting Maitland's anticipation and excitement about the prospect of visiting Mars.&#10;2. His excitement is further demonstrated through his vivid mental images of exploring space: picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis Major, viewing Venus, Saturn, Earth from the Moon, and circling the Moon. These visions reinforce Maitland's passion for space exploration.&#10;3. The woman bringing him food and expressing admiration for his ability to get what he wants further fuels his excitement. He sees her as an opportunity to learn about this new time and understand why men in this era no longer share his dream of exploring the planets." />
    <node id="Based on the story, tomorrow Maitland plans to find a way of breaking down Swarts' reluctance to share information about time travel. He intends to make Swarts realize that secrecy isn't necessary in this case and that he can force the issue if Swarts still won't talk. Maitland believes that a civilization capable of developing time travel could have already reached the stars, and he wants to be part of that exploration." />
    <node id="The speakers in the text believe that the current Age of Man, where there is a greater focus on human reactions and cultures, is more fascinating than the previous Age of Technology which was filled with machines and gadgets. This is evident in the woman's preference for time traveling over exploring outer space, as she finds different times and places more exciting than technological advancements. Similarly, Maitland feels out of place in this future society that values human development over space exploration and technological advancements. The story highlights how both speakers have adapted to and prefer the current age's focus on understanding and developing human potential." />

The mysterious material that makes up the seemingly invisible window in the room is not explicitly named in the story, but it is described as a &quot;hard sheet of stuff so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence.&quot; It is stated to be not glass, as glass is never this clear. This material's transparency and strength make it difficult for Maitland to notice or suspect its presence until he physically bumps into it.&#10;2. Maitland injures himself when trying to look outside because of the complete clarity and invisibility of the window. Since he doesn't realize there is a transparent barrier in front of him, he misjudges the distance to the window ledge and ends up forcefully colliding with the material." />

Even after allowances were made for the outlandish design, something about the room still was not right.&#10; &#10; His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer one. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this one, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He pressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at the disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.&#10; &#10; There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of causing it to open.&#10; &#10; Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window—and realized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.&#10; &#10; It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....&#10; &#10; Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently banged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass!

Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his eyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from the open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination of the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.&#10; &#10; What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come from within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a chair, or—&#10; &#10; Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room.

The man, Maitland, is eager to explore Mars and hopes that people in this future time have already done so or if he can be part of the exploration of space." />
    <node id="The story suggests that Maitland's uncontrollable rage was caused by a combination of factors. First, his frustration with Swarts' reluctance to share information about time travel, which Maitland believes could be key to exploring space and fulfilling his lifelong dream. This frustration is exacerbated by Swarts' adherence to &quot;silly rules&quot; that prevent him from disclosing this information.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the story mentions two specific triggers for Maitland's rage: a memory of a bully who had beaten him up in the past and a talk he had heard by a politican who displayed a lack of intelligence or social responsibility. These memories may have tapped into Maitland's feelings of powerlessness and frustration, contributing to his uncontrollable rage.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that Maitland's rage was a complex emotional response triggered by a mix of frustration, anger, and past traumas." />
    <node id=" but shortly the muscles around them declared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.&#10; &#10; Now he was looking at a girl. She....&#10; &#10; Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.&#10; &#10; He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day after school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had all the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no more. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of Swarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this new world.&#10; &#10; Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened against the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his forehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....&#10; &#10; The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside. There was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.&#10; &#10; The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his eyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of the experiment being conducted on Maitland is to calibrate and test Swarts' equipment using various tests, including a semantic reaction test and monitoring changes in Maitland's physical responses such as skin potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure.&#10;2. Swarts uses a bulky apparatus with cylindrical tubes and eyelash clamps to conduct a visual test on Maitland. The lenses at the ends of the tubes are placed about half an inch from Maitland's eyes, and tiny clamps are attached to his eyelashes to keep him from closing his eyes during the test." />
    <node id="Question: What is Maitland's purpose in planning to confront Swarts, and what is he trying to figure out about their location and the tests being administered to him?&#10;&#10;Maitland intends to confront Swarts to make him reveal the secret of time travel, believing that secrecy is unnecessary. If Swarts still refuses to talk, Maitland threatens to force the issue. Maitland's curiosity and lifelong dream of exploring space drive him to seek information about this future civilization and their potential achievements in reaching the stars through time travel.&#10;&#10;In terms of their location, Maitland is trying to understand where he is, as it does not resemble any military establishment he knows of. He observes unique terrain, including a prairie that isn't cultivated, which reminds him of certain regions in Africa. The sun sets as a red spheroid, adding to his confusion about the exact location.&#10;&#10;Regarding the tests being given to him by Swarts, Maitland is contemplating their purpose and connection to military secrets or foreign intelligence officers. He undergoes various tests, such as a semantic reaction test and involuntary response monitoring, which aim to understand his motivations for wanting to go to the Moon." />
    <node id="1. The context of Maitland's situation is that he has been brought to an unknown location by a man named Swarts for tests related to Maitland's desire to go to the Moon. Maitland suspects it might be a ruse for obtaining military secrets but finds no evidence to support this theory.&#10;2. Given Maitland's observations about the unique terrain and the position of the setting Sun, he speculates that he could be in some region of Africa. The prairie is not cultivated as he would expect in most parts of the world, and the sun sets as a red spheroid, which is unusual. However, the exact location remains uncertain." />

She mentions that Swarts believes she hasn't adapted well to modern culture, implying that she may find it difficult to connect with the values and priorities of this future society. Additionally, her unique cultural background resulting from historical events involving Pan-Orientals overrunning Europe five hundred years earlier may also contribute to her difficulty in adapting to modern culture.&#10;2. The woman is from Aresund, a fishing village in what Maitland would call Norway, but she has a mix of Oriental and European features due to historical events involving Pan-Orientals overrunning Europe five hundred years earlier. This blending of cultures may have caused her difficulty in adapting to modern culture in the future society." />

They used their advanced technology to send Maitland into the future as part of their tests related to space travel. The unfamiliar environment is a result of this time jump.&#10;2. Maitland tries to figure out where he is by observing the unique terrain and the position of the setting sun. He speculates that he could be in some region of Africa due to the prairie not being cultivated, which is unusual for most parts of the world, and the sun setting as a red spheroid, something he hasn't seen before. However, he remains uncertain about their exact location.&#10;3. The tests Maitland undergoes, such as the semantic reaction test and involuntary response monitoring, aim to understand his motivations for wanting to go to the Moon, with Swarts possibly evaluating if Maitland poses any threat to national security or foreign intelligence officers." />
    <node id="1. The Afrikanders were a group of people from South Africa who developed advanced technology while the rest of the world lost it during their isolation for several centuries.&#10;2. They had a tradition of white supremacy and were terrified of being encircled, which led them to conquer the world with their armies of invincible killing-machines, resulting in the War of Annihilation where one and a half billion human beings were destroyed.&#10;3. After the war, the Afrikanders founded modern civilization, using robots for food production and manufacturing. This allowed the population to be reduced to three hundred million.&#10;4. However, there are no more Afrikanders today due to intermarriage and racial blending, as a psychology of guilt led them to expiate their huge crime through this means.&#10;5. Despite their historical significance, the Afrikanders no longer exist as a separate race, with only Afrikaans remaining as the world language." />
    <node id="1. The woman suggests that Maitland may be asking the wrong question. Instead of wondering why people in the 20th Century wanted to go to worlds that humans are not suited to inhabit, he should consider why people in this future time find different times and places more fascinating than exploring outer space. This indicates a shift in values and priorities between the two periods, with the current age placing greater emphasis on understanding and developing human potential rather than technological advancements.&#10;2. The reason men no longer seem to have an interest in reaching the planets is that their focus has changed over time. In Maitland's time, there may have been a strong desire for space exploration due to the spirit of adventure and curiosity. However, in this future society, people prefer to explore different times and places through time travel, as they find it more exciting and fulfilling than technological advancements. This shift in priorities has resulted in a lack of interest in visiting the planets, despite having advanced technology that could make it possible." />
    <node id="1. An earnest 12th Century crusader, if deposited into 1950 and trying to rekindle the anti-Mohammedan movement, would not have a good chance of success. This is because the context and values of the time have significantly changed. In the 1950s, people were more focused on human development rather than religious or ideological conflicts, especially in comparison to a medieval crusade. Furthermore, nuclear technology had taken over as a major concern, making it difficult for someone from the 12th century to communicate effectively about their cause.&#10;&#10;2. Maitland relates this analogy to his own desire for solitude because he is feeling overwhelmed and out of place in this future time. Just like the 12th-century crusader trying to rekindle an old conflict, Maitland's lifelong dream of visiting Mars seems impossible in this civilization that has no interest in exploring space. He feels isolated in his values and priorities, making him want some time alone to process these feelings." />

Maitland swore at him for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was starting to ache from the effort of blinking.&#10; &#10; &quot;What year is this?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Swarts said. &quot;A.D. 2634.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maitland's smile became a grin.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,&quot; Swarts said a while later. &quot;Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit. If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.&quot;'&#10; &#10; &quot;Ching?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector to his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.&#10; &#10; That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room," />
    <node id="1. Maitland's lifelong dream and ambition have been to reach Mars and explore outer space, representing the spirit of adventure and curiosity within him. He had hoped that in traveling through time, he would finally have the chance to visit the planet. The idea of exploring new worlds and discovering the unknown is deeply ingrained in him.&#10;2. Despite learning that people in this future time have no interest in visiting the planets, Maitland feels devastated and defeated because he believes that the opportunity to reach Mars has slipped away from him forever. He cannot fathom a civilization capable of discovering time travel but not utilizing it for space exploration.&#10;3. The woman's revelation that no one has ever visited the planets is particularly disappointing for Maitland, as he had envisioned a future where humanity had already established itself in the Solar System. He is eager to learn about and experience this aspect of human progress but finds himself in a time where such advancements have not yet occurred." />

Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been nothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from foreign intelligence officers.&#10; &#10; It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at the Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to think of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be cultivated, not allowed to go to grass.&#10; &#10; This might be somewhere in Africa....&#10; &#10; He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued glow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get hold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.

It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent tracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts had stopped calling words.

An earnest 12th Century crusader, if deposited into 1950 and trying to rekindle the anti-Mohammedan movement, would not have a good chance of success. This is because the context and values of the time have significantly changed.

Furthermore, nuclear technology had taken over as a major concern, making it difficult for someone from the 12th century to communicate effectively about their cause.&#10;&#10;2. Maitland relates this analogy to his own desire for solitude because he is feeling overwhelmed and out of place in this future time. Just like the 12th-century crusader trying to rekindle an old conflict, Maitland's lifelong dream of visiting Mars seems impossible in this civilization that has no interest in exploring space.

An earnest 12th Century crusader, if deposited into 1950 and trying to rekindle the anti-Mohammedan movement, would not have a good chance of success. This is because the context and values of the time have significantly changed.

Furthermore, nuclear technology had taken over as a major concern, making it difficult for someone from the 12th century to communicate effectively about their cause.&#10;&#10;2. Maitland relates this analogy to his own desire for solitude because he is feeling overwhelmed and out of place in this future time.

The Afrikanders were a group of people from South Africa who developed advanced technology while the rest of the world lost it during their isolation for several centuries.&#10;2. They had a tradition of white supremacy and were terrified of being encircled, which led them to conquer the world with their armies of invincible killing-machines, resulting in the War of Annihilation where one and a half billion human beings were destroyed.&#10;3. After the war, the Afrikanders founded modern civilization, using robots for food production and manufacturing. This allowed the population to be reduced to three hundred million.&#10;4. However, there are no more Afrikanders today due to intermarriage and racial blending, as a psychology of guilt led them to expiate their huge crime through this means.&#10;5. Despite their historical significance, the Afrikanders no longer exist as a separate race, with only Afrikaans remaining as the world language.">

After the war, the Afrikanders founded modern civilization, using robots for food production and manufacturing. This allowed the population to be reduced to three hundred million.&#10;4. However, there are no more Afrikanders today due to intermarriage and racial blending, as a psychology of guilt led them to expiate their huge crime through this means.&#10;5.

The Ninth Symphony is often associated with themes of joy, triumph, and brotherhood, reflecting Maitland's anticipation and excitement about the prospect of visiting Mars.&#10;&#10;His excitement is further demonstrated through his vivid mental images of exploring space: picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis Major, viewing Venus, Saturn, Earth from the Moon, and circling the Moon. These visions reinforce Maitland's passion for space exploration.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the woman bringing him food and expressing admiration for his ability to get what he wants further fuels his excitement.

An earnest 12th Century crusader, if deposited into 1950 and trying to rekindle the anti-Mohammedan movement, would not have a good chance of success. This is because the context and values of the time have significantly changed. In the 1950s, people were more focused on human development rather than religious or ideological conflicts, especially in comparison to a medieval crusade. Furthermore, nuclear technology had taken over as a major concern, making it difficult for someone from the 12th century to communicate effectively about their cause.&#10;&#10;2. Maitland relates this analogy to his own desire for solitude because he is feeling overwhelmed and out of place in this future time. Just like the 12th-century crusader trying to rekindle an old conflict, Maitland's lifelong dream of visiting Mars seems impossible in this civilization that has no interest in exploring space. He feels isolated in his values and priorities, making him want some time alone to process these feelings.">

The woman suggests that Maitland may be asking the wrong question. Instead of wondering why people in the 20th Century wanted to go to worlds that humans are not suited to inhabit, he should consider why people in this future time find different times and places more fascinating than exploring outer space. This indicates a shift in values and priorities between the two periods, with the current age placing greater emphasis on understanding and developing human potential rather than technological advancements.&#10;2. The reason men no longer seem to have an interest in reaching the planets is that their focus has changed over time. In Maitland's time, there may have been a strong desire for space exploration due to the spirit of adventure and curiosity. However, in this future society, people prefer to explore different times and places through time travel, as they find it more exciting and fulfilling than technological advancements. This shift in priorities has resulted in a lack of interest in visiting the planets, despite having advanced technology that could make it possible.">

    <edge source="1. The woman suggests that Maitland may be asking the wrong question. Instead of wondering why people in the 20th Century wanted to go to worlds that humans are not suited to inhabit, he should consider why people in this future time find different times and places more fascinating than exploring outer space. This indicates a shift in values and priorities between the two periods, with the current age placing greater emphasis on understanding and developing human potential rather than technological advancements.&#10;2. The reason men no longer seem to have an interest in reaching the planets is that their focus has changed over time. In Maitland's time, there may have been a strong desire for space exploration due to the spirit of adventure and curiosity. However, in this future society, people prefer to explore different times and places through time travel, as they find it more exciting and fulfilling than technological advancements. This shift in priorities has resulted in a lack of interest in visiting the planets, despite having advanced technology that could make it possible." target="1. Maitland's lifelong dream and ambition have been to reach Mars and explore outer space, representing the spirit of adventure and curiosity within him. He had hoped that in traveling through time, he would finally have the chance to visit the planet. The idea of exploring new worlds and discovering the unknown is deeply ingrained in him.&#10;2. Despite learning that people in this future time have no interest in visiting the planets, Maitland feels devastated and defeated because he believes that the opportunity to reach Mars has slipped away from him forever. He cannot fathom a civilization capable of discovering time travel but not utilizing it for space exploration.&#10;3. The woman's revelation that no one has ever visited the planets is particularly disappointing for Maitland, as he had envisioned a future where humanity had already established itself in the Solar System. He is eager to learn about and experience this aspect of human progress but finds himself in a time where such advancements have not yet occurred.">

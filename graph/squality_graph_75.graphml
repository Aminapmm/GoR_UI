    <node id="Based on the story, Noork, Rold, and Sarna's next course of action is to &quot;paddle boldly across the water&quot; instead of hiding in the trees until night. They plan to stay close to the shore as they paddle along, so that even if they are detected, they will have already put a safe distance between them and the wall. This plan is decided upon because the Misty Ones, who guard against the escape of slaves, are continually passing from the island to the shore, and by appearing to be Misty Ones themselves, they hope to blend in and avoid detection." />

The tinted shield had revealed that dozens&#10;of the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the&#10;escape of the slaves.&#10; &#10;  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging&#10;as he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping&#10;from below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of&#10;them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the&#10;jungle matted ground outside the wall.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Will we hide here in the trees until night?&quot; asked the girl's full&#10;voice.&#10; &#10;  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. &quot;I think&#10;not,&quot; he said. &quot;The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island&#10;to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we&#10;will paddle boldly across the water.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That is good,&quot; agreed the slave, &quot;unless they see us put out from the&#10;shore.

Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite&#10;the Temple of Uzdon.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,&quot;&#10;said Noork thoughtfully. &quot;In that way even if they detect us we will&#10;have put a safe distance between us.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands&#10;of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the&#10;grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered&#10;and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Once we reach the jungle,&quot; he told the girl, &quot;off come these robes. I&#10;am broiled alive.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.&#10;&quot;Misty Ones!&quot; he hissed to Rold. &quot;They crouch among the reeds.

    <node id=" with a satisfying whisper&#10;of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the&#10;mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Some day,&quot; he said reflectively, &quot;I am going to visit the island of&#10;the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I&#10;have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to&#10;your city of Grath....&quot; He smiled.&#10; &#10;  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer&#10;speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He&#10;turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive&#10;reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of&#10;the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,&#10;numbing it so he felt nothing for some time.&#10; &#10;  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,&#10;Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once&#10;there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down&#10;at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His&#10;chest expanded proudly.&#10; &#10;  &quot;No longer,&quot; he told Gurn, &quot;am I a man without a name. I am Captain&#10;Dietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil&#10;man when my bird died.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. &quot;The&#10;evil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace&#10;with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;It is good, Noork,&quot; smiled Tholon Sarna.&#10;End of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" one.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The old man chuckled dryly. &quot;If your wife be plain,&quot; he said, &quot;neither&#10;master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a&#10;good woman—and ugly, my son.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Some night,&quot; snarled the slave, &quot;I'm going over the wall. Even the&#10;Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Silence,&quot; hissed the white-haired man. &quot;Such talk is madness. We are&#10;safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island&#10;of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,&#10;are not unkind.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,&quot; he finished, &quot;and I will&#10;complete my checking of the gardens.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the&#10;tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,&#10;and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles&#10;that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made&#10;clear-cut" />
    <node id=" They&#10;carry nets and clubs to trap us.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his&#10;heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore&#10;them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one&#10;hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and&#10;bodies of the enemy.&#10; &#10;  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they&#10;were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously&#10;and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice&#10;changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.&#10; &#10;  &quot;So,&quot; he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but&#10;was not, &quot;it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?&quot;&#10;A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a&#10;nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that&#10;of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich&#10;had trailed across space to Sekk!" />
    <node id="The story does not provide specific information on what danger Noork perceived as they arrived at the marshy lowlands of the mainland that made him freeze in his tracks and order the removal of their robes once they reach the jungle. However, it is mentioned that Noork saw &quot;Misty Ones&quot; who were carrying nets and clubs to trap them. It can be inferred that Noork perceived the Misty Ones as a danger, and therefore, decided to paddle boldly across the water instead of hiding in the trees until night. They also planned to stay close to the shore as they paddled along, so that even if they were detected, they would have already put a safe distance between them and the wall. Once they reach the jungle, Noork plans to remove their robes, possibly to move more freely and silently in the trees, and also to be able to defend themselves better." />

He knew that&#10;the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered&#10;brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men&#10;could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.&#10; &#10;  But Noork was wrong.

His skin was not so golden as&#10;that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating&#10;in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face&#10;was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular&#10;design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons&#10;were two long knives and a club.&#10; &#10;  &quot;So,&quot; said Noork, &quot;the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And&#10;the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like&#10;this.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down&#10;the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its&#10;unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the&#10;stains from the dead man's foggy robe.&#10; &#10;  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the&#10;drying fabric of the mantle and donned it.&#10;Ud tasted" />
    <node id="The person who put on the priest's robe and escaped over the wall with Noork was Tholon Sarna. She wore the priest's robe to help them blend in and avoid detection as they made their escape. The cloaks that Noork was wearing, along with the vision shield, were the robes of invisibility and the sacred window of Uzdon that the priests possessed. These cloaks allowed the wearer to become invisible, but they also had a transparent face mask called &quot;Uzdon's window&quot; that allowed them to see. Noork wore the cloak and vision shield to hide his identity and give him an advantage in combat against the priest. He later took off the damaged robe he was wearing and gave Sarna the new one so they could both blend in and escape unnoticed. The cloaks and vision shield played a crucial role in their escape by providing them with the ability to move unseen and defend themselves against any threats they might encounter." />
    <node id=" &#10;  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the&#10;sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork&#10;leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a&#10;moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.&#10; &#10;  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.&#10;Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and&#10;slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?&quot; Noork asked tensely.&#10; &#10;  &quot;No,&quot; came the girl's low voice, &quot;I do not think so. I did not know&#10;that this priest was here until he appeared behind you.&quot; A slow smile&#10;crossed Noork's hidden features. &quot;His robe must be close by,&quot; he told&#10;the girl. &quot;He must have been stationed here because the priests feared&#10;the guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched&#10;the soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway&#10;entrance.

Noork's eyes narrowed as&#10;he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.&#10; &#10;  &quot;So,&quot; he said, &quot;to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do&#10;not trust your guards, then.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The priest laughed. &quot;We also have robes of invisibility,&quot; he said, &quot;and&#10;the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.&quot; He snarled suddenly at the&#10;silent figure of the white man. &quot;Down on your knees, guard, and show me&#10;your face before I kill you!&quot;&#10; &#10;  Noork raised his sword. &quot;Take my hood off if you dare, priest,&quot; he&#10;offered.&#10; &#10;  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of&#10;his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the&#10;velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from&#10;the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that&#10;drew blood from left shoulder to elbow.&#10; &#10;  The fighting grew more furious as the priest" />

He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the&#10;priest &quot;Uzdon's window&quot; over his hood, and then proceeded to don the&#10;new robe.&#10; &#10;  &quot;My own robe is slit in a dozen places,&quot; he explained to the girl's&#10;curious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision&#10;slot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the&#10;girl's hand.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;let us escape over the wall before the alarm is&#10;given.&quot;&#10;Without incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the&#10;rows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,&#10;his crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not&#10;watching when Rold abruptly faded from view.&#10; &#10;  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of&#10;the vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had&#10;no wish to discard them yet.

He&#10;was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white&#10;man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so&#10;his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed&#10;body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the&#10;slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.&#10; &#10;  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,&#10;and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch&#10;so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his&#10;mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful&#10;whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the&#10;main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his&#10;enemy.&#10; &#10;  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the&#10;sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck.

He examined&#10;the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive&#10;timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a&#10;prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It is Noork,&quot; he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go&#10;wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.&#10; &#10;  &quot;The priest,&quot; hissed the girl.&#10; &#10;  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the&#10;spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he&#10;faced the burly priest of the Skull.&#10; &#10;  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield&#10;of transparent tinted material was fastened.

Not until then did he hurry on down the&#10;stone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,&#10;was held prisoner.&#10;The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water&#10;dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two&#10;sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was&#10;walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and&#10;toward this Noork made his way.&#10; &#10;  He stood beside the door. &quot;Sarna,&quot; he called softly, &quot;Tholon Sarna.&quot;&#10; &#10;  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland&#10;by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the&#10;rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple&#10;skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the&#10;mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's&#10;valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and&#10;confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Gurn is a golden-skinned warrior who was exiled from the walled city of Grath, along with his sister Sarna. He is described as tall and strong, and has a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair. He talks with his own shadow when he thinks. Gurn is also an exile from the city of Grath, where the rulers call him a traitor. The reason for his exile is that he no longer wanted to make slaves of the captured Zurans from other valleys. He and his group of Vasads, which include hairy beast men, trap and skin the Misty Ones as a way to protect themselves from what they perceive as demons. Gurn is also friends with Noork, who he refers to as &quot;my friend&quot; multiple times in the story." />
    <node id=" friend.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. &quot;Gurn!&quot; she cried. &quot;Is he tall&#10;and strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with&#10;human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That is Gurn,&quot; admitted Noork shortly. &quot;He is also an exile from the&#10;walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told&#10;me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Indeed I do,&quot; cried Sarna. &quot;My brother said that we should no longer&#10;make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Noork smiled. &quot;I am glad he is your brother,&quot; he said simply.&#10;The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded&#10;into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Brown-skinned one!&quot; she cried with a stamp of her shapely little&#10;sandalled foot. &quot;I am displeased with the noises of your tongue.

But Noork knew nothing of that chase.&#10;The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he&#10;remembered.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I see you have come from the island,&quot; said the Doctor. &quot;Perhaps you&#10;can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the&#10;secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and&#10;make the Fatherland invincible.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I do not understand too well,&quot; said Noork hesitantly. &quot;Are we enemies?&#10;There is so much I have forgotten.&quot; He regarded the brutal face&#10;thoughtfully.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise&#10;that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's&#10;defenseless ribs.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,&quot; he roared suddenly,&#10;" />
    <node id="Noork threw himself into the jungle and climbed up a tree after realizing that the girl had vanished and an unseen enemy was approaching him because he wanted to seek shelter and avoid the attack from his unseen foe. Since his arm was numbed from being hit by the club of his unseen assailant, Noork decided to climb up the tree where he could find safety and have a better view of the situation below. From there, he was able to observe the &quot;Misty Ones&quot; who were moving on the trail, confirming his suspicion that they were not entirely invisible." />
    <node id=". Once&#10;there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down&#10;at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.&#10;Noork&#10;At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no&#10;stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse&#10;of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all&#10;too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the&#10;Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied&#10;with the mud of the trail.&#10; &#10;  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain&#10;was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He&#10;climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe&#10;fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of&#10;the great limb and filled his arms with fruit.&#10; &#10;  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread&#10;and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork&#10;found that he was pelting a" />

The amnesia is often but a&#10;pretense.&quot;&#10; &#10;  His lip curled. &quot;This is something for you to remember, Captain&#10;Dietrich,&quot; he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on&#10;Noork's bronzed chest.&#10; &#10;  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless&#10;fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide&#10;belly. He stumbled backward.&#10; &#10;  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and&#10;his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.&#10;In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt&#10;invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.&#10; &#10;  As he rose to his feet the robed figure" />

The upper levels, then, were forbidden to&#10;the slaves and common citizens of the island.&#10; &#10;  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his&#10;sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it&#10;there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight&#10;of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two&#10;short swords rose to bar his way.&#10; &#10;  &quot;None are to pass save the priests,&quot; spoke a voice from nowhere&#10;gruffly. &quot;The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the&#10;most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the&#10;sacrifice is chosen.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew&#10;his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.&#10; &#10;  In that instant Noork attacked.

The limp body beneath him struggled no more.&#10;He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a&#10;half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.&#10; &#10;  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging&#10;out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle&#10;on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion&#10;of the upper temple was muted to a murmur.&#10; &#10;  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that&#10;had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to&#10;battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.&#10; &#10;  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes.

Among them moved the&#10;squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs&#10;fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing&#10;golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the&#10;brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast&#10;men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.&#10; &#10;  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were&#10;stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the&#10;Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed.

    <node id="As Noork approaches and enters the Skull temple, he sees a variety of individuals engaged in different activities. The stairs leading up to the temple are bustling with red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers, who are either climbing or descending. There are also Vasads, which are described as squatty gnarled shapes with shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains. Cringing golden-skinned slaves are also present, moving furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones.&#10;&#10;The odors present in this scene include the stale sweaty smell of the slaves and Vasads, as well as the musky stench of the incense from the temple. These odors contribute to the overall atmosphere of the temple, which is likely intended to evoke a sense of mystery, otherworldliness, and perhaps even unease.&#10;&#10;As Noork moves through this scene, he encounters two guards at the entrance of the temple, who rise to bar his way with short swords. Noork responds by striking them twice with a club, rendering them unconscious and preventing them from raising an alarm for several hours. He then disguises himself in one of the guard's hooded cloaks and hides their bodies in the chamber of the sleeping guards to avoid detection as he heads down to the prison pit where Tholon Sarna is being held.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene that Noork encounters as he approaches and enters the Skull temple is one of chaos and activity, with a range of different individuals engaged in various tasks and a distinct set of odors present. This sets the stage for Noork's daring rescue mission and helps to build tension and anticipation as the story unfolds." />
    <node id="The encounter between Noork and the burly priest is marked by suspicion and aggression from the beginning. The priest reveals that the priests of Uzdon can see through Noork's invisibility cloak, implying they don't trust their guards. He also mentions having &quot;robes of invisibility&quot; and &quot;the sacred window of Uzdon,&quot; which suggests the priests have advanced technology or magical abilities.&#10;&#10;Noork, feeling threatened, challenges the priest to reveal himself, leading to a sword fight. The priest's shield is made of transparent tinted material, possibly another example of their advanced technology or magic. During the fight, Noork damages the priest's shield and receives a cut on his shoulder. The fighting becomes more intense, indicating the high stakes and animosity between them.&#10;&#10;The priest's aggressive behavior can be seen in his demand for Noork to reveal himself, as well as his bellow of rage and lunge forward with his sword. Noork, too, shows aggression by throwing himself into the fight and attacking the guards when they block his way. The overall atmosphere is one of tension, mistrust, and hostility." />
    <node id="Based on the text, when Noork encounters a hairy, scarred man (referred to as &quot;The Misty One&quot;) on a game trail near the Temple of Uzdon in Zuran, he concludes that the men of the island and the guards of the temple are not trustworthy. This impression is reinforced when he sees the Misty One almost like himself but with bestial features, low retreating forehead, more body hair, hideous swollen colored scars, and carrying primitive weapons.&#10;&#10;Noork's observations of this individual make him suspicious of the islanders and temple guards. He concludes that they prey upon their own kind and views the Temple of Uzdon as being guarded by cowardly warriors. This encounter strengthens Noork's initial belief, making him more cautious and mistrustful of those around him.&#10;&#10;In summary, after meeting the hairy, scarred man on the game trail, Noork forms a negative opinion about the men of the island and the guards of the Temple of Uzdon. He perceives them as untrustworthy, bestial, and potentially dangerous, which influences his actions and decisions throughout the story." />

Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the&#10;same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and&#10;perhaps then he could remember better who he had been.&#10; &#10;  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was&#10;gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last&#10;of the Axis criminals at large.

Noork then hid the bodies of the two guards under their robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards, put on one of their hooded cloaks as a disguise, and dragged their bodies out of the stairway before hurrying down the steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna was being held." />

The unseen man's cry of warning&#10;gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon&#10;it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.&#10; &#10;  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the&#10;shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.&#10;For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction&#10;of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then&#10;they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to&#10;blood-slippery step.&#10; &#10;  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the&#10;same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man&#10;with a pistol-like report" />

    <node id="The person referred to in the story is Noork. While being pursued, Noork takes several actions to ensure his escape and the safety of Tholon Sarna, the girl he is rescuing. Here are the key steps he takes:&#10;&#10;1. He renders two guards unconscious to prevent them from raising an alarm.&#10;2. He disguises himself in one of the guards' hooded cloaks to blend in and avoid detection as he heads down to the prison pit where Tholon Sarna is being held.&#10;3. He hides the bodies of the guards to prevent anyone from discovering that they have been attacked, which would inevitably lead to an alarm being raised.&#10;4. He puts on the priest's discarded robe and the transparent &quot;Uzdon's window&quot; mask to avoid detection while moving through the pits.&#10;5. He escapes with Tholon Sarna over the wall and across a field, still wearing the guard's cloak and the priest's robe to remain inconspicuous.&#10;6. He keeps the cloaks and vision shield as they cross the field, revealing that dozens of the Misty Ones are stationed around the wall to guard against the escape of slaves.&#10;7. He climbs over the wall with Tholon Sarna and uses a rope to descend to the jungle matted ground outside the wall.&#10;&#10;Noork brings the girl (Tholon Sarna) and the cloaks with him for several reasons:&#10;&#10;1. To ensure her safety, as she is being held captive and needs his help to escape.&#10;2. To use the cloaks and vision shield to their advantage, providing them with the ability to move unseen and defend themselves against any threats they might encounter.&#10;3. To maintain his disguise and blend in as he moves through the pits, avoiding detection by those who may be pursuing him.&#10;4. To keep the guard's cloak on while crossing the field and climbing over the wall, helping him remain inconspicuous and less suspicious to anyone watching from a distance." />

These slaves are considered to be the most beautiful and are chosen daily for sacrifice to Uzdon. The sacrifice takes place when the sun is directly overhead, with the chosen slave's heart being torn out while she is still alive.&#10;3. Tholon Sarna, a young woman and daughter of Tholon Dist, a merchant, is also held captive in this pit among the other slaves. She is distinguished from them by not wearing the simple skirt and brief jacket of the golden people from Zura's valleys but instead wears a simple band of cloth around her hips and confines her breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope skin.&#10;4. The priests select one young female slave each day for sacrifice, and if Tholon Sarna is chosen, her blood will be shed like any other's, staining the altar regardless of her father's status or lineage.&#10;5.

He renders two guards unconscious to prevent them from raising an alarm.&#10;2. He disguises himself in one of the guards' hooded cloaks to blend in and avoid detection as he heads down to the prison pit where Tholon Sarna is being held.&#10;3. He hides the bodies of the guards to prevent anyone from discovering that they have been attacked, which would inevitably lead to an alarm being raised.&#10;4.

He escapes with Tholon Sarna over the wall and across a field, still wearing the guard's cloak and the priest's robe to remain inconspicuous.&#10;6. He keeps the cloaks and vision shield as they cross the field, revealing that dozens of the Misty Ones are stationed around the wall to guard against the escape of slaves.&#10;7. He climbs over the wall with Tholon Sarna and uses a rope to descend to the jungle matted ground outside the wall.&#10;&#10;Noork brings the girl (Tholon Sarna) and the cloaks with him for several reasons:&#10;&#10;1.

To use the cloaks and vision shield to their advantage, providing them with the ability to move unseen and defend themselves against any threats they might encounter.&#10;3. To maintain his disguise and blend in as he moves through the pits, avoiding detection by those who may be pursuing him.&#10;4. To keep the guard's cloak on while crossing the field and climbing over the wall, helping him remain inconspicuous and less suspicious to anyone watching from a distance.">

He also took a club from the floor beside one of the unconscious guards and used it to strike the other guard until he stopped making the gurgling sounds and started breathing regularly. Noork then hid the bodies of the two guards under their robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards, put on one of their hooded cloaks as a disguise, and dragged their bodies out of the stairway before hurrying down the steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna was being held.">

The stairs leading up to the temple are bustling with red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers, who are either climbing or descending.

Cringing golden-skinned slaves are also present, moving furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones.&#10;&#10;The odors present in this scene include the stale sweaty smell of the slaves and Vasads, as well as the musky stench of the incense from the temple.

Noork responds by striking them twice with a club, rendering them unconscious and preventing them from raising an alarm for several hours. He then disguises himself in one of the guard's hooded cloaks and hides their bodies in the chamber of the sleeping guards to avoid detection as he heads down to the prison pit where Tholon Sarna is being held.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene that Noork encounters as he approaches and enters the Skull temple is one of chaos and activity, with a range of different individuals engaged in various tasks and a distinct set of odors present. This sets the stage for Noork's daring rescue mission and helps to build tension and anticipation as the story unfolds.">

He is throwing overripe fruit at blurry, shadowy shapes that he can see moving along the sunken trail beneath him in order to reveal the presence of the Misty Ones more clearly. The sticky fruit stains their bodies, making them more visible as they move along the trail, allowing Noork to gather information about their patrol patterns from a safer distance and avoid being caught by these unseen enemies.">

Noork rushed into the stone-walled room prepared to battle the Misty Ones after hearing gurgling sounds from one of the warriors inside because he thought that they might have been injured or incapacitated but still alive and able to give an alarm or call for help.&#10;2. In his haste, Noork had previously killed two guards at the entrance to the temple's upper levels, ran quickly down the steps, and entered the nearby doorway where the stone-walled room was located. He also took a club from the floor beside one of the unconscious guards and used it to strike the other guard until he stopped making the gurgling sounds and started breathing regularly. Noork then hid the bodies of the two guards under their robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards, put on one of their hooded cloaks as a disguise, and dragged their bodies out of the stairway before hurrying down the steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna was being held." target=" of rock, bit through the hidden neck and&#10;shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward&#10;impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his&#10;left.&#10; &#10;  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony&#10;structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his&#10;hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning&#10;gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon&#10;it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.&#10; &#10;  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the&#10;shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.&#10;For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction&#10;of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then&#10;they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to&#10;blood-slippery step.&#10; &#10;  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the&#10;same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man&#10;with a pistol-like report">

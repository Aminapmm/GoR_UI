    <node id="The speaker, Carol, feels that there is a lack of understanding and appreciation for her ambitions and desires in her relationship with the listener, which is implied to be her husband, Dr. Kennicott. She believes he perceives her as being &quot;perfectly satisfied&quot; because she has been talking about getting the most out of life, but he only thinks of her as being useful and content. This is due to Carol's tendency to engage with people who are more cultured or intellectual, and her disinterest in those who do not meet her expectations, such as Jack Elder. Additionally, Carol has dreams of financial independence and traveling, which she feels her husband does not understand or share." />

    <node id="The nightly routine of the characters in the text includes Kennicott being called away to attend to a patient in the middle of the night. This involves him getting out of bed, dressing, and traveling to the patient's location. Meanwhile, his wife, Carol, remains in bed and listens to his interactions with the patients through the floor. She is irritated by having to move an old plush chair every time she opens the closet door to undress. When Kennicott returns from attending to the patient, he writes down his destination on a slip of paper and goes to bed, leaving Carol to marvel at his skill and endurance as a doctor. The next morning, Kennicott wakes up early for work while Carol is still in bed.&#10;&#10;Sources of irritation or inconvenience for the narrator include having to share a small space with her husband, having to move the plush chair every time she opens the closet door, and being woken up in the middle of the night by her husband's calls. Additionally, Carol is often portrayed as feeling inferior to her husband, who is depicted as a skilled and hardworking doctor, while she struggles to find her place in the world and define her own aspirations." />

    <node id="In this scene from the text, Carol Kennicott is waiting for her husband, Dr. Kennicott, at his office. The office consists of two rooms - a waiting room and a consultation room - both of which have bare wooden floors and scaly brown furniture. The waiting room contains several patients, including two women and a man in a railroad brakeman's uniform. The atmosphere is tense, and Carol feels out of place among the other patients. She reflects on her husband's work as a doctor and his interactions with his patients, feeling both admiration and frustration at the same time. Overall, this scene highlights the challenges and complexities of being married to someone who works in a demanding profession like medicine." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is implied that Carol (Nora) feels superior to others due to her childhood experiences. Although the text specifically mentions her father's attitude and the location of her home in the Minnesota Valley as contributing factors, there are no explicit details about how these factors influenced her tendency to feel superior.&#10;&#10;From the narrative, we can infer that Carol's father was a tender man but also felt superior to ordinary people, which may have influenced Carol's own sense of superiority. Additionally, the text suggests that Carol spent a lot of time sitting on the cliffs above Mankato, looking down at the valley and wanting to shake up cups of coffee and cold lamb for the Nelsons. This sense of detachment and observation from a higher perspective may have contributed to her feeling superior towards others.&#10;&#10;However, without further information or context about Carol's childhood experiences, it is challenging to provide a more detailed answer. The factors mentioned in the narrative are suggestive but not definitive in explaining Carol's tendency to feel superior towards others." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the woman (Carol) chooses to dine alone in the dining room instead of joining Bjornstam and Bea in the kitchen because she wants to assert her independence and see herself as equal to them. Despite seeing them as friends and enjoying their company when she later joins them in the kitchen, dining alone is a symbolic act for her to reject traditional social distinctions and taboos that make her feel like a &quot;lady&quot; who cannot dine with her guests. By doing so, she creates a boundary between herself and her guests while also expressing her desire for self-reliance and self-expression.

    <node id="Carol decides to leave her husband, Kennicott, due to her frustration and contempt for him, which is triggered when he mentions building a new house. She interprets his attitude as dismissive of her own ambitions and desires, and feels that he thinks she is perfectly satisfied with their current life. Furthermore, she feels contempt for his colloquialism and superior to him, leading her to reject the chocolate he casually mentions and throw it away in the wastebasket.&#10;&#10;Carol's fear of the emotional labor involved in asserting independence affects this decision by making her hesitant to confront Kennicott about their issues. She has been feeling unappreciated and misunderstood in their relationship, but has not spoken up about it due to her belief that it would be emotionally taxing and difficult. However, when Kennicott mentions building a new house, it becomes a breaking point for Carol, who feels that she can no longer continue to be in a relationship where he does not appreciate or understand her ambitions and desires.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Carol's frustration and contempt towards Kennicott, combined with her fear of the emotional labor involved in asserting independence, ultimately prompts her decision to leave him." />

    <node id="The &quot;gray darkness&quot; affecting the lives of ten million women, as described by Carol, refers to a general sense of discontent and dissatisfaction among women from different backgrounds and circumstances. These women are seeking a more conscious and fulfilling life, rather than merely existing in a state of drudgery, sleep, and eventual death. They are tired of always deferring hope for a better future to the next generation and want to experience &quot;everything&quot; here and now.&#10;&#10;Carol identifies this desire as a common revolt across all classes and groups that have historically been marginalized and oppressed. She sees it as a collective yearning for a Utopia where everyone has equal access to resources, opportunities, and individualism. This desire is not limited to material possessions but extends to a more profound sense of self-actualization and personal growth.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the women want more than just good taste or fastidiousness; they seek a life that allows them to explore their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, several aspects of motoring brought great enthusiasm to Dr. Kennicott. He had a two-year-old Buick that he nursed and cared for meticulously, even in winter when it was stored in the garage. He filled the grease-cups, varnished a fender, removed debris from beneath the back seat, and became excited about potential motor trips for the next summer. He also spent time wandering out to the garage during winter afternoons to stare at the car, further indicating his fondness for it.&#10;&#10;Dr. Kennicott's enthusiasm for motoring was so great that it was akin to a religious faith for him, with electric sparks serving as candles and piston-rings possessing the sanctity of altar-vessels. He also enjoyed planning motor routes on railway maps, tracing trips from Gopher Prairie to Winnipeg or Des Moines or Grand Marais. He often spoke about these details to Sam Clark, indicating that he looked forward to sharing his passion for motoring with others.&#10;&#10;Overall, Dr. Kennicott's enthusiasm for motoring was a significant source of enjoyment for him, as evidenced by his meticulous care of his car and detailed planning for future motor trips." />

In this situation, there was a lamp burning close to where Dave had sent the ether, creating a risk of explosion. Ether was used as an anesthetic, and chloroform was likely preferred in this case because it is not as flammable as ether. The fact that both Kennicott and Carol knew about the risk of explosion while operating on Adolph Morgenroth indicates that they were aware of the potential danger but had to proceed with the surgery due to the severity of the injury." />

    <node id="The travelers, Carol and Dr. Kennicott, have mixed thoughts on the approaching blizzard. Initially, Carol reminisces about how they used to find blizzards exciting and fun when she was a girl.

He knows that getting lost or freezing to death are real dangers during a blizzard on the prairie.&#10;&#10;As the blizzard approaches, the weather conditions deteriorate rapidly, with larger and harder snowflakes reducing visibility. Despite this, Carol feels confident in her husband's abilities and remains calm, wrapping herself in a woolen robe for warmth.

The reason why the speaker believes they could have charged more for the procedure is not directly mentioned in the narrative. However, Carol mentions that Dr. Westlake and another doctor &quot;let on&quot; that if they had waited two hours more, the patient would have developed peritonitis, suggesting a sense of urgency and potentially increasing the perceived value of their services. Additionally, there is a mention that Dr. Westlake and McGanum diagnose the patient with &quot;terrible adhesions,&quot; which may also contribute to the perception that their services are worth more.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that this answer is based on the provided narrative and does not reflect any real-life medical expertise or knowledge about the skill level of specific doctors named in the narrative." />

The red irritable motor kept up a red&#10;irritable &quot;tip-tip-tip-tip-tip-tip.&quot; The whine of the saw rose till it&#10;simulated the shriek of a fire-alarm whistle at night, but always at the&#10;end it gave a lively metallic clang, and in the stillness she heard the&#10;flump of the cut stick falling on the pile.&#10;&#10;She threw a motor robe over her, ran out.

He picked up a handful of pop-corn, let it run&#10;through his fingers, looked at her wistfully.&#10;&#10;With the loneliness of one who has put away a possible love Carol saw&#10;that he was a stranger. She saw that he had never been anything but&#10;a frame on which she had hung shining garments. If she had let him&#10;diffidently make love to her, it was not because she cared, but because&#10;she did not care, because it did not matter.&#10;&#10;She smiled at him with the exasperating tactfulness of a woman checking&#10;a flirtation; a smile like an airy pat on the arm. She sighed, &quot;You're&#10;a dear to let me tell you my imaginary troubles.&quot; She bounced up, and&#10;trilled, &quot;Shall we take the pop-corn in to them now?&quot;&#10;&#10;Guy looked after her desolately.&#10;&#10;While she teased Vida and Kennicott she was repeating, &quot;I must go on.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;VI&#10;&#10;&#10;Miles Bjornstam, the pariah &quot;Red Swede,&quot; had brought his circular saw&#10;" />

In her one glance she&#10;had seen that his blue flannel shirt was open at a corded tobacco-brown&#10;neck, the hollows of which were sprinkled with thin black and gray&#10;hairs. He was covered with a sheet, like a corpse, and outside the sheet&#10;was his right arm, wrapped in towels stained with blood.&#10;&#10;But Kennicott strode into the other room gaily, and she followed him.&#10;With surprising delicacy in his large fingers he unwrapped the towels&#10;and revealed an arm which, below the elbow, was a mass of blood and raw&#10;flesh. The man bellowed. The room grew thick about her; she was very&#10;seasick; she fled to a chair in the kitchen. Through the haze of nausea&#10;she heard Kennicott grumbling, &quot;Afraid it will have to come off, Adolph.&#10;What did you do? Fall on a reaper blade? We'll fix it right up. Carrie!&#10;CAROL!&quot;&#10;&#10;She couldn't--she couldn" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the woman, Carol, feels a mix of emotions as she witnesses her husband, Dr. Kennicott, perform a surgical operation on an injured man named Adolph. Initially, she is fearful and concerned for Adolph's well-being, but she also feels pride in her husband's competence and confidence in performing the operation without hospital facilities.&#10;&#10;Carol is particularly surprised by her husband's comment that the medical procedure is &quot;simple,&quot; as she reflects on the complexity of his work as a doctor. She admires his ability to stay calm and focused under pressure, and she feels a sense of respect for his expertise in the field. At the same time, she also experiences frustration and contempt for her husband's colloquialism, which she interprets as a dismissive attitude towards her own ambitions and desires.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's observations and thoughts highlight the challenges and complexities of being married to someone who works in a demanding profession like medicine. While she admires her husband's skill and competence, she also struggles with feelings of inferiority and frustration at his perceived lack of understanding or support for her own aspirations. The scene also underscores the emotional complexity of witnessing a medical procedure, as Carol experiences a range of emotions from fear and concern to pride and surprise at her husband's abilities." />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that Carol (Nora) is evaluating herself in comparison to Mrs. Dillon based on their social status and physical appearance. She is worried about being seen as part of a &quot;herd of yearners,&quot; which suggests a concern for appearing unsophisticated or common, similar to how she perceives Mrs. Dillon. Additionally, Carol mentions having &quot;fat ankles,&quot; indicating that she is also concerned about her physical appearance and how it may be judged by others.&#10;&#10;Carol's preoccupation with social status and appearances can be traced back to her upbringing, where she was influenced by her father's superior attitude towards ordinary people and spent a lot of time observing the world from a higher perspective. This has led her to have high standards for herself and others around her, causing her to feel frustrated with her husband and disconnected from the townspeople in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;In this particular scene, Carol's concern about being perceived as part of a &quot;herd of yearners&quot; may reflect her desire to distinguish herself from Mrs. Dillon and other women who aspire for upward social mobility but lack the cultural refinement that Carol values. The fact that she is also concerned about having &quot;fat ankles&quot; suggests that she is self-conscious about her physical appearance and how it may affect others' perceptions of her.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's evaluation of herself in comparison to Mrs. Dillon is influenced by her concerns about social status, appearances, and personal aspirations. These concerns are rooted in her upbringing and have shaped her worldview and values, causing her to feel both admiration and frustration towards her husband's work as a doctor and his interactions with patients." />
    <node id="In the scene described, Dr. Kennicott is treating a severe leg injury that his patient, a farmer named Adolph, sustained from an ax accident. The treatment is taking place in Dr. Kennicott's home, and his wife, Carol, appears excited to assist him during the procedure. Adolph's wife sits on the couch, looking expressionless throughout the process.&#10;&#10;Dr. Kennicott removes Adolph's socks and bandages to examine the wound, which is a &quot;puckered line of crimson&quot; on his white, scarred leg. Despite the gruesome nature of the injury, Carol remains calm and helps her husband prepare for the surgery by moving Adolph to the kitchen table, placing a steel and cotton frame on his face, and administering ether during the procedure.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene highlights the challenging and demanding nature of Dr. Kennicott's work as a doctor, as well as the emotional complexity of witnessing medical procedures. While Carol is initially fearful and nauseous at the sight of Adolph's injury, she soon recovers and takes on an active role in assisting her husband, demonstrating both admiration for his skills and frustration with his dismissive attitude towards her own ambitions." />
    <node id="ellow cut his leg with an ax--pretty bad gash--Halvor Nelson, nine&#10;miles out,&quot; Kennicott observed.&#10;&#10;Carol fluttered at the back of the room, childishly excited when she was&#10;sent to fetch towels and a basin of water. Kennicott lifted the farmer&#10;into a chair and chuckled, &quot;There we are, Halvor! We'll have you out&#10;fixing fences and drinking aquavit in a month.&quot; The farmwife sat on&#10;the couch, expressionless, bulky in a man's dogskin coat and unplumbed&#10;layers of jackets. The flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over&#10;her head now hung about her seamed neck. Her white wool gloves lay in&#10;her lap.&#10;&#10;Kennicott drew from the injured leg the thick red &quot;German sock,&quot; the&#10;innumerous other socks of gray and white wool, then the spiral bandage.&#10;The leg was of an unwholesome dead white, with the black hairs feeble&#10;and thin and flattened, and the scar a puckered line of crimson. Surely,&#10;Carol shuddered, this was not human flesh, the rosy shining tissue of&#10;the amorous" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Carol Kennicott and her husband Dr. Luke Kennicott are attempting to travel home during a severe blizzard. The weather conditions deteriorate rapidly, with larger and harder snowflakes reducing visibility, making it difficult for them to see beyond a hundred feet ahead. The cold and harsh snowy conditions cause their horses and the buffalo robe to become covered in snow, and the air becomes colder with harder snowflakes clawing at their faces. Dr. Kennicott has to navigate through the blizzard skillfully, and despite almost getting stuck in a ditch, he manages to pull the carriage out and continue on their way. The obstacles they encounter along the way include the deteriorating weather conditions, low visibility, and the risk of freezing to death or getting lost during the blizzard." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Carol Kennicott takes several measures to add surprises and variety to her husband's life, even in his shabby medical office. Firstly, she knits an astounding purple scarf and hides it under his supper plate as a surprise gift. Unfortunately, when he discovers it, he looks embarrassed and gasps if it is an anniversary or something, indicating that he may not have appreciated the gesture as much as she had hoped.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol visits her husband's office at three in the afternoon with a thermos of hot coffee and cookies baked by Bea, hoping to surprise him during his work hours. However, when she hides her bundles in the hall and peeks into the waiting room, she finds that it is shabby and outdated, with straight chairs, a shaky pine table, and coverless magazines. The atmosphere is tense, and Carol feels out of place among the other patients.&#10;&#10;These efforts to add surprises and variety to her husband's life show that Carol cares for him deeply and wants to make his life more enjoyable. However, her gestures may not always be appreciated or understood by her husband, who seems more focused on his work as a doctor than on the surprises she tries to create for him." />
    <node id="Dr. Kennicott is confidently preparing to perform a surgical operation on Adolph despite the lack of hospital facilities because he has experience and competence in his field. He is skilled enough to conduct the operation in his own home without any worry. In this scene, Carol is asked to play an active role in the procedure by assisting her husband. She helps move Adolph to the kitchen table, places a steel and cotton frame on his face, and administers ether during the surgery. This demonstrates Carol's admiration for her husband's abilities and her willingness to support him in his work." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Carol's financial and lifestyle goals include achieving financial independence and traveling. She is concerned about ensuring financial security for herself, and it seems like she also wants her husband, Dr. Kennicott, to understand and share her ambitions. However, she feels that he does not appreciate or support her dreams, which leads to frustration and a desire for autonomy. There is no explicit mention of her concerns about his financial security in the narrative." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is not explicitly stated what Carol's (the wife's) opinion is on Dr. Kennicott's view about the waning importance of &quot;romance&quot; in married life. However, it can be inferred that she may disagree with him, as she expresses frustration and contempt for him, implying that there may be a lack of emotional connection or romance in their relationship. She also mentions her desire for financial independence and travel, which could suggest a longing for excitement and adventure, further indicating a potential dissatisfaction with the current state of their marriage. Additionally, Carol's actions in assisting with her husband's surgical procedure demonstrate a level of admiration and support for him, suggesting that she values his work and competence but may still feel unfulfilled or unappreciated in other aspects of their relationship." />

She interprets his attitude as dismissive of her own ambitions and desires, and feels that he thinks she is perfectly satisfied with their current life. Furthermore, she feels contempt for his colloquialism and superior to him, leading her to reject the chocolate he casually mentions and throw it away in the wastebasket.&#10;&#10;Carol's fear of the emotional labor involved in asserting independence affects this decision by making her hesitant to confront Kennicott about their issues. She has been feeling unappreciated and misunderstood in their relationship, but has not spoken up about it due to her belief that it would be emotionally taxing and difficult. However, when Kennicott mentions building a new house, it becomes a breaking point for Carol, who feels that she can no longer continue to be in a relationship where he does not appreciate or understand her ambitions and desires.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Carol's frustration and contempt towards Kennicott, combined with her fear of the emotional labor involved in asserting independence, ultimately prompts her decision to leave him.">

These women are seeking a more conscious and fulfilling life, rather than merely existing in a state of drudgery, sleep, and eventual death. They are tired of always deferring hope for a better future to the next generation and want to experience &quot;everything&quot; here and now.&#10;&#10;Carol identifies this desire as a common revolt across all classes and groups that have historically been marginalized and oppressed. She sees it as a collective yearning for a Utopia where everyone has equal access to resources, opportunities, and individualism. This desire is not limited to material possessions but extends to a more profound sense of self-actualization and personal growth.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the women want more than just good taste or fastidiousness; they seek a life that allows them to explore their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society.">

She is worried about being seen as part of a &quot;herd of yearners,&quot; which suggests a concern for appearing unsophisticated or common, similar to how she perceives Mrs. Dillon. Additionally, Carol mentions having &quot;fat ankles,&quot; indicating that she is also concerned about her physical appearance and how it may be judged by others.&#10;&#10;Carol's preoccupation with social status and appearances can be traced back to her upbringing, where she was influenced by her father's superior attitude towards ordinary people and spent a lot of time observing the world from a higher perspective. This has led her to have high standards for herself and others around her, causing her to feel frustrated with her husband and disconnected from the townspeople in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;In this particular scene, Carol's concern about being perceived as part of a &quot;herd of yearners&quot; may reflect her desire to distinguish herself from Mrs. Dillon and other women who aspire for upward social mobility but lack the cultural refinement that Carol values. The fact that she is also concerned about having &quot;fat ankles&quot; suggests that she is self-conscious about her physical appearance and how it may affect others' perceptions of her.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's evaluation of herself in comparison to Mrs. Dillon is influenced by her concerns about social status, appearances, and personal aspirations. These concerns are rooted in her upbringing and have shaped her worldview and values, causing her to feel both admiration and frustration towards her husband's work as a doctor and his interactions with patients.">

They are tired of always deferring hope for a better future to the next generation and want to experience &quot;everything&quot; here and now.&#10;&#10;Carol identifies this desire as a common revolt across all classes and groups that have historically been marginalized and oppressed. She sees it as a collective yearning for a Utopia where everyone has equal access to resources, opportunities, and individualism. This desire is not limited to material possessions but extends to a more profound sense of self-actualization and personal growth.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the women want more than just good taste or fastidiousness; they seek a life that allows them to explore their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society.">

Additionally, the text suggests that Carol spent a lot of time sitting on the cliffs above Mankato, looking down at the valley and wanting to shake up cups of coffee and cold lamb for the Nelsons. This sense of detachment and observation from a higher perspective may have contributed to her feeling superior towards others.&#10;&#10;However, without further information or context about Carol's childhood experiences, it is challenging to provide a more detailed answer.

Additionally, Carol mentions having &quot;fat ankles,&quot; indicating that she is also concerned about her physical appearance and how it may be judged by others.&#10;&#10;Carol's preoccupation with social status and appearances can be traced back to her upbringing, where she was influenced by her father's superior attitude towards ordinary people and spent a lot of time observing the world from a higher perspective.

Additionally, Carol mentions having &quot;fat ankles,&quot; indicating that she is also concerned about her physical appearance and how it may be judged by others.&#10;&#10;Carol's preoccupation with social status and appearances can be traced back to her upbringing, where she was influenced by her father's superior attitude towards ordinary people and spent a lot of time observing the world from a higher perspective.

She is worried about being seen as part of a &quot;herd of yearners,&quot; which suggests a concern for appearing unsophisticated or common, similar to how she perceives Mrs. Dillon. Additionally, Carol mentions having &quot;fat ankles,&quot; indicating that she is also concerned about her physical appearance and how it may be judged by others.&#10;&#10;Carol's preoccupation with social status and appearances can be traced back to her upbringing, where she was influenced by her father's superior attitude towards ordinary people and spent a lot of time observing the world from a higher perspective.

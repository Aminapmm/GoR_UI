    <node id="1. The group of people discussed in this text consists of Grampa, Joyce, Fred, Junior, Reba, and a young boy referred to as Four. There is also a robot named Fweep.&#10;2. They have landed their vehicle, described as &quot;this world&quot; or &quot;flivver,&quot; on an alien planet. The planet has a smaller diameter than Mercury but a gravitational pull as strong as Earth's, which took them by surprise.&#10;3. Grampa is preoccupied with a puzzle circuit game that involves pushing buttons to turn off lights. He becomes frustrated when he pushes the wrong button during landing, causing the puzzle circuit to beat him.&#10;4. Four, the youngest adult, has some understanding of the alien computer on board their vehicle. He tries to communicate with it and learns that the computer doesn't want its friend (Fweep) to leave. Fweep is a small robot that Four plays with in the meadow.&#10;5. Junior is frustrated with an uncooperative computer that won't perform simple arithmetic or help them understand the planet's heavy metals composition. They suspect there might be uranium present, which was their initial interest in exploring this planet.&#10;6. Reba, Fred's wife and Junior's mother, shows concern for her son and tries to mediate disputes between family members. She is also aware of Four's interaction with Fweep.&#10;7. Fred, the father and leader of the group, is focused on their mission and grows impatient with Grampa's preoccupation with his puzzle circuit game. He wants to get back to work.&#10;8. Joyce, Grampa's daughter and Junior's wife, defends her husband and seems to be the one who takes charge when it comes to dealing with issues related to the alien technology, such as attempting to communicate with the puzzle circuit." />
    <node id=" &quot;Well, now,&quot; Grampa protested, &quot;I got a little put away yet. You'll be sorry when I'm dead and gone.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're never going to die, Grampa,&quot; Joyce said harshly. &quot;Just before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, now,&quot; said Grampa, blinking, &quot;how'd you find out about that? Well, now!&quot; In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. &quot;I'll get you this time!&quot;&#10; &#10; Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the computer where Grampa's chair stood. &quot;You brought that pircuit from Earth, didn't you? What's the game?&quot;&#10; &#10; Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense concentration. &quot;I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit, taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's simple,&quot; Four said without hesitation. &quot;" />
    <node id=" uranium—'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's enough, Four,&quot; Junior interrupted. &quot;Never mind what I said.&quot;&#10; &#10; Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.&#10; &#10; &quot;And, Four,&quot; Reba said automatically, &quot;don't call your father 'Junior.' It sounds disrespectful.&quot;&#10; &#10; Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever noticed about the boy.&#10; &#10; &quot;But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'&quot; Four complained. &quot;Besides, Fred is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's different,&quot; Reba said.&#10; &#10; Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. &quot;See!&quot; The pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. &quot;That landing made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat" />
    <node id=" all,&quot; he added wistfully, &quot;he's never had any friends.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How do you know all these things?&quot; Joyce asked from her doorway, excitement in her voice. &quot;Can you talk to it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Behind her, Fred said, &quot;Now, Joyce, you promised—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But this is important,&quot; Joyce cut him off eagerly. &quot;Can you? Talk to it, I mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Some,&quot; Four admitted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you asked it to let us go?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well? What did it say?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.&quot;&#10; &#10; At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.&#10;&quot;Fwiend,&quot; it said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, now,&quot; Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, &quot;that's no problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.&quot;&#10; &#10; In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, &quot;That's quite a sacrifice to ask, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Joyce" />
    <node id=" thirteen slender openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. &quot;That landing made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stop picking on Junior,&quot; Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. &quot;I'm sure he did the best he could.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Anybody talks about gravitational pull,&quot; Grampa said, snorting,&#10;&quot;deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing, Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred years ago.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Go back to your games, Grampa,&quot; Fred said impatiently. &quot;We've got work to do.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last button on his pircuit. The last light went out. &quot;You've got work to do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It belongs to all of" />
    <node id=" son. He was sixty and his hair had begun to gray at the temples. &quot;That landing was pretty rough, Junior.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. &quot;I know it, Fred,&quot; he said, frowning. &quot;This world fooled me. It has a diameter less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, &quot;Well, gosh, Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,&#10;'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium—'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's enough, Four,&quot; Junior interrupted. &quot;Never mind what I said.&quot;&#10; &#10; Those were the Peppergrass men" />
    <node id=" already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus, you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal points.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That may be,&quot; Junior said stubbornly, &quot;but I still want to know why this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,&quot; Reba said, her voice soft. &quot;No, here they come now.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Fweep obtains radioactive material by using ordinary substances on an atomic level. This is possible because his &quot;skin&quot; is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several feet of lead.&#10;2. The idea of making Fweep exceed the critical mass with enriched uranium, thus causing him to blow up, was suggested by Fred. However, Four dismissed this idea as impossible and potentially disastrous for them. Therefore, it seems unlikely and not recommended." />
    <node id=" &quot;What level does he use?&quot; Junior wanted to know.&#10; &#10; &quot;Point the scintillation counter at him.&quot;&#10; &#10; Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.&#10; &#10; Junior looked at the counter's dial. &quot;He's radioactive, all right. Not much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He uses ordinary matter,&quot; Four said. &quot;He must have used up the few deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?&quot; Junior said unbelievingly.&#10; &#10; Four nodded. &quot;And that 'skin' of his—whatever it is he uses for skin—is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several feet of lead.&quot;&#10; &#10; Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. &quot;Maybe we could feed him enough enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it might be a trifle more than" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Not now,&quot; said Four.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where've you been?&quot; Reba asked anxiously. &quot;What've you been doing?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've been all over Fweepland,&quot; Four said wearily, &quot;trying to locate its center of gravity.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well?&quot; Fred prompted.&#10; &#10; &quot;It shifts.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's impossible,&quot; said Junior.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not for Fweep,&quot; Four replied.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Joyce suspiciously asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;It shifted,&quot; Four explained patiently, &quot;because Fweep kept following me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fweep?&quot; Junior repeated stupidly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Fweep?&quot; Fweep said eagerly.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet so heavy. He's why we can't leave.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. &quot;I got it figured out" />
    <node id=" Four. &quot;Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats' everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him. Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times. Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around and wait for that thing to die?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'd have a long wait,&quot; Four observed. &quot;Fweep is the only one of his kind on this planet.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Probably he's immortal.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And he doesn't reproduce?&quot; Reba asked sympathetically.&#10; &#10; &quot;Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction. Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal creatures.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But he must have some way of reproduction,&quot; Reba argued. &quot;" />
    <node id=".&quot; Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had paused at Grampa's feet.&#10; &#10; Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path seemed crooked.&#10; &#10; Its gelatinous form jiggled. &quot;Hic!&quot; it said.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously toward the airlock. &quot;Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the polarizer turned on.&quot;&#10; &#10; The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred, followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary, scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.&#10; &#10; &quot;Any luck?&quot; Reba asked brightly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do we look it?&quot; Junior grumbled.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where's Joyce?&quot; asked Fred. &quot;Might as well get everybody in on this at once. Joyce!&quot;&#10; &#10; The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:&#10;&quot;Any uranium? Radium? Thor" />
    <node id=" the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. &quot;I got it figured out, Four,&quot; he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. &quot;A missionary takes over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not now, Grampa,&quot; Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making the grand tour of the cabin.&#10; &#10; The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them, absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.&#10; &#10; &quot;Rat poison?&quot; Four asked.&#10; &#10; Joyce started guiltily. &quot;How did you know?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There's no use trying to poison Fweep,&quot; Four said calmly. &quot;He's got no enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What level does he use?&quot; Junior wanted to know.&#10; &#10; &quot;Point the scintillation counter at him.&quot;&#10; &#10; Junior dug one of" />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.&quot; Four giggled at the thought.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Joyce glared at him furiously. &quot;Four! Act your age! We've got to do something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here at the whim of a mere blob!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't figure it's a whim,&quot; Grampa said. &quot;Circular gravity is what he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends the space-time continuum around him—conscious or subconscious, I don't know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the flivver won't move.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't care why that thing does it,&quot; Joyce said icily. &quot;I want it stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off, we'll just have to do away with it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How?&quot; asked Four. &quot;Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe," />
    <node id="1. When Reba said she thought Junior might grow into a man like his grandfather, she meant that she hoped Junior would develop the same positive qualities and traits that Grampa possesses. This is evident when she mentions seeing something in Junior that nobody else saw, implying her belief in his potential to become a better person. Grampa turned red at her comment because he was likely embarrassed by the compliment, as it suggested that Reba held him in high regard.&#10;2. Four is trying to figure out Fweep's abilities with particles by observing how the outer inch or two of Fweep's body becomes cloudy when he tries to analyze sweepings (presumably consisting of various particles). Four wants to understand how Fweep can manipulate and interact with these particles, as this knowledge could potentially help them leave the planet they are currently stranded on." />
    <node id=" said, surprised.&#10; &#10; &quot;I like you, gal. Never forget it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior would have had competition!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You bet he would!&quot; Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, &quot;Beats me why you ever married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.&quot;&#10; &#10; Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. &quot;Maybe I saw something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you and to himself, too.&quot; Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. &quot;And maybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring intently at Fweep. &quot;What you doing, Four?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,&quot; Four said absently. &quot;The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle" />
    <node id=" cause but a result.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What I can't understand,&quot; Junior said thoughtfully, &quot;is why the polarizer worked for a little while when we landed—long enough to keep us from being squashed—and then quit.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or where it came from,&quot; Four explained. &quot;All he knew was he didn't like linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's when we dropped.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?&quot; Grampa said.&#10;&quot;Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He's no more improbable than people,&quot; said Four.&#10; &#10; &quot;Less than some I've known,&quot; Grampa conceded.&#10; &#10; &quot;If he can eat anything,&quot; Reba said, &quot;why does he keep sweeping the cabin for dust and lint?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He wants to be helpful,&quot; Four replied without hesitation, &quot;and he's lonely. After all,&quot; he added wistfully, &quot;he's never had any friends.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How do you know all these things?&quot; Joyce asked from her" />
    <node id=" &#10; In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, &quot;That's quite a sacrifice to ask, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Joyce!&quot; Reba cried, horrified. &quot;Grampa was joking, but you actually mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind, Reba,&quot; Four said evenly. &quot;It was just what I was going to suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fwiend,&quot; said Fweep gently.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in front of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard swearing in a steady monotone.&#10; &#10; &quot;Junior!&quot; said Joyce, shocked.&#10; &#10; Junior swung around impatiently. &quot;Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing won't work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't expect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work, it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mother!&quot; Junior warned. &quot;We" />
    <node id="; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we want.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You know the law: one child per couple,&quot; Joyce reminded her frigidly.&#10;&quot;You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not me.&quot;&#10; &#10; Junior frowned at his wife. &quot;I believe you're actually glad it happened.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I could think of worse things,&quot; Reba said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I like your spunk, Reb,&quot; Grampa muttered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Speaking of children,&quot; Junior said, &quot;where's Four?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Here.&quot; Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room, carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round, raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.&#10; &#10; &quot;Fweep?&quot; it queried hopefully.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not now,&quot; said Four.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where've you been?&quot; Reba asked anxiously. &quot;What've you been doing?&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="Grampa is responsible for purchasing the space flivver and inventing the gravity polarizer. He also spent his wealth on unsuccessful ventures related to perpetual motion machines and longevity pills, and he fixed it so that they would have to search for uranium and habitable worlds throughout the galaxy." />
    <node id="'ve got work to do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It belongs to all of us,&quot; Four said shrilly. &quot;You gave us all a sixth share.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right, Four,&quot; Grampa muttered, &quot;so I did. But whose money bought it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You bought it, Grampa,&quot; Fred said.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You, Grampa,&quot; Fred said.&#10; &#10; &quot;You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and longevity pills,&quot; Joyce said bitterly, &quot;and fixed it so we'd have to go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly galaxy? You, Grampa!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, now,&quot; Grampa protested, &quot;I got a little put away yet. You'll be sorry when I'm dead and gone.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" professorially. &quot;Well, now, in ordinary light the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles or ellipses.&quot;&#10; &#10; The faces were still blank and unillumined.&#10; &#10; &quot;Gravity is similar to light,&quot; he pressed on. &quot;In the absence of matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.&quot;&#10; &#10; The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no longer. &quot;That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius. He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer. He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now wait a minute!&quot; Grampa protested." />
    <node id=" that the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.&#10; &#10; Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, &quot;If I were you, Junior, I would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,&quot; he amended. &quot;You can't be Four's father. All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the polarizer will polarize it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's just supposition,&quot; Junior said stubbornly. &quot;The fact is, it isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe the polarizer is broken,&quot; Fred suggested.&#10; &#10; Grampa snorted. &quot;Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And, anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then it goes deeper,&quot; Junior insisted. &quot;It goes right to the principle of" />
    <node id="The game that Grampa has been playing against a computer circuit he brought from Earth is a simple game where players take turns putting out one, two, or three lights. The player who makes the other turn out the last light is the winner. This game is divided into three sections of four lights each, and the player who moves second can always win if they use the right strategy. Grampa claims to have figured out this winning strategy, but he becomes upset when Four tries to help him or suggest a strategy. The game seems to be a source of both frustration and entertainment for Grampa." />
    <node id=",&quot; Four said absently. &quot;The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building me a pircuit?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You get the other one figured out?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It was easy,&quot; Grampa said breezily, &quot;once you understood the principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; Four agreed. &quot;I can make you a new one by cannibalizing the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.&quot;&#10; &#10; Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.&#10; &#10; Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. &quot;Thought you'd say that,&quot; he said, picking out the box. &quot;Help yourself.&quot; With the other hand, he lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. &quot;Ahhh!&quot; he sighed, wiped" />
    <node id=" lights. The player who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's simple,&quot; Four said without hesitation. &quot;The winning strategy is to—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't be a kibitzer!&quot; Grampa snapped. &quot;When I need help, I'll ask for it.

Didn't think you had it in you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Fred stood up apologetically. &quot;I'd better go calm her down,&quot; he muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.&#10; &#10; &quot;Give her one for me!&quot; Grampa called.&#10; &#10; Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like some reedy folk music.&#10; &#10; &quot;Makes you think, doesn't it?&quot; Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.&#10;&quot;Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What I can't understand,&quot; Junior said thoughtfully, &quot;is why the polarizer worked for a little while when" />
    <node id="1. The terms this alien beggar (Fweep) could dictate: It is not explicitly stated in the story what exact terms Fweep could dictate, but it is suggested that he has some level of control over the gravity of the planet, which allows him to prevent the Peppergrass family from leaving.&#10;&#10;2. How anyone can find out what they might be: The story implies that Fweep communicates through simple phrases and gestures, so it may be challenging to negotiate with him directly. However, the family could try to learn more about Fweep's abilities and limitations by observing his behavior and interactions with the planet's environment. They could also use their Abacus computer to analyze any patterns or correlations between Fweep's actions and gravitational anomalies on the planet. By gathering more information about Fweep and his powers, the family might be able to figure out a way to communicate with him effectively and negotiate their departure." />

It had been slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold, fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.&#10; &#10; As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then, at the last instant before impact, it stopped.

    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, Junior and his family chose the second planet they landed on because it showed signs of being unusually heavy for its size. They had fed all the orbital data into their computer, Abacus, which indicated that this planet's orbital perturbations suggested a high concentration of mass. When Fred saw these indicators, he speculated that it might be due to the presence of heavy metals or even uranium.&#10;&#10;Given their objective of searching for resources like uranium, radium, and thorium, this potential discovery made the second planet an attractive destination for Junior and his family. It is important to note that they had been unsuccessful in their search so far, as evidenced by their weary appearance and Fred's response to Reba's question about their luck.&#10;&#10;The stronger gravitational pull of the second planet was a notable feature, but it did not deter Junior and his family from choosing to land there. The story later reveals that this high gravity is due to the presence of Fweep, the living, raspberry-gelatin-like sphere they encountered on the planet. However, at the time of their decision, they were likely unaware of Fweep's existence and influence on the planet's gravity." />
    <node id="1. Grampa figured out the winning strategy for the game of lighting and extinguishing lights by understanding the principle that the player who moves second can always win if they divide the lights into three sections and make strategic moves.

For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why? Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?&quot;&#10; &#10; Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. &quot;Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Let's not get up on any pulpits,&quot; Fred growled. &quot;Come on, Grampa, what's the theory behind polarization?&quot;&#10; &#10; Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the jeering grin turned to a smile. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;at last.

When Reba said she thought Junior might grow into a man like his grandfather, she meant that she hoped Junior would develop the same positive qualities and traits that Grampa possesses. This is evident when she mentions seeing something in Junior that nobody else saw, implying her belief in his potential to become a better person. Grampa turned red at her comment because he was likely embarrassed by the compliment, as it suggested that Reba held him in high regard.&#10;2. Four is trying to understand how Fweep can manipulate and interact with particles, as this knowledge could potentially help them leave the planet they are currently stranded on. Four has observed that the outer inch or two of Fweep's body becomes cloudy when he tries to analyze sweepings, which presumably consist of various particles. By observing this reaction, Four hopes to gain insight into Fweep's abilities and how they might be able to use them to their advantage." />
    <node id="1. The Peppergrass men are explorers traveling in a spaceship (referred to as a &quot;flivver&quot;) that they purchased for $15,730. They are searching for valuable resources such as uranium, radium, and thorium throughout the galaxy.&#10;2. Grampa, the oldest member of the family, is responsible for buying the flivver and inventing its gravity polarizer. He has a history of investing in unsuccessful ventures related to perpetual motion machines and longevity pills. Grampa's pursuit of these projects depleted their wealth, forcing them to search for valuable resources and habitable worlds.&#10;3. The family chose the second planet they landed on because it showed signs of being unusually heavy for its size. They used their computer, Abacus, to analyze orbital data, which suggested a high concentration of mass on the planet due to orbital perturbations. Fred speculated that this might be due to the presence of heavy metals or uranium.&#10;4. The real reason for the stronger gravitational pull is the presence of Fweep, a living, raspberry-gelatin-like sphere that functions as a circular polarizer. Grampa's gravity polarizer in the flivver is a linear polarizer, which cannot handle this type of polarization. This mismatch, combined with Fweep's influence on the planet, results in an unusually high gravity that prevents the flivver from functioning properly and the family from leaving the planet." />
    <node id="1. The flivver on Fweepland is not working because it is equipped with a linear polarizer (invented by Grampa), while the living sphere Fweep functions as a circular polarizer. The mismatch between these two types of polarization prevents the flivver from functioning properly in the high-gravity environment caused by Fweep's influence on the planet.&#10;2. The planet's shifting center of gravity is related to Fweep, who follows Four around and causes the center of gravity to shift due to its circular polarizing abilities. This shift in gravity is what makes it difficult for the flivver to function and for the family to leave the planet." />
    <node id="The conflict between Joyce and Four revolves around the existence and presence of a living, sentient blob of raspberry gelatin named Fweep. Joyce is repulsed by Fweep's appearance and wants Four to remove it from her vicinity, while Four considers Fweep his friend and wishes to keep it close. The conflict escalates when Four reveals that they are currently stranded on Fweep's planet due to its unique properties as a circular polarizer, which neutralized Grampa's invention of a linear polarizer. Joyce continues to express her disgust and desire for separation from the creature, while Four remains attached and empathetic towards Fweep, who has never had any friends before." />
    <node id="1. The game Grampa has been playing on his newly activated circuit device that he brought from Earth is a simple game of lighting and extinguishing lights. There are thirteen slim lights on the circuit, divided into three sections of four lights each. Players take turns putting out one, two, or three lights. The player who makes the other turn out the last light is the winner. The strategy to winning this game lies in understanding that the player who moves second can always win if they divide the lights into three sections and make strategic moves. Grampa has figured out this winning strategy.&#10;&#10;To play the game, players alternate turns putting out one, two, or three lights. The goal is to avoid being the one who puts out the last light, as that player will lose. The winning strategy involves dividing the lights into three sections and making moves that force the opponent to disrupt their own sections, while the winning player maintains their sections and eventually leaves just one light left for the opponent to turn off, ensuring the winner's victory." />

The spare parts that Grampa has in a drawer next to his chair include nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. It is implied that these parts can be used to build the new circuit. However, the text does not provide specific details about the exact parts or components Four needs." />
    <node id="**Short answer:** Four has learned about Fweep's abilities, comforts, and feelings through their interactions and conversations with the creature. Additionally, Four's empathetic nature allows him to better understand and connect with Fweep.&#10;&#10;**Explanation:** Throughout the story, Four spends a significant amount of time with Fweep, trying to understand its abilities and capabilities. During this process, they engage in various conversations that allow Four to learn more about Fweep's unique traits, such as its circular polarization property, which is responsible for making their vehicle malfunction.&#10;&#10;As they spend more time together, Four becomes increasingly attuned to Fweep's feelings and comforts. For example, when Fweep rolls swiftly across the floor and bounces into Four's lap, he recognizes that it is nestling against him lovingly, indicating that Fweep considers Four a friend. Furthermore, Fweep expresses its emotions using the word &quot;fwiend,&quot; which Four understands to mean &quot;friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;Four's empathetic nature also contributes to his understanding of Fweep's abilities, comforts, and feelings. As an empathetic person, Four is able to connect with others on a deeper level, allowing him to better understand their emotions and experiences. This skill comes in handy when dealing with Fweep, as it helps Four recognize the creature's loneliness and desire for companionship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Four has learned about Fweep's abilities, comforts, and feelings through their interactions and conversations. Additionally, Four's empathetic nature enables him to better understand and connect with Fweep, allowing him to gain insights into the creature's unique traits and emotions." />
    <node id="Junior is having trouble getting Abacus, a computer, to work for simple arithmetic because the computer's polarizer is not functioning properly. The polarizer in the flivver, Grampa's invention, is a linear polarizer, but the living sphere they discovered on the planet, Fweep, functions as a circular polarizer. This difference in polarization is causing the high gravity on the planet and is affecting the functioning of the polarizer in the flivver, making it unable to move.&#10;&#10;Four, who is mentioned to be the only one who understands Abacus, is not currently trying to fix the computer because he is outside playing with Fweep in the meadow. Junior is trying to solve the problem on his own and is becoming increasingly frustrated with the malfunctioning computer and his mother's insistence that they cannot leave the planet without resolving the issue with Fweep." />
    <node id="'t a long, complicated calculation; it's a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about the cannibals and the missionaries.

    <node id="1. The creature named Fweep is responsible for the group's arrival on this planet due to its unique properties as a circular polarizer, which neutralized Grampa's invention of a linear polarizer, causing their space vehicle (flivver) to malfunction and crash on Fweepland.&#10;2. The group members have differing opinions about Fweep. Joyce is repulsed by Fweep's appearance and wants Four to remove it from her vicinity. Four considers Fweep his friend and wishes to keep it close, as Fweep has never had any friends before. Reba asks anxiously about Four's whereabouts, showing some concern for him. Fred prompts Four for an answer about the center of gravity, indicating that he may be interested in understanding the situation better. Junior repeats Four and Fweep's names, suggesting that he might not fully grasp the situation or its implications yet. Grampa, who invents the linear polarizer, has not directly expressed his opinion on Fweep in this excerpt but appears to have been trying to figure something out related to their situation." />
    <node id="1. Joyce's indignant outburst and departure to a private room was caused by the combination of her disgust towards Fweep, Grampa's sarcastic comment about leaving Four with Fweep, and Fred reminding her of her promise not to cause a fuss.

Never had the nerve.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, thanks, Grampa,&quot; Reba said, surprised.&#10; &#10; &quot;I like you, gal. Never forget it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I like you, too, Grampa. If" />
    <node id="1. The primary problem with the spaceship's (flivver) polarizer is that it is a linear polarizer, which cannot handle circular polarization. Fweep, the raspberry-gelatin-like creature they discovered on the planet, functions as a circular polarizer. This difference in polarization types is causing Grampa's invention to malfunction and preventing the flivver from functioning properly.&#10;2. The high gravity on the planet is also a result of Fweep's presence. Fweep's influence increases the gravity, making it difficult for the spaceship to move or take off. This issue is why Reba, Junior, Joyce, and Grampa cannot leave the fertile planet they have stumbled upon.&#10;3. The group must find a solution to this problem before they can successfully leave the planet and continue their search for uranium, radium, or thorium. Four, who seems to understand the situation better than the others, may play a crucial role in resolving this issue." />

Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our lives right here—involuntary colonists.&quot;&#10; &#10; Joyce spun on him. &quot;You're joking!&quot; she screeched.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wish I were,&quot; Junior said. &quot;But the polarizer won't work. Either it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that just won't polarize.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's these '23 models,&quot; Grampa put in disgustedly. &quot;They never were any good.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable spaceship rested on its improbable stern.

    <node id="1. Communicate and empathize with Fweep: It is essential to make an effort to understand Fweep's feelings and needs. By showing empathy towards the creature, you can build trust and create a positive relationship. Use simple language and repeat certain words, such as &quot;fwiend&quot; or &quot;Fweep,&quot; to help facilitate communication.&#10;2. Address Fweep's fear of linear polarization: Explain that the linear polarizer in the flivver is not harmful to Fweep or Fweepland. Use visual aids and simple explanations to help Fweep understand this concept better. You might also want to emphasize that Grampa's invention does not intend to cause any harm.&#10;3. Offer an alternative solution: Suggest using a circular polarizer in the flivver instead, which would be more compatible with Fweep and its properties. This change could help alleviate Fweep's concerns about linear polarization while also ensuring the group's safe departure from Fweepland.&#10;4. Reassure Fweep of Four's presence: Let Fweep know that Four will still be nearby, even after the group leaves Fweepland. Explain that they can continue their friendship and communicate through different means, such as radio waves or other forms of long-distance communication.&#10;5. Highlight the benefits for both parties: Emphasize that by allowing the group to leave Fweepland safely, Fweep can expand its social circle and have more friends. This expanded network could lead to new experiences and opportunities for Fweep, enriching its life and helping it grow as an individual.&#10;6. Encourage Fweep's cooperation: Praise Fweep for its abilities and contributions to the group's understanding of Fweepland. By acknowledging Fweep's importance and value, you can encourage the creature to cooperate and help the group leave the planet safely while maintaining their friendship." />

This discovery is significant because it suggests that the group may not be alone on this planet and could potentially find help or resources from these other life forms.&#10;2. Four rushes to the air lock despite Reba's warning, which indicates his urgency to investigate and connect with the fauna he has discovered. This action also shows Four's proactive nature and willingness to explore new possibilities for their survival and escape from the planet. However, it is important for him to consider Reba's warning, as interacting with the fauna could potentially bring unforeseen dangers or consequences to the group." />

    <node id="1. Fweep obtains radioactive material by using ordinary substances on an atomic level. This is possible because his &quot;skin&quot; is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several feet of lead. The exact method and process of how Fweep is able to convert ordinary substances into radioactive material is not specified in the story, but it can be inferred that it has something to do with manipulating particles at an atomic level.&#10;2. The composition of Fweep's &quot;skin&quot; is also not explicitly stated in the story, but it is mentioned that it is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several feet of lead. This implies that Fweep's skin has properties similar to those of heavy metals and other dense materials that are effective at blocking radiation. However, the story suggests that Fweep's skin is not a metal, but rather some kind of unique biological or technological material that is capable of stopping particle emissions more efficiently than lead." />

    <node id="1. The creature named Fweep has several unique characteristics. It is a living, sentient blob of raspberry gelatin that possesses the ability to communicate in a limited capacity, as indicated by its response &quot;Fwiend&quot; when asked if it considers Four to be its friend. Fweep also has the ability to move across surfaces by leaving behind a trail of cleanliness, which suggests an advanced understanding of atomic properties. Furthermore, Fweep can obtain radioactive material through manipulation of ordinary substances on an atomic level and its skin is highly efficient at stopping particle emissions, making it resistant to radiation.&#10;2. Joyce's unique characteristic is her strong aversion towards Fweep due to its appearance. This disgust, combined with Grampa's sarcastic comment about leaving Four with Fweep and Fred reminding her of her promise not to cause a fuss, leads to Joyce's indignant outburst and departure from the central cabin.&#10;&#10;The reason why it would be futile to attempt poisoning Fweep with rat poison is that Fweep has demonstrated advanced abilities related to atomic manipulation and resistance to radiation. Rat poison may not have any effect on Fweep due to its unique biological or technological composition, which allows it to stop particle emissions more efficiently than lead. Additionally, given Fweep's ability to obtain radioactive material through ordinary substances, it is possible that the creature could render the rat poison ineffective or even use it as a resource for further growth and development." />
    <node id="Based on the story and observation 1, Four's discovery of fauna on the planet suggests that there might be other life forms present in this environment. This is significant because it could potentially mean that the group may find help or resources from these other life forms for their survival and escape from the planet. However, Four's action of rushing to the air lock despite Reba's warning indicates his eagerness to investigate and connect with the fauna he has discovered but also highlights the importance of considering possible dangers or consequences of interacting with the fauna.&#10;&#10;Regarding the safety of the air, there is no specific information in the observation about the composition or quality of the air. Four's lack of concern could be due to his assumption that the air is safe based on his initial observations, or it might be that he has not yet considered this aspect. Reba's concern for macro-organisms suggests that she is aware of potential dangers they might pose and wants to exercise caution. However, Four may not share her worry because he is more focused on understanding and utilizing the fauna's properties rather than viewing them as threats.&#10;&#10;In summary, Four's discovery of fauna on the planet could potentially lead to finding help or resources for their survival and escape. His lack of concern for macro-organisms might be due to his focus on understanding the fauna's properties or a lack of information about potential dangers in the air. It is crucial for the group to remain vigilant and consider all possible risks while exploring this new environment." />

You play against the pircuit, taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights.

The principle that Grampa figured out is that the player who moves second can always win if they divide the lights into three sections and make strategic moves. This strategy allows them to force their opponent to disrupt their own sections, while the winning player maintains their sections and eventually leaves just one light left for the opponent to turn off, ensuring their victory.&#10;2.

Additionally, Four's empathetic nature allows him to better understand and connect with Fweep.&#10;&#10;**Explanation:** Throughout the story, Four spends a significant amount of time with Fweep, trying to understand its abilities and capabilities. During this process, they engage in various conversations that allow Four to learn more about Fweep's unique traits, such as its circular polarization property, which is responsible for making their vehicle malfunction.&#10;&#10;As they spend more time together, Four becomes increasingly attuned to Fweep's feelings and comforts. For example, when Fweep rolls swiftly across the floor and bounces into Four's lap, he recognizes that it is nestling against him lovingly, indicating that Fweep considers Four a friend. Furthermore, Fweep expresses its emotions using the word &quot;fwiend,&quot; which Four understands to mean &quot;friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;Four's empathetic nature also contributes to his understanding of Fweep's abilities, comforts, and feelings. As an empathetic person, Four is able to connect with others on a deeper level, allowing him to better understand their emotions and experiences. This skill comes in handy when dealing with Fweep, as it helps Four recognize the creature's loneliness and desire for companionship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Four has learned about Fweep's abilities, comforts, and feelings through their interactions and conversations. Additionally, Four's empathetic nature enables him to better understand and connect with Fweep, allowing him to gain insights into the creature's unique traits and emotions.">

The Peppergrass men are explorers traveling in a spaceship (referred to as a &quot;flivver&quot;) that they purchased for $15,730. They are searching for valuable resources such as uranium, radium, and thorium throughout the galaxy.&#10;2. Grampa, the oldest member of the family, is responsible for buying the flivver and inventing its gravity polarizer. He has a history of investing in unsuccessful ventures related to perpetual motion machines and longevity pills. Grampa's pursuit of these projects depleted their wealth, forcing them to search for valuable resources and habitable worlds.&#10;3. The family chose the second planet they landed on because it showed signs of being unusually heavy for its size. They used their computer, Abacus, to analyze orbital data, which suggested a high concentration of mass on the planet due to orbital perturbations. Fred speculated that this might be due to the presence of heavy metals or uranium.&#10;4. The real reason for the stronger gravitational pull is the presence of Fweep, a living, raspberry-gelatin-like sphere that functions as a circular polarizer. Grampa's gravity polarizer in the flivver is a linear polarizer, which cannot handle this type of polarization. This mismatch, combined with Fweep's influence on the planet, results in an unusually high gravity that prevents the flivver from functioning properly and the family from leaving the planet.">

Fweep, the raspberry-gelatin-like creature they discovered on the planet, functions as a circular polarizer. This difference in polarization types is causing Grampa's invention to malfunction and preventing the flivver from functioning properly.&#10;2. The high gravity on the planet is also a result of Fweep's presence. Fweep's influence increases the gravity, making it difficult for the spaceship to move or take off. This issue is why Reba, Junior, Joyce, and Grampa cannot leave the fertile planet they have stumbled upon.&#10;3. The group must find a solution to this problem before they can successfully leave the planet and continue their search for uranium, radium, or thorium.

By showing empathy towards the creature, you can build trust and create a positive relationship. Use simple language and repeat certain words, such as &quot;fwiend&quot; or &quot;Fweep,&quot; to help facilitate communication.&#10;2. Address Fweep's fear of linear polarization: Explain that the linear polarizer in the flivver is not harmful to Fweep or Fweepland. Use visual aids and simple explanations to help Fweep understand this concept better. You might also want to emphasize that Grampa's invention does not intend to cause any harm.&#10;3.

This change could help alleviate Fweep's concerns about linear polarization while also ensuring the group's safe departure from Fweepland.&#10;4. Reassure Fweep of Four's presence: Let Fweep know that Four will still be nearby, even after the group leaves Fweepland. Explain that they can continue their friendship and communicate through different means, such as radio waves or other forms of long-distance communication.&#10;5. Highlight the benefits for both parties: Emphasize that by allowing the group to leave Fweepland safely, Fweep can expand its social circle and have more friends.

Encourage Fweep's cooperation: Praise Fweep for its abilities and contributions to the group's understanding of Fweepland.

The game Grampa has been playing on his newly activated circuit device that he brought from Earth is a simple game of lighting and extinguishing lights. There are thirteen slim lights on the circuit, divided into three sections of four lights each. Players take turns putting out one, two, or three lights. The player who makes the other turn out the last light is the winner. The strategy to winning this game lies in understanding that the player who moves second can always win if they divide the lights into three sections and make strategic moves. Grampa has figured out this winning strategy.&#10;&#10;To play the game, players alternate turns putting out one, two, or three lights. The goal is to avoid being the one who puts out the last light, as that player will lose. The winning strategy involves dividing the lights into three sections and making moves that force the opponent to disrupt their own sections, while the winning player maintains their sections and eventually leaves just one light left for the opponent to turn off, ensuring the winner's victory.">

The primary problem with the spaceship's (flivver) polarizer is that it is a linear polarizer, which cannot handle circular polarization. Fweep, the raspberry-gelatin-like creature they discovered on the planet, functions as a circular polarizer. This difference in polarization types is causing Grampa's invention to malfunction and preventing the flivver from functioning properly.&#10;2. The high gravity on the planet is also a result of Fweep's presence. Fweep's influence increases the gravity, making it difficult for the spaceship to move or take off. This issue is why Reba, Junior, Joyce, and Grampa cannot leave the fertile planet they have stumbled upon.&#10;3. The group must find a solution to this problem before they can successfully leave the planet and continue their search for uranium, radium, or thorium. Four, who seems to understand the situation better than the others, may play a crucial role in resolving this issue.">

This disgust, combined with Grampa's sarcastic comment about leaving Four with Fweep and Fred reminding her of her promise not to cause a fuss, leads to Joyce's indignant outburst and departure from the central cabin.&#10;&#10;The reason why it would be futile to attempt poisoning Fweep with rat poison is that Fweep has demonstrated advanced abilities related to atomic manipulation and resistance to radiation. Rat poison may not have any effect on Fweep due to its unique biological or technological composition, which allows it to stop particle emissions more efficiently than lead. Additionally, given Fweep's ability to obtain radioactive material through ordinary substances, it is possible that the creature could render the rat poison ineffective or even use it as a resource for further growth and development.">

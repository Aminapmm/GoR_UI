The speaker's emotions are fueled by his desire to right the wrongs done to his people and ensure that the &quot;guilt&quot; does not go unpunished.&#10;&#10;The appearance of his mother affects his emotions by providing a momentary respite from his rage and a sense of divine intervention in his life. The vision of his mother, who appears as a radiant figure, offers him comfort and reassurance that he is not alone in his struggles. However, the message she delivers focuses on the need for him to save himself and his family from the destruction of Troy, rather than addressing his desire for vengeance against the &quot;strumpet.&quot; This message serves to shift his emotional state from rage to a sense of urgency and responsibility towards his loved ones' safety." />

    <node id="In the narrative, Polites is introduced as one of Priam's sons who was pursued and killed by Pyrrhus (also known as Neoptolemus) near an altar, where Priam, his father, and Hecuba, his mother, were taking shelter. The laurel tree next to the altar provided little protection for Polites as he was transfixed by Pyrrhus' lance and died with &quot;lamentable cries&quot; in front of his father's eyes (Virgil, Aeneid II:506-517).&#10;&#10;Priam, witnessing the brutal killing of his son, questioned the justice of the gods by saying, &quot;The gods...requite thy brutal rage! As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, if there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just&quot; (Aeneid II:518-520). This quote shows Priam's disillusionment with the divine, as he questions why such a heinous act could be allowed to happen.&#10;&#10;The story of Polites is a tragic one that highlights the brutality of war and its impact on families. His death served as a catalyst for Priam's own demise, as he was subsequently killed by Pyrrhus at the altar where his son died (Aeneid II:521-558). The story also serves to underscore Virgil's exploration of the role of divine justice in human affairs and raises questions about the nature of war, morality, and humanity." />

    <node id="1. Lack of Belief in Prophecy: The Trojans' decision to bring the horse into their city, despite Cassandra's warnings and other ominous signs, highlights their lack of belief in prophetic warnings. This lack of faith in the divine intervention contributes to the tragic outcome for Troy.&#10;2. Arrogance and Overconfidence: The Trojans' victory over the Greeks, coupled with their pride and overconfidence, might have led them to underestimate potential threats. They celebrate their perceived victory by bringing the horse as a trophy into their city, unaware that it hides their impending doom.&#10;3. Fulfillment of Prophecy: By bringing the Trojan horse into their city, the Trojans inadvertently fulfill Cassandra's prophecy, ultimately sealing their own fate. This highlights the themes of tragic heroism and the power of destiny in shaping human actions and consequences.&#10;4. Foreshadowing: The Trojans bringing the horse into their city foreshadows the impending doom that awaits them. It serves as a visual representation of the deception and betrayal that ultimately lead to Troy's downfall, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and skepticism in dealing with unfamiliar or seemingly harmless objects.&#10;5. Irony: The fact that the Trojans bring the horse into their city as a symbol of victory unwittingly brings about their own destruction, showcasing a strong element of irony. This serves to further emphasize the tragic nature of the story and the consequences of human actions motivated by pride, arrogance, and lack of belief in divine intervention." />

He warned that if the horse were to be brought into the city, Troy would prosper and burn cities like Argos and Mycenae instead. However, if the Trojans violated the offering by bringing it inside their walls, the goddess would destroy Troy in retaliation.

Therefore, Aeneas should persuade his father to leave Troy and escape with him, along with his own son Ascanius (also known as Iulus).

    <node id="Based on the supporting materials provided, the Greek warrior Diomedes did not directly convince the Trojans to bring the wooden horse into their city.

    <node id="During Troy's last and fatal night, the Greeks, who were compelled by destiny and had grown weary of the prolonged war, constructed a large wooden structure that resembled a monstrously sized steed. This was done with Minerva's aid.

However, if they violated the offering by bringing it inside their walls, the goddess would destroy Troy in retaliation.&#10;&#10;Despite Laocoon's warning to beware of Greeks bearing gifts, the Trojans, driven by their lack of belief in prophetic warnings, arrogance, and overconfidence after their victory over the Greeks, brought the horse into their city.

    <node id="Laocoon, a priest of Poseidon, attempts to strike the Trojan horse with his spear and warns the Trojans not to trust the Greeks bearing gifts. This action and these warnings hold great significance in the context of the impending fall of Troy:&#10;&#10;1. Symbolic Act of Defiance: Laocoon's spear strike on the Trojan horse represents a symbolic act of defiance against deception and betrayal. It shows his suspicion and intuition that something is amiss with the seemingly harmless gift from the Greeks.&#10;2. Foreshadowing Destruction: Laocoon's action serves as another layer of foreshadowing for Troy's destruction, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and skepticism in dealing with unfamiliar or seemingly harmless objects.&#10;3. Confirmation of Suspicions: Although Laocoon's spear strike does not destroy the horse, it confirms his suspicions about its true nature to those who are willing to listen and believe him. His warnings highlight the arrogance, overconfidence, and lack of belief in prophetic warnings displayed by the Trojans.&#10;4. Divine Intervention: Shortly after Laocoon's attempt to expose the horse's deception, he is punished by the gods with serpent attacks, further solidifying his role as a cautionary figure for the Trojans. This divine intervention highlights the tragic consequences of ignoring prophetic warnings and serves to underscore the impending doom of Troy.&#10;5. Reminder of Human Hubris: Laocoon's futile attempt to destroy the horse also serves as a reminder of human hubris, emphasizing that even when one tries to defy fate or destiny, they are ultimately subject to the will of the gods and their own limitations." />
    <node id="In the narrative you provided, it was not actually Odysseus (also known as Ulysses) who convinced the Trojans to bring the wooden horse into their city.

    <node id="1. The purpose of Coroebus' plan is to deceive the Trojans into thinking that the Greeks have abandoned their campaign and that the remaining Greek soldiers are now fighting on the Trojan side. This is achieved by having the Greeks disguise themselves as Trojans by wearing the armor of fallen Greek soldiers.&#10;&#10;2. Coroebus' plan ultimately leads to their defeat because it contributes to the overconfidence and arrogance of the Trojans, who believe they have finally won the war. This causes them to let their guard down and ignore warnings from prophets like Laocoon and Cassandra. As a result, when the Greeks hidden inside the Trojan Horse emerge at night, the Trojans are caught off-guard, leading to the sack of Troy and the defeat of the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In summary, Coroebus' plan to have the Greeks disguise themselves as Trojans is a successful deception that contributes to the Trojans' overconfidence and arrogance, ultimately leading to their downfall when the Greeks hidden in the Trojan Horse emerge to sack the city." />

    <node id="In this scene of divine intervention from Virgil's Aeneid, several gods are involved in bringing about the destruction of Troy. Neptune, the god of the sea, is located &quot;below the wall's foundation&quot; where a &quot;disorder'd heap of ruin lies.&quot; He wields his mace to heave the building away from its solid base, contributing to the city's devastation.&#10;&#10;Juno, the queen of the gods and wife of Jove, stands &quot;full in the Scaean gate&quot; with loud commands, urging on the tardy Grecian bands. This indicates her role in aiding the Greeks and spurring them to action against Troy.&#10;&#10;Pallas Athena, or Pallas, is described as bestriding the tower, &quot;refulgent thro' the cloud.&quot; Her snaky buckler signifies her divine association with wisdom, warfare, and the protection of cities. Her presence on the tower emphasizes her role in the destruction of Troy.&#10;&#10;Jove, also known as Jupiter or Zeus, is mentioned as supplying new courage to the foe, thereby aiding the Greeks against the town. This shows partiality among the deities towards the Greek side, further contributing to the tragic fate of Troy.&#10;&#10;In summary, Neptune works to undermine the structural integrity of Troy, Juno commands the Grecian troops, Pallas takes her position on the tower, and Jove provides assistance to the Greeks. The gods' actions collectively lead to the destruction of Troy as they fulfill the prophecy of Cassandra and seal the city's doom." />

    <node id="The Trojans' situation changed from favorable to unfavorable after they brought the wooden horse into their city. This shift was influenced by the actions of Pallas Athena and the advice of Calchas, a Greek seer. According to the supporting materials, when the statue of Pallas Athena was placed on the ground, she cast &quot;glaring eyes around&quot; and &quot;distill'd a briny sweat.&quot; This was interpreted as a sign that the goddess was displeased with the Trojans for bringing the horse into their city.&#10;&#10;Calchas, an army diviner, advised the Greeks to sail back to Greece and not expect conquest in the war until they returned with Pallas's favor. He urged them to hope for better omens and plead with the injured goddess. Following Calchas's advice, the Greek navy set sail for Greece, intending to return with Pallas Athena's approval. This development left the Trojans in a precarious position, as they had ignored the warnings of Laocoon and Cassandra, allowing their initial victory celebration and overconfidence to blind them from the dire consequences that followed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Trojans' situation changed from favorable to unfavorable due to Pallas Athena's displeasure at having her statue placed within the city walls. Calchas' advice to the Greek army further exacerbated the situation by prompting them to leave Troy and return with better omens, effectively abandoning their deception only to potentially regroup and strike again when they had Pallas Athena's approval. The Trojans' failure to heed prophetic warnings, combined with their arrogance and overconfidence, contributed significantly to this turn of events." />

    <node id="In the passage provided, a strange occurrence took place on young Iulus' (also known as Ascanius) head as his family prepared to flee Troy.

He asked if any vows could bend Jove's will, indicating that he interpreted the lambent flame on Iulus' head as a positive sign or message from the gods regarding their impending escape.

Apollo's priest Heus and his grandson Pantheus have arrived at the speaker's door, seeking refuge from the chaos. They mention that Troy is no more, Ilium was a town, indicating that the city has been significantly damaged or destroyed. The reason for this devastation is the unexpected arrival of a large force of enemies who have emerged from the bowels of a wooden horse. This suggests that the famous Trojan horse deception has been successful, and the Greek forces within it have now infiltrated and begun to destroy the city. Overall, the passage paints a picture of impending doom for Troy and its inhabitants." />
    <node id="The passage you provided seems to be a mix of two different narratives. One is related to the rival winds and Nereus striking the deep from a mythological or poetic context, while the other part describes Ajax, the Thessalian horse, and the fate of certain Greek warriors during the Trojan War.&#10;&#10;In an attempt to answer your question, I will focus on the second narrative involving Ajax and the Thessalian horse:&#10;&#10;When Ajax and the Thessalian horse join forces, they contribute to a situation where previously defeated troops reappear and enclose the rear of the Greeks. This development contributes to their defeat and the death of several notable Greek warriors, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus.&#10;&#10;Coroebus was a Greek warrior from Elis who had devised a plan with Odysseus (not mentioned in your passage) to deceive the Trojans into thinking that the Greeks had abandoned their campaign and that the remaining Greek soldiers were now fighting on the Trojan side. This plan, however, eventually leads to their defeat due to the overconfidence and arrogance it breeds among the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus were also Greek warriors who lost their lives during this battle. The text does not provide specific details about these individuals, but they are mentioned as having notable qualities.&#10;&#10;The defeat of the Greeks in this scenario is a result of several factors, including Ajax and the Thessalian horse joining forces with previously defeated troops, the deception plan by Coroebus, and the Trojans' overconfidence and arrogance after their victory over the Greeks. This tragic outcome underscores themes of tragic heroism, the power of destiny, and human actions leading to unintended consequences." />

The purpose of Coroebus' plan is to deceive the Trojans into thinking that the Greeks have abandoned their campaign and that the remaining Greek soldiers are now fighting on the Trojan side. This is achieved by having the Greeks disguise themselves as Trojans by wearing the armor of fallen Greek soldiers.&#10;&#10;2. Coroebus' plan ultimately leads to their defeat because it contributes to the overconfidence and arrogance of the Trojans, who believe they have finally won the war. This causes them to let their guard down and ignore warnings from prophets like Laocoon and Cassandra. As a result, when the Greeks hidden inside the Trojan Horse emerge at night, the Trojans are caught off-guard, leading to the sack of Troy and the defeat of the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In summary, Coroebus' plan to have the Greeks disguise themselves as Trojans is a successful deception that contributes to the Trojans' overconfidence and arrogance, ultimately leading to their downfall when the Greeks hidden in the Trojan Horse emerge to sack the city.">

Deceitful Tale of the Trojan Horse: The tale presented by the Greek warrior hidden within the Trojan horse was that the horse had been built as an offering to Pallas Athena, meant to atone for the theft of her statue and the betrayal of her temple during the sack of Troy.

However, if the Trojans violated the offering by bringing it inside their walls, the goddess would destroy Troy in retaliation. This cleverly manipulated the fears and superstitions of the Trojans, convincing them to let the horse into their city by loosening its fetters.">

This action and these warnings hold great significance in the context of the impending fall of Troy:&#10;&#10;1. Symbolic Act of Defiance: Laocoon's spear strike on the Trojan horse represents a symbolic act of defiance against deception and betrayal. It shows his suspicion and intuition that something is amiss with the seemingly harmless gift from the Greeks.&#10;2. Foreshadowing Destruction: Laocoon's action serves as another layer of foreshadowing for Troy's destruction, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and skepticism in dealing with unfamiliar or seemingly harmless objects.&#10;3. Confirmation of Suspicions: Although Laocoon's spear strike does not destroy the horse, it confirms his suspicions about its true nature to those who are willing to listen and believe him. His warnings highlight the arrogance, overconfidence, and lack of belief in prophetic warnings displayed by the Trojans.&#10;4. Divine Intervention: Shortly after Laocoon's attempt to expose the horse's deception, he is punished by the gods with serpent attacks, further solidifying his role as a cautionary figure for the Trojans. This divine intervention highlights the tragic consequences of ignoring prophetic warnings and serves to underscore the impending doom of Troy.&#10;5. Reminder of Human Hubris: Laocoon's futile attempt to destroy the horse also serves as a reminder of human hubris, emphasizing that even when one tries to defy fate or destiny, they are ultimately subject to the will of the gods and their own limitations.">

Her presence on the tower emphasizes her role in the destruction of Troy.&#10;&#10;Jove, also known as Jupiter or Zeus, is mentioned as supplying new courage to the foe, thereby aiding the Greeks against the town. This shows partiality among the deities towards the Greek side, further contributing to the tragic fate of Troy.&#10;&#10;In summary, Neptune works to undermine the structural integrity of Troy, Juno commands the Grecian troops, Pallas takes her position on the tower, and Jove provides assistance to the Greeks.

This action and these warnings hold great significance in the context of the impending fall of Troy:&#10;&#10;1. Symbolic Act of Defiance: Laocoon's spear strike on the Trojan horse represents a symbolic act of defiance against deception and betrayal. It shows his suspicion and intuition that something is amiss with the seemingly harmless gift from the Greeks.&#10;2. Foreshadowing Destruction: Laocoon's action serves as another layer of foreshadowing for Troy's destruction, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and skepticism in dealing with unfamiliar or seemingly harmless objects.&#10;3. Confirmation of Suspicions: Although Laocoon's spear strike does not destroy the horse, it confirms his suspicions about its true nature to those who are willing to listen and believe him. His warnings highlight the arrogance, overconfidence, and lack of belief in prophetic warnings displayed by the Trojans.&#10;4. Divine Intervention: Shortly after Laocoon's attempt to expose the horse's deception, he is punished by the gods with serpent attacks, further solidifying his role as a cautionary figure for the Trojans. This divine intervention highlights the tragic consequences of ignoring prophetic warnings and serves to underscore the impending doom of Troy.&#10;5. Reminder of Human Hubris: Laocoon's futile attempt to destroy the horse also serves as a reminder of human hubris, emphasizing that even when one tries to defy fate or destiny, they are ultimately subject to the will of the gods and their own limitations.">

This development contributes to their defeat and the death of several notable Greek warriors, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus.&#10;&#10;Coroebus was a Greek warrior from Elis who had devised a plan with Odysseus (not mentioned in your passage) to deceive the Trojans into thinking that the Greeks had abandoned their campaign and that the remaining Greek soldiers were now fighting on the Trojan side. This plan, however, eventually leads to their defeat due to the overconfidence and arrogance it breeds among the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus were also Greek warriors who lost their lives during this battle. The text does not provide specific details about these individuals, but they are mentioned as having notable qualities.&#10;&#10;The defeat of the Greeks in this scenario is a result of several factors, including Ajax and the Thessalian horse joining forces with previously defeated troops, the deception plan by Coroebus, and the Trojans' overconfidence and arrogance after their victory over the Greeks. This tragic outcome underscores themes of tragic heroism, the power of destiny, and human actions leading to unintended consequences.">

He urged them to hope for better omens and plead with the injured goddess. Following Calchas's advice, the Greek navy set sail for Greece, intending to return with Pallas Athena's approval. This development left the Trojans in a precarious position, as they had ignored the warnings of Laocoon and Cassandra, allowing their initial victory celebration and overconfidence to blind them from the dire consequences that followed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Trojans' situation changed from favorable to unfavorable due to Pallas Athena's displeasure at having her statue placed within the city walls. Calchas' advice to the Greek army further exacerbated the situation by prompting them to leave Troy and return with better omens, effectively abandoning their deception only to potentially regroup and strike again when they had Pallas Athena's approval. The Trojans' failure to heed prophetic warnings, combined with their arrogance and overconfidence, contributed significantly to this turn of events.">

This development contributes to their defeat and the death of several notable Greek warriors, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus.&#10;&#10;Coroebus was a Greek warrior from Elis who had devised a plan with Odysseus (not mentioned in your passage) to deceive the Trojans into thinking that the Greeks had abandoned their campaign and that the remaining Greek soldiers were now fighting on the Trojan side. This plan, however, eventually leads to their defeat due to the overconfidence and arrogance it breeds among the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus were also Greek warriors who lost their lives during this battle. The text does not provide specific details about these individuals, but they are mentioned as having notable qualities.&#10;&#10;The defeat of the Greeks in this scenario is a result of several factors, including Ajax and the Thessalian horse joining forces with previously defeated troops, the deception plan by Coroebus, and the Trojans' overconfidence and arrogance after their victory over the Greeks. This tragic outcome underscores themes of tragic heroism, the power of destiny, and human actions leading to unintended consequences.">

Instead, another unnamed Greek warrior hidden within the horse told the Trojans that the horse had been built as an offering to Pallas Athena to atone for the theft of her statue and the betrayal of her temple during the sack of Troy. The warrior warned that if the Trojans brought the horse into their city, they would prosper and burn cities like Argos and Mycenae instead. However, if they violated the offering by bringing it inside their walls, the goddess would destroy Troy in retaliation.&#10;&#10;Odysseus played a significant role in the Trojan War, but he was not directly involved in this particular deception concerning the Trojan horse. The consequences that the Greek warrior warned the Trojans about were that they would fulfill Cassandra's prophecy and ultimately seal their own fate, leading to the destruction of their city. This highlights the themes of tragic heroism and the power of destiny in shaping human actions and consequences." target="In this scene of divine intervention from Virgil's Aeneid, several gods are involved in bringing about the destruction of Troy. Neptune, the god of the sea, is located &quot;below the wall's foundation&quot; where a &quot;disorder'd heap of ruin lies.&quot; He wields his mace to heave the building away from its solid base, contributing to the city's devastation.&#10;&#10;Juno, the queen of the gods and wife of Jove, stands &quot;full in the Scaean gate&quot; with loud commands, urging on the tardy Grecian bands. This indicates her role in aiding the Greeks and spurring them to action against Troy.&#10;&#10;Pallas Athena, or Pallas, is described as bestriding the tower, &quot;refulgent thro' the cloud.&quot; Her snaky buckler signifies her divine association with wisdom, warfare, and the protection of cities. Her presence on the tower emphasizes her role in the destruction of Troy.&#10;&#10;Jove, also known as Jupiter or Zeus, is mentioned as supplying new courage to the foe, thereby aiding the Greeks against the town. This shows partiality among the deities towards the Greek side, further contributing to the tragic fate of Troy.&#10;&#10;In summary, Neptune works to undermine the structural integrity of Troy, Juno commands the Grecian troops, Pallas takes her position on the tower, and Jove provides assistance to the Greeks. The gods' actions collectively lead to the destruction of Troy as they fulfill the prophecy of Cassandra and seal the city's doom.">

    <edge source="The Trojans' situation changed from favorable to unfavorable after they brought the wooden horse into their city. This shift was influenced by the actions of Pallas Athena and the advice of Calchas, a Greek seer. According to the supporting materials, when the statue of Pallas Athena was placed on the ground, she cast &quot;glaring eyes around&quot; and &quot;distill'd a briny sweat.&quot; This was interpreted as a sign that the goddess was displeased with the Trojans for bringing the horse into their city.&#10;&#10;Calchas, an army diviner, advised the Greeks to sail back to Greece and not expect conquest in the war until they returned with Pallas's favor. He urged them to hope for better omens and plead with the injured goddess. Following Calchas's advice, the Greek navy set sail for Greece, intending to return with Pallas Athena's approval. This development left the Trojans in a precarious position, as they had ignored the warnings of Laocoon and Cassandra, allowing their initial victory celebration and overconfidence to blind them from the dire consequences that followed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Trojans' situation changed from favorable to unfavorable due to Pallas Athena's displeasure at having her statue placed within the city walls. Calchas' advice to the Greek army further exacerbated the situation by prompting them to leave Troy and return with better omens, effectively abandoning their deception only to potentially regroup and strike again when they had Pallas Athena's approval.

    <edge source="The passage you provided seems to be a mix of two different narratives. One is related to the rival winds and Nereus striking the deep from a mythological or poetic context, while the other part describes Ajax, the Thessalian horse, and the fate of certain Greek warriors during the Trojan War.&#10;&#10;In an attempt to answer your question, I will focus on the second narrative involving Ajax and the Thessalian horse:&#10;&#10;When Ajax and the Thessalian horse join forces, they contribute to a situation where previously defeated troops reappear and enclose the rear of the Greeks. This development contributes to their defeat and the death of several notable Greek warriors, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus.&#10;&#10;Coroebus was a Greek warrior from Elis who had devised a plan with Odysseus (not mentioned in your passage) to deceive the Trojans into thinking that the Greeks had abandoned their campaign and that the remaining Greek soldiers were now fighting on the Trojan side. This plan, however, eventually leads to their defeat due to the overconfidence and arrogance it breeds among the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus were also Greek warriors who lost their lives during this battle. The text does not provide specific details about these individuals, but they are mentioned as having notable qualities.&#10;&#10;The defeat of the Greeks in this scenario is a result of several factors, including Ajax and the Thessalian horse joining forces with previously defeated troops, the deception plan by Coroebus, and the Trojans' overconfidence and arrogance after their victory over the Greeks.

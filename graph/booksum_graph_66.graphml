    <node id="1. The Trojans, bolstered by the addition of Ajax and the Thessalian horse, initially believe they have gained a significant advantage in their conflict with the Greeks.&#10;2. However, this newfound strength ultimately proves to be their undoing when the Greek soldiers strategically scatter and reappear from different directions, surrounding and attacking the Trojans from behind.&#10;3. The Trojans are further handicapped by their diverse speech and unfamiliarity with each other's armor, making them easy targets for the well-coordinated Greeks.&#10;4. In the ensuing chaos, several notable Trojans meet their demise:&#10;&#09;* Coroebus is killed at the altar of Pallas by Peneleus.&#10;&#09;* Ripheus, who is described as just and observant of right, also falls in the unequal fight.&#10;&#09;* Dymas and Hypanis are mistakenly slain by their fellow Trojans.&#10;&#09;* Pantheus, Apollo's priest, is unable to escape the Greek swords and perishes despite seeking refuge in the temple of Minerva.&#10;5. The Trojan women and children, including Cassandra, are dragged away by their captors as the city of Troy falls to its enemies. This tragic outcome serves to underscore the devastating consequences of the Trojans' ill-fated alliance with Ajax and the Thessalian horse." />

    <node id="1. In the given narrative, Anchises, the father of Aeneas, is initially reluctant to flee Troy with his son due to his strong sense of duty and commitment towards their homeland, even when warned by the divine specter about the impending doom of Troy.&#10;2. Aeneas should respect his father's wishes but also ensure their safety by insisting on leaving Troy, as it is evident that staying in the city will lead to their destruction.&#10;3. Aeneas must find a way to reconcile his filial duty to obey his father with the need to protect him and their future generations, like his son Ascanius, by escaping from the imminent catastrophe.&#10;4. As the narrative unfolds, Anchises eventually accepts the reality of the situation and aids Aeneas in leaving Troy with divine assistance, showcasing that sometimes it takes time for individuals to accept change, especially when deeply rooted in their traditions and homeland." />

    <node id="1. The &quot;strange figure's&quot; appearance: The &quot;strange figure&quot; mentioned here is likely Laocoon, a Trojan priest who warned against bringing the wooden horse into Troy. His appearance and trembling could have been due to his fear of the Grecian soldiers hidden inside the horse, or perhaps an embodiment of a prophetic vision he experienced.&#10;&#10;2. Claims about the Grecians resolving to raise the siege: Laocoon's speech emphasizes that the Trojans were deceived by the Grecian ruse because they wanted to believe in a peaceful resolution to the war, and their wishful thinking made them ignore the warnings of danger. This shows how the Grecians took advantage of the Trojans' hopes for an end to the conflict.&#10;&#10;3. Prodigies that amazed their souls: The appearance of prodigies like meteors, thunders, and other omens were seen as messages from the gods, hinting at the impending destruction of Troy. These signs would have further solidified Laocoon's warnings to the Trojans.&#10;&#10;4. Raising of the stupendous pile: The construction of the wooden horse was the most significant prodigy and served as a symbol for both sides in the conflict. To the Greeks, it represented their cunning deception and victory. Meanwhile, for the Trojans, the horse came to represent their gullibility, as they believed that it would bring them peace instead of destruction. The raising of this stupendous pile foreshadowed Troy's fall and served as a turning point in the narrative, emphasizing the tragic consequences of misplaced trust and belief in deceptive appearances." />

    <node id="Polites is one of Priam's sons, who became a victim of the brutal violence during the fall of Troy. As the city was being sacked, Polites was pursued by Pyrrhus (also known as Neoptolemus), who was seeking revenge against Priam and his family. In his flight, Polites rushed through swords and foes, seeking safety, but Pyrrhus continued to pursue him with his lance. Eventually, Polites was transfixed by one of Pyrrhus' thrusts and died, with his father, Priam, witnessing the tragic event.&#10;&#10;Deeply affected by his son's murder, Priam expressed his anger towards Pyrrhus and called upon the gods to avenge this brutal act. The laurel tree, near which Polites was killed, symbolizes the sanctity of the household gods and serves as a stark contrast to the violent acts being committed against the Trojan family.&#10;&#10;Polites' death is one of many tragic outcomes during the fall of Troy, ultimately resulting from the Trojans' ill-fated alliance with Ajax and the Thessalian horse. His story underscores the devastating consequences of this decision and highlights the chaos and suffering experienced by the Trojans as their city fell to the Greeks." />

These actions eventually led to Calchas being forced to reveal prophetic information, although the narrative does not provide further details about this event.&#10;&#10;Priam's thirst for revenge and his reaction to his friend's murder contributed to his downfall by making him a target of Pyrrhus' wrath.

    <node id="1. The event that led to the capture of a Greek spy by the Trojan shepherds is not directly mentioned in the given narrative. However, it can be inferred that the Greek spy, Sinon, was captured after he infiltrated Troy using deceit and treachery, pretending to be a captive brought before King Priam.&#10;   &#10;2. Upon seeing the captive Greek (Sinon), the Trojans are curious and press to see him. They insult the foe while the miscreant stands unarmed and bound, trembling with fear. The Trojans discuss how well the Greeks disguised their wiles, likening Sinon as a nation in a man. Some Trojans show pity for the captive, and they ask him about his origins and news from Greece." />

    <node id="The significant event that occurred on the day in question was the Trojan Horse plot orchestrated by the Greeks. The Greeks, led by Sinon, who had infiltrated Troy through deceit and treachery, opened the horse and released the hidden Greek soldiers. This well-coordinated move allowed the Greeks to surround and attack the Trojans from behind, ultimately leading to the fall of Troy. The Trojans were caught off-guard and suffered heavy losses, as many notable Trojans, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus, met their demise in the ensuing chaos. The Trojan women and children, including Cassandra, were dragged away as captives, marking the end of Troy's reign. This event was made possible by the Greeks' successful concealment of their wiles and the Trojans' unfamiliarity with one another, which contributed to their defeat." />
    <node id="1. The deceitful tactic employed by the Trojan Horse was to present itself as a peace offering, convincing the Trojans that the war had ended and the Greeks had sailed away. This ruse worked because the Trojans desired an end to the conflict, making them more susceptible to believe in this peaceful resolution.&#10;&#10;2. The consequences predicted if Minerva's gift (the wooden horse) was violated or accepted were that Troy would burn in flames if they profaned the statue and brought it into their city, while receiving divine protection and the destruction of Argos and Mycenae if they left it outside their walls. However, these were deceptions meant to manipulate the Trojans into accepting the horse, ultimately leading to their downfall when the Greek soldiers hidden inside the structure opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army." />

    <node id="The Grecians did not actually decide to leave Troy; instead, they were waiting for the right moment to attack. The &quot;stupendous pile&quot; was a giant wooden horse that the Greeks left at the gates of Troy after pretending to sail away. This event is known as the Trojan Horse plot.&#10;&#10;Laocoon, a Trojan priest, warned against bringing the horse into the city, suspecting it was a trick. However, many Trojans wanted to believe in a peaceful resolution to the war and ignored his warnings. The raising of this 'stupendous pile' served as a symbol for both sides: for the Greeks, it represented their cunning deception and victory, while for the Trojans, it signified their gullibility, believing that the horse would bring peace instead of destruction.&#10;&#10;The text also mentions prodigies like meteors and thunders, which were seen as messages from the gods, hinting at Troy's impending doom. When Laocoon was killed by serpents sent by the gods, it further solidified his warnings and made the Trojans more fearful of the horse.&#10;&#10;Taking advantage of these fears, Ulysses and Calchas orchestrated a plan to release Greek soldiers hidden inside the horse once it was brought into Troy. This surprise attack ultimately led to the fall of Troy, as many Trojans, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, Pantheus, and Cassandra, were either killed or taken captive.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Grecians did not leave Troy; they hid within the Trojan Horse and attacked the city when the opportunity arose. The raising of the 'stupendous pile' and accompanying portents played a significant role in this event by creating fear among the Trojans, making them more susceptible to the Greek deception." />
    <node id="Yes, based on the religious beliefs and superstitions of the time, Cassandra could potentially justify betraying the Greeks and revealing state secrets. This is because she believes that the Greek hope for victory relied solely on Minerva's aid, and their fortune turned against them after desecrating her temple. By invoking the powers above, such as Zeus or other deities, Cassandra could argue that it was their divine will for Troy to prevail, given the sacrilegious acts committed by the Greeks.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, she is a royal prophetess who has witnessed the horrific treatment inflicted upon her by the &quot;sacrilegious hands&quot; of the Greeks. By revealing the truth and potentially saving both herself and the king's empire, Cassandra could claim that she was acting in accordance with divine will and fulfilling her duty to protect her people and their kingdom.&#10;&#10;However, it is essential to acknowledge that such actions would still be seen as betrayal by the Greeks, which could lead to severe consequences for Cassandra personally. The morality of her decision would depend on various factors, including the level of desperation she feels in her situation and the extent to which she believes in divine intervention as a justification for her actions." />

He believes that if Heaven had decreed to save unhappy Troy, he would still be alive, and since Troy is falling, he has resolved to die instead of living in exile and old age. Anchises sees his death as a way to remain connected to his homeland, even though this decision goes against the wishes of his son Aeneas, who wants to ensure their safety by insisting on leaving Troy. As the narrative progresses, however, Anchises eventually accepts the reality of the situation and aids Aeneas in leaving Troy with divine assistance." />

    <node id="The Greek hero Odysseus, also known as Ulysses, played a crucial role in the deception involving the Trojan Horse. He and his fellow Greek soldier Calchas hid inside the wooden horse while it was constructed. To convince the Trojans to bring the horse into their city, they used Sinon, another Greek spy who had infiltrated Troy, as a decoy.&#10;&#10;Sinon pretended to be a captive brought before King Priam and claimed that the Greeks had built the wooden horse as an offering to Minerva (Athena) in hopes of appeasing her wrath and ensuring a safe journey home. However, he stated that the Greeks desecrated the statue by throwing a spear at it during the farewell sacrifice, angering Minerva further. Sinon claimed that if the Trojans brought the horse into their city, they would receive divine protection and the destruction of Argos and Mycenae. Conversely, if they profaned the statue and brought it into their city, Troy would burn in flames.&#10;&#10;These were deceptions meant to manipulate the Trojans into accepting the horse, ultimately leading to their downfall when the Greek soldiers hidden inside the structure opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army. The predicted consequences for bringing the wooden horse into the city were based on these false claims and served to further persuade the Trojans that accepting the horse was in their best interest.&#10;&#10;In reality, the consequences were far more devastating for the Trojans, as they led to the fall of Troy and the death or capture of many notable Trojans, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, Pantheus, and Cassandra." />
    <node id="In this text, the speaker is a Trojan who has been marked for sacrifice due to the deceit of the Greeks. After receiving Minerva's gift (the wooden horse), the Trojans were manipulated into accepting it, despite warnings that doing so would bring ruin upon their city.

They hid all night in a weedy lake until they were certain the Greeks had sailed away.&#10;&#10;However, the speaker's future remains uncertain even after escaping the immediate danger of being sacrificed. They express concern about returning to their native soil and seeing their friends again, fearing that the Greeks will take revenge on them and their loved ones. The text leaves the speaker's ultimate fate unresolved, but it highlights the negative consequences of deception, manipulation, and the desire for vengeance." />

    <node id="1. During the Trojan War, Aeneas found himself in a desperate situation when the city of Troy fell to the Greeks after their deceptive strategy with the Wooden Horse. In the chaos and confusion, many Trojans were killed, including some of the notable ones like Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, and Pantheus. The Trojan women and children, including Cassandra, were dragged away by their captors. Amidst this turmoil, Aeneas, who was already wounded, attempted to rescue King Priam from the altar of Zeus where he was defending himself against the Greek warrior Pyrrhus (Neoptolemus). However, Aeneas was unarmed at the time and was eventually carried away by the tide of battle, surviving only through the intervention of the gods." />
    <node id="1. Aeneas instructs his servants to meet him at the ruined temple because it is a landmark that signifies the gathering point for their escape from Troy. The temple of Ceres, once a sacred and important site in the city, has been destroyed in the war, symbolizing the complete ruin of Troy. By choosing this location, Aeneas shows his determination to accept the reality of the situation and move forward with his plan to leave the city.&#10;2. Before carrying his father on his back, Aeneas arms himself for protection by grabbing weapons from the fallen bodies of the Greeks and Trojans around him. This action demonstrates Aeneas' desire to ensure their safety as they make their escape from Troy. He also takes a moment to lament over the body of Creusa, his lost wife, expressing his grief and pain over her death. By doing this, Aeneas shows respect for the dead and honors his loved ones, even in such a tragic situation." />

He also saw the fall of a mighty tree, which could be a symbolic representation of the downfall of the once-mighty and proud city of Troy. This vision further emphasizes the destruction and devastation caused by the ongoing conflict." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Ulysses (Odysseus) was able to escape his sacrificial fate by fleeing before the fatal blow could be struck. He had been condemned to death by Calchas, a seer, who declared that Ulysses was the person fated to die as a sacrifice to ensure the Greeks' safe return from the Trojan War. This decision was made out of fear, after an earlier prophecy stated that the Greek army's passage to Troy had been bought with a virgin's blood and their safe return would require another payment of Grecian blood.&#10;&#10;Ulysses took advantage of the people's fear and ordered Calchas to reveal the identity of the person who was to be sacrificed. After resisting for twice five days, Calchas finally announced Ulysses as the intended victim. However, Ulysses managed to escape his sacrificial fate by hiding in a weedy lake all night and avoiding the priests' attempts to kill him until they eventually gave up and sailed away." />

I hail from a land that has been torn apart by war with Troy, and I was part of the Greek forces seeking to bring an end to this conflict. My captors are now giving me the opportunity to share my story, allowing me to explain who I am and where I come from.&#10;&#10;It is essential to tread carefully in revealing any further information, as my life may depend on how I present myself to the Trojans. While they may show some pity towards me, it is crucial to remember that I remain their captive, and any details I share could be used against me or my fellow Greeks." />
    <node id="The deceptive plan of the Greeks was to build a large wooden horse, which they claimed was a peace offering dedicated to Minerva. The Trojans, desiring an end to the conflict and believing that the war had ended, accepted this gift despite warnings of dire consequences if they profaned the statue by bringing it into their city. Unbeknownst to the Trojans, Greek soldiers were hidden inside the horse. At night, they opened the gates of Troy, allowing the rest of the Greek army to enter and destroy the city.&#10;&#10;This plan demonstrates the idea of &quot;fortune's smile&quot; turning into betrayal because the Greeks initially seemed to be at a disadvantage when they retreated from Troy, appearing to have suffered a defeat. However, this retreat was part of their larger strategy to deceive the Trojans and ultimately achieve victory through treachery. By manipulating the Trojans' desire for peace and their religious beliefs, the Greeks were able to exploit a moment of perceived good fortune (the withdrawal of Greek forces) and turn it into a devastating act of betrayal." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist's desperate search is revealing the grim reality that Troy has fallen into enemy hands, as he encounters hostile Greeks occupying his father's house and a guard of Grecians stationed at Juno's church. These discoveries highlight the extent of the Greek victory and the danger facing the Trojans who remain in the city, further emphasizing the need for Aeneas and Anchises to leave Troy immediately.

    <node id="The passage does not provide direct evidence of someone reluctantly accepting defeat and arranging for their father's transport. However, based on context clues and the information provided in the subsequent lines, it is likely that Aeneas is the character who fits this description. In the given passage, a man (later identified as Sinon) is pleading with the Trojans, trying to win their trust. After his speech, the Trojans begin to converse among themselves, reflecting on Sinon's words and discussing what to do with him. Aeneas then appears in the following lines, expressing reluctance, and makes arrangements to escort his father out of Troy, as he fears for the older man's safety. Therefore, based on contextual evidence, it is reasonable to infer that Aeneas is the character who is reluctantly accepting defeat and arranging for his father's transport." />

    <node id="The narrative does not provide specific information about what happens to the speaker (Aeneas) after the goddess Leucothea leaves him. However, it is clear that Aeneas continues his desperate search for his family and eventually finds himself at Priam's palace. It is here where he encounters the ghost of his wife Creusa, who informs him that she cannot leave the place of her fate and advises him to stop indulging in his pain. So, while the narrative doesn't give explicit details about Aeneas's actions after Leucothea leaves, it can be assumed that he continues to face challenges and make difficult decisions as he navigates the aftermath of Troy's fall." />
    <node id="The passage does not directly provide the information about the radiant mother figure and her message to her son. However, based on common themes in the narrative and the description of Leucothea's departure from Aeneas, it can be inferred that the radiant mother figure is Leucothea, a goddess who appears to help Aeneas during his escape from Troy.&#10;&#10;Leucothea, as a goddess, likely urges Aeneas to remember his responsibilities and reminds him of those he would leave in danger if he continues down a certain path by emphasizing the importance of his mission to found a new city and ensure the survival of his people. She may have also reminded him of her divine assistance and protection during his escape, encouraging him to stay strong and focused on his goals despite the challenges ahead.&#10;&#10;In summary, while not explicitly stated in the passage, the radiant mother figure Leucothea likely urged Aeneas to remember his responsibilities towards his family and people, emphasizing the importance of his mission and the potential dangers for those left behind if he fails in his task." />
    <node id="The situation described in the text is the impending doom of Troy, and Aeneas is the character taking action while expressing reluctance.

Aeneas faces a moral dilemma between respecting his father's wishes and ensuring their safety by insisting on leaving Troy. His decision to leave is influenced by the divine specter's warning about the city's imminent destruction, which highlights the need to protect both Anchises and future generations like Ascanius.&#10;3. Eventually, Anchises accepts the reality of the situation and aids Aeneas in leaving Troy with divine assistance. This turn of events demonstrates that sometimes it takes time for individuals deeply rooted in tradition and homeland to accept change.&#10;4. Throughout his journey, Aeneas hopes to see his friends, native soil, and family again, despite the uncertainties he faces. His ultimate fate remains unresolved in the text, but his story emphasizes the negative consequences of deception, manipulation, and the desire for vengeance." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;strange figure&quot; in the narrative is likely Laocoon, who warned against bringing the wooden horse into Troy. His riddle-like speech emphasized that the Trojans were deceived by the Grecians' ruse because they wanted to believe in a peaceful resolution to the war, ignoring the warnings of danger. This shows how the Grecians took advantage of the Trojans' hopes for an end to the conflict and manipulated their desire for peace to bring about Troy's downfall.&#10;&#10;2. Laocoon's speech is significant because it highlights the power of wishful thinking and the dangers of misplaced trust in deceptive appearances, such as the wooden horse. His warnings were rooted in his fear or prophetic vision, emphasizing the importance of understanding and acknowledging potential threats instead of ignoring them for the sake of hope or convenience.&#10;&#10;3. The Grecians' decision to raise the siege and return home was a result of their successful deception with the wooden horse. By exploiting the Trojans' hopes for peace, they managed to convince their enemies that the war had ended and that they had sailed away. This allowed them to secretly leave soldiers inside the horse and later open the city gates for the rest of the Greek army, ultimately leading to Troy's destruction.&#10;&#10;4. In summary, Laocoon's riddle-like speech was a warning against the deceptive appearance of the wooden horse and the dangers of wishful thinking in the face of potential threats. The Grecians took advantage of the Trojans' hopes for peace to bring about Troy's downfall, showcasing how manipulation and deceit can lead to victory in warfare." />
    <node id="The desperate plea comes from Anchises, the father of Aeneas in the narrative. He is determined to die in Troy due to his deep commitment to their homeland, even when faced with the impending doom of the city. His family, including Aeneas, tries to persuade him to leave and ensure their safety, but Anchises' resolve remains unchanged. This creates a dilemma for Aeneas, who must reconcile his filial duty with the need to protect his father and future generations by escaping from the catastrophe." />

Pantheus is introduced as Apollo's priest who managed to escape the Grecian swords and pass through the flames, indicating that he survived an initial assault on Troy.

He and his fellow Greek soldier Calchas hid inside the wooden horse while it was constructed. To convince the Trojans to bring the horse into their city, they used Sinon, another Greek spy who had infiltrated Troy, as a decoy.&#10;&#10;Sinon pretended to be a captive brought before King Priam and claimed that the Greeks had built the wooden horse as an offering to Minerva (Athena) in hopes of appeasing her wrath and ensuring a safe journey home. However, he stated that the Greeks desecrated the statue by throwing a spear at it during the farewell sacrifice, angering Minerva further. Sinon claimed that if the Trojans brought the horse into their city, they would receive divine protection and the destruction of Argos and Mycenae. Conversely, if they profaned the statue and brought it into their city, Troy would burn in flames.&#10;&#10;These were deceptions meant to manipulate the Trojans into accepting the horse, ultimately leading to their downfall when the Greek soldiers hidden inside the structure opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army. The predicted consequences for bringing the wooden horse into the city were based on these false claims and served to further persuade the Trojans that accepting the horse was in their best interest.&#10;&#10;In reality, the consequences were far more devastating for the Trojans, as they led to the fall of Troy and the death or capture of many notable Trojans, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, Pantheus, and Cassandra.">

The &quot;stupendous pile&quot; was a giant wooden horse that the Greeks left at the gates of Troy after pretending to sail away. This event is known as the Trojan Horse plot.&#10;&#10;Laocoon, a Trojan priest, warned against bringing the horse into the city, suspecting it was a trick. However, many Trojans wanted to believe in a peaceful resolution to the war and ignored his warnings. The raising of this 'stupendous pile' served as a symbol for both sides: for the Greeks, it represented their cunning deception and victory, while for the Trojans, it signified their gullibility, believing that the horse would bring peace instead of destruction.&#10;&#10;The text also mentions prodigies like meteors and thunders, which were seen as messages from the gods, hinting at Troy's impending doom. When Laocoon was killed by serpents sent by the gods, it further solidified his warnings and made the Trojans more fearful of the horse.&#10;&#10;Taking advantage of these fears, Ulysses and Calchas orchestrated a plan to release Greek soldiers hidden inside the horse once it was brought into Troy. This surprise attack ultimately led to the fall of Troy, as many Trojans, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, Pantheus, and Cassandra, were either killed or taken captive.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Grecians did not leave Troy; they hid within the Trojan Horse and attacked the city when the opportunity arose. The raising of the 'stupendous pile' and accompanying portents played a significant role in this event by creating fear among the Trojans, making them more susceptible to the Greek deception.">

These actions eventually led to Calchas being forced to reveal prophetic information, although the narrative does not provide further details about this event.&#10;&#10;Priam's thirst for revenge and his reaction to his friend's murder contributed to his downfall by making him a target of Pyrrhus' wrath. The speaker ultimately regrets focusing on his personal desire for vengeance, as it only led to more pain and suffering.">

However, many Trojans wanted to believe in a peaceful resolution to the war and ignored his warnings.

When Laocoon was killed by serpents sent by the gods, it further solidified his warnings and made the Trojans more fearful of the horse.&#10;&#10;Taking advantage of these fears, Ulysses and Calchas orchestrated a plan to release Greek soldiers hidden inside the horse once it was brought into Troy. This surprise attack ultimately led to the fall of Troy, as many Trojans, including Coroebus, Ripheus, Dymas, Hypanis, Pantheus, and Cassandra, were either killed or taken captive.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Grecians did not leave Troy; they hid within the Trojan Horse and attacked the city when the opportunity arose. The raising of the 'stupendous pile' and accompanying portents played a significant role in this event by creating fear among the Trojans, making them more susceptible to the Greek deception.">

This decision was made out of fear, after an earlier prophecy stated that the Greek army's passage to Troy had been bought with a virgin's blood and their safe return would require another payment of Grecian blood.&#10;&#10;Ulysses took advantage of the people's fear and ordered Calchas to reveal the identity of the person who was to be sacrificed.

Eventually, Polites was transfixed by one of Pyrrhus' thrusts and died, with his father, Priam, witnessing the tragic event.&#10;&#10;Deeply affected by his son's murder, Priam expressed his anger towards Pyrrhus and called upon the gods to avenge this brutal act.

    <node id="1. The multiple choice questions in the booklet that Don received could be used for a psychological test to assess an individual's attitudes, values, and beliefs. It is not necessarily intended to extract scientific secrets from Don, but rather to understand his perspectives and thought processes.&#10;2. Betty's suggestion that they could be a spy ring or subversive agents trying to find out Don's scientific secrets is not entirely off the mark. However, as Don rightly points out, there is nothing in the questionnaire that seems to explicitly target his work or research.&#10;3. The questions in the booklet appear to be more focused on measuring Don's attitudes and values, such as his views on secrecy, responsibility, and social impact. This is evident in questions like &quot;If you had discovered a new and virulent poison...&quot; or &quot;Why do you want information about POSAT?&quot;&#10;4. The organization that sent the questionnaire to Don, referred to as POSAT, claims to be an ancient secret society aimed at helping lost individuals find their direction in life. They use some of their newly won knowledge to rehabilitate people and even find jobs or repair homes for them. Thus, the multiple choice questions could be used to assess Don's suitability for membership or his alignment with the organization's values and goals." />

It looks like a psychological test of some sort.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,&quot; worried Don. &quot;Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered a new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common household ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a daily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent exterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use as a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too dangerous to be passed on?'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Could they be a spy ring?&quot; asked Betty. &quot;Subversive agents? Anxious to find out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're so careful of when you bring it home from the lab?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don scanned the papers quickly. &quot;There's nothing here that looks like an attempt to get information." />

It also served to increase his curiosity.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you suppose they're driving at?&quot; he asked his wife Betty, handing her the booklet and questionnaire.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't really know what to say,&quot; she answered, squinting a little as she usually did when puzzled. &quot;I know one thing, though, and that's that you won't stop until you find out!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The scientific attitude,&quot; he acknowledged with a grin.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?&quot; she suggested. &quot;Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our money. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don was shocked. &quot;If I send this back to them, it will have to be with correct answers!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The scientific attitude again,&quot; Betty sighed. &quot;Don't you ever let your imagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give for your reasons for asking about POSAT?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Curiosity,&quot; he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest pocket, he wrote exactly" />
    <node id=" when you bring it home from the lab?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don scanned the papers quickly. &quot;There's nothing here that looks like an attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about my work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know what company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures attitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be—a secret society—and that they actually screen their applicants?&quot;&#10; &#10; He smiled wryly. &quot;Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade after starting out to expose their racket?&quot;&#10; &#10; He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the dilemmas before him.&#10; &#10; His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and, paradoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.&#10; &#10; Dear Doctor Alford:&#10; &#10; We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to us.

He also designed the atomic reactor we use for power here in the laboratory.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then the pictures are modern,&quot; said Don, aware that his mouth was hanging open foolishly. &quot;I thought one was a Titian—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is,&quot; said Crandon. &quot;We have several original Titians, although I really don't know too much about them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But how could a man alive today buy paintings from an artist of the Renaissance?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements claim—an ancient secret society. Our founder has been dead for over four centuries.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years, however.&quot;&#10; &#10; Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. &quot;Let's start at the beginning,&quot; he said, and Don was back again in the classroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the pages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. &quot;Four hundred years ago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived" />
    <node id=" POSAT as a last resort—lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we put into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate them—anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's good practice for us.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't answered mine. Will you join us?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him. He had one more question.&#10; &#10; &quot;Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the stubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?&quot;&#10; &#10; Crandon smiled. &quot;You're here, aren't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.&#10; &#10; &quot;Enroll me as a member,&quot; he said." />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Hello, Don,&quot; said a quiet voice beside him. &quot;It's good to see you again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Dr. Crandon!&quot; he heard his own voice reply. &quot; You're the Grand Chairman of POSAT?&quot;&#10; &#10; He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which Crandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and his own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure of scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous place—didn't anything make sense any longer?&#10; &#10; &quot;I think we have rather abused you, Don,&quot; Dr. Crandon continued. His voice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any evil in it. &quot;I can see that you are suspicious of us, and—yes—afraid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm his identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.&#10; &#10; Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. &quot;You're partly right about us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization has broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself before the" />
    <node id="1. Don Alford would need to take a day off from work and travel almost a hundred miles to attend the personal interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT. He has to inform his department office about his absence.&#10;2. If he declines the invitation, he may miss an opportunity to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses, but it might also save him from getting involved in any potential illegal activities of the organization. By accepting the invitation, Don risks his reputation and career if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful. However, declining the invitation may also raise suspicions about his intentions or invite further scrutiny." />
    <node id=" inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the requirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable secret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.&#10; &#10; Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand Chairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this arrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make another appointment for you.&#10; &#10; The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one for Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the laboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his research problems home with him and worried over them half the night, they were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for pursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was in a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a whole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?&#10; &#10; It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be disappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been sent" />
    <node id="Why do you hide behind such a weird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just anyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work for me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why haven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work on this project—before it's too late?&quot;&#10; &#10; Crandon took a sighing breath. &quot;How I wish that we could do just that! But you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is to maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely disclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this building will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached the wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if they attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were invited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we know more about how you will react in any given situation than you do yourself.

    <node id=" looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that particular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own, POSAT had unearthed the information.&#10; &#10; His wife's words echoed in his mind, &quot;Could they be a spy ring? Subversive agents?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His conservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too melodramatic.&#10; &#10; At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he knew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.&#10; &#10; He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not be at work on Tuesday.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters. It seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall was occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete construction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the street in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings of a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and was also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.&#10; &#10; It was" />
    <node id=" to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the other side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind alley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence in them.&#10; &#10; Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not only several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that one of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it contained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and black enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an active member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month; please remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled contentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.&#10; &#10; After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy it, too.&#10; &#10; Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown contents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded sheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with sharp surprise.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Come here a minute, Betty,&quot; he called, spreading them out carefully on the dining room table." />
    <node id="1. Curiosity led Bill Evans to find disappointment and then hope, despite not being able to see the contents of the envelopes from POSAT. He was initially disappointed when the pamphlet he received from POSAT offered no help for his unemployment situation and gave vague answers to life's problems. However, his curiosity paid off when he unexpectedly found a job in a wholesale pharmacy located next to the same warehouse as the offices of POSAT.&#10;2. Bill Evans found this job through a seemingly coincidental opportunity. He did not mention any specific details about looking for a job, yet POSAT's response included information about an opening at a wholesale pharmacy on the other side of the warehouse where their offices are located. This allowed Bill to find employment, which eased his financial worries and provided him with hope for the future." />
    <node id=" your reasons for asking about POSAT?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Curiosity,&quot; he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest pocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.&#10; &#10; It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the contents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of POSAT the following week. For this time they differed.&#10; &#10; Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed gave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They were couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no help to him.&#10; &#10; His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he had unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap. When he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a position had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older industrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place to work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was hope for the future.&#10; &#10; It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the other side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind alley indeed! He" />

Since he was a methodical man, it was entrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his other letters.&#10; &#10; Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in response to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information than had the original advertisement, but with considerable more volubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the key that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself—if he would merely fill out the enclosed form.&#10; &#10; Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for several days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had mentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he had watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were almost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by something supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.&#10; &#10; He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay heavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested information—about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his reason for inquiring about POSAT," />

Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT ad with the disregard accorded to any common object.&#10; &#10; He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that some component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his brain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that couldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.&#10; &#10; It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his attention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small black circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr atom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the printed matter that accompanied it.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wonder what their racket is,&quot; he mused. Then, because his typewriter was conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted it in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted lines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it. He addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and promptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was entrusted to the U.S. mail" />

However, it is worth noting that POSAT has been able to successfully recruit Don Alford, who initially had reservations about the organization. Additionally, POSAT claims to have helped other lost individuals find their direction in life by rehabilitating them and providing anonymous assistance. Therefore, it is possible that POSAT's methods could be effective for certain individuals, but more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion." />

Desperate people: For those who view POSAT as a last resort in their search for purpose, the organization puts into practice some of its newly won knowledge to rehabilitate them anonymously. They help these individuals find jobs or repair their homes, which not only benefits the individuals but also provides good practice for POSAT members. This strategy allows POSAT to make a positive impact on people's lives while avoiding any potential issues that could arise from involvement with unsuitable candidates." />

Without quite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some of his desperation and sense of futility.&#10; &#10; Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the information that she wished to give—all about her poor, dear father who had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt toward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were reincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a religion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete and absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their booklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately. Fortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial situation.&#10; &#10; To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that POSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in his employment or financial position? It also served to increase his curiosity.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you" />
    <node id="1. POSAT is an ancient secret society that claims to have been founded over four centuries ago during the Italian Renaissance by a super-genius individual with an incredible mentality that appears only once in thousands of years. This founder was a physical scientist and mathematician who invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, electromagnetic radiation, and Maxwell's equations, and formulated the special and general theories of relativity centuries before they were officially discovered by modern scientists.&#10;2. The reason POSAT's founder could buy original paintings from artists like Titian who lived during the Renaissance era is that the organization claims to have broken many laws but not immoral ones. They consider themselves one of the most moral organizations in the world. POSAT's founder had amassed a personal collection of art, which he bought directly from the artists themselves, and donated some of these works to the organization's waiting room. The founder has been dead for over four centuries, but his legacy lives on through POSAT's secret discoveries and achievements." />
    <node id=", of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization has broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself before the day is over.&quot;&#10; &#10; Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you use?&quot; he asked bitterly. &quot;Drugs? Hypnosis?&quot;&#10; &#10; Crandon sighed. &quot;I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long story to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to trust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of what POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the most moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have stumbled into a den of thieves.&quot;&#10; &#10; Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.&#10; &#10; &quot;Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?&quot;&#10; &#10; Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.&#10; &#10; &quot;They were donated by the founder of our Organization.

    <node id=" of Professor Crandon unfolding the pages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. &quot;Four hundred years ago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a super-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not in every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of years.&#10; &#10; &quot;Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was one like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia, and his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course of man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand years has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the civilizations to which it has been passed on directly.&#10; &#10; &quot;The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was a physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager heritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling physical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his principal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what we call Maxwell's equations—although, of course, he antedated Maxwell by centuries—developed the special and general" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, it is not explicitly stated what happens immediately after Don Alford hands over the letter to the &quot;ordinary-looking girl&quot; at the POSAT office. However, we know that he is then led into a different room and is given some papers to fill out. These papers contain dilemmas that he must resolve. It is also mentioned that Don Alford has been expecting a personal invitation to meet with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, so it's possible that this meeting may be arranged after he completes the paperwork.&#10;&#10;However, there are some potential outcomes that can be inferred based on the story and the supporting materials:&#10;&#10;* Don Alford has been invited to a personal interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, which would require him to take a day off from work and travel almost a hundred miles. This meeting could potentially lead to an opportunity for Don to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses.&#10;* If Don declines the invitation, he may miss out on this opportunity and avoid any potential involvement in illegal activities of the organization. However, declining the invitation could also raise suspicions about his intentions or invite further scrutiny.&#10;* By accepting the invitation, Don risks his reputation and career if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story suggests that Don Alford is in a difficult position and must weigh the potential benefits and risks of accepting or declining the invitation to meet with the Grand Chairman of POSAT." />
    <node id=" pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and was also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.&#10; &#10; It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door marked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.&#10; &#10; He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced a dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him a buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way up through the murky stairwell.&#10; &#10; The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk facing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the pattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of the summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom somewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here that he had come to expect.&#10; &#10; The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary. Not the Mata-Hari type , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own suspicions. He handed her the letter.&#10; &#10; She smiled. &quot;We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step into the next" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Don Alford's visit to the location indicated by the POSAT emblem is to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT. He has been led to believe that this meeting could potentially lead to an opportunity for him to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses. However, Don also recognizes the potential risks of accepting the invitation, as it could put his reputation and career at risk if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful.&#10;2. Based on Don's initial observations, the setting for his appointment with POSAT is a large, sprawling warehouse that appears to be almost entirely windowless. The building is recessed from the street in several places and is surrounded by smaller, shabbier buildings such as a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, and an upholstering shop. This suggests that POSAT's headquarters may be located in an unassuming or unexpected location, possibly to maintain a low profile.&#10;3. The people Don encounters upon his arrival are not described in great detail, but it is mentioned that he is greeted by an &quot;ordinary-looking girl&quot; who works for POSAT. This description suggests that the organization may employ individuals from diverse backgrounds or appearances, and that first impressions may not always be accurate.&#10;4. Overall, Don's visit to POSAT headquarters appears to be motivated by a desire for new scientific knowledge or discovery, as well as a sense of curiosity about the organization's true intentions. While he recognizes the potential risks involved in accepting the invitation, he also seems eager to learn more and keep an open mind. The setting for his visit is described as unassuming and low-profile, which may suggest that POSAT values discretion or secrecy in its operations." />
    <node id="1. The fact that Don is shocked and overwhelmed by the sight of the laboratory below him suggests that it represents a significant advancement in scientific knowledge and technology. This could indicate that POSAT has access to resources and discoveries that are not available to the general public, making it an attractive prospect for Don, who is eager to learn new scientific knowledge.&#10;2. However, Don's reaction may also reflect a sense of unease or discomfort at the idea of being involved in any potential illegal or unethical activities associated with POSAT's research. This could be related to his earlier hesitation about accepting the invitation, as he is aware of the risks involved in becoming affiliated with the organization.&#10;3. Overall, Don's reaction to the laboratory suggests that it represents a significant turning point in his interaction with POSAT, forcing him to confront the reality of what the organization stands for and the potential consequences of becoming a member." />
    <node id=" Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was distressingly ominous.&#10; &#10; &quot;Our Grand Chairman will see you now,&quot; she said in a quiet voice.&#10; &#10; Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal expecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage to find.&#10; &#10; She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he supposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.&#10; &#10; Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room, which must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted outside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where a frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of the room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of which he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar to him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had ever used, and there was something about it that convinced him that this was more advanced.

    <node id="based on the story, the glowing fluorescent light tube that Don examines does not require wires or an external power source to operate. Instead, it appears to be a self-contained lighting unit that converts radioactivity into light, with the heat generated by this process being dissipated efficiently enough that the tube remains cool to the touch. This technology is beyond what Don's company has been able to develop in their experimental models, which still require shielding and have not been successful at converting all of the radioactivity into light. It is unclear from the story how POSAT has managed to produce such a device, but it seems that they have done so in secret, as Don is surprised and skeptical when he encounters one in their gallery." />

It was hung at eye level—that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend over a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently there was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those days? He wished he knew more about such things.&#10; &#10; Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube held on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his scrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the light. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a muffled thud.&#10;  Now I've done it! thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube hadn't shattered.&#10; &#10; In fact—it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact, even while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the brackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support the tube.&#10; &#10; There were no wires!&#10; &#10; Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between trembling fingers." />

Although it was delivering as much light as a two or three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it minutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.&#10; &#10; The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never seen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held one in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as experimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the radioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.&#10; &#10; Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still be searching for the right combination of fluorescent material and radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient, self-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this moment!&#10;  But this is impossible! he thought. We're the only company that's working on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual production!&#10; &#10; &#10; And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it have fallen into the possession of POS" />

For a moment Don had difficulty breathing. The rug—Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum. The paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were surely old masters—of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he recognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the artists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian. Or was it Tintorretto?

    <node id="yes, that is the claim of Mr. Crandon. He argues that their slow progress in discoveries and inventions is mainly due to their own stupidity, as they are not giving enough credit to the sequence of discoveries leading up to it. According to him, four hundred years ago, there lived a super-genius who had an incredible mentality that appears only once in thousands of years. This man was a physical scientist and mathematician who started with the meager heritage that existed in these fields in his time and began tackling physical puzzles one by one. He invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation, and what we call Maxwell's equations, developed the special and general theories of relativity, the tool of wave mechanics, and finally, derived the packing fraction that describes the binding energy of nuclei. He also built an atomic reactor like the one in use for only twenty years, and he had the knowledge to build an atomic bomb, which was used by others after his death." />

Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a little early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But by one man,&quot; Don argued.&#10; &#10; Crandon shrugged. &quot;Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men. So are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had come, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know that inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based on the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of simultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only our own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.&#10; &#10; &quot;He merely followed the straight path,&quot; Crandon finished simply.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm of possibility.&#10; &#10; But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread before him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Four hundred years!&quot; he murmured with awe. &quot;You've had four hundred years head-start on the rest of the world!

You've undoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a fairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are other things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until you have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as they contribute to our central project.

    <node id="Based on the story provided, after Don Alford hands over the letter to the &quot;ordinary-looking girl&quot; at the POSAT office, he is led into a different room. The luxurious room that Dr. Alford steps into has decorations and paintings that are striking in their contrast to the shabby reception room. He sees an expensive rug, which reminds him of one he had seen before in a museum. The paintings on the walls have ornate frames with gilt carving and appear to be old masters from the Renaissance period, possibly by artists such as Titian or Tintorretto.&#10;&#10;Don Alford regrets having passed up Art History in college in favor of Operational Circuit Analysis, as he feels that he could almost name the artists responsible for the paintings on display. This shows that Don Alford has an appreciation for art and culture, and it is a missed opportunity for him to have not pursued this interest further during his college years. Overall, the luxurious room represents a stark contrast to the shabby reception area and serves to highlight the wealth and sophistication of POSAT, despite its unassuming exterior appearance." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it is not explicitly stated that Leonardo da Vinci, who is implied to be the super-genius founder of the secret society, theoretically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding energy of nuclei. However, the story does suggest that he had made many significant scientific and mathematical discoveries, including developing the special and general theories of relativity, and building an atomic reactor. It is also mentioned that he foresaw the destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. Therefore, while it is not explicitly stated, it is possible that Leonardo da Vinci had theoretically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding energy of nuclei.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that the idea of Leonardo da Vinci having knowledge of nuclear physics and building an atomic reactor is highly unlikely and not supported by historical evidence. The story presents this as a fantastic and fictional scenario." />

    <node id="Bill Evans' curiosity about POSAT led him to fill out a form from the organization, despite his initial disappointment and skepticism. This was partly due to his financial desperation and lack of alternatives, as well as his hope that there might be something more to POSAT's offer than what initially met the eye. Coincidentally, he received a job opportunity at a wholesale pharmacy located next to the same warehouse as POSAT's offices, which may have made him more open to exploring possible connections with the organization.&#10;&#10;However, the envelopes he received from POSAT contained a pamphlet that gave vague answers to life's problems and offered no help for his unemployment situation. Despite this second disappointment, Bill found hope in his new job, which provided him with financial security and eased his worries about the future. The location of POSAT's offices next to his workplace became an amusing footnote to his initial curiosity about the organization.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bill Evans' curiosity about POSAT did not yield any tangible benefits related to his employment situation or personal problems. However, it indirectly led him to find a job that improved his financial situation and gave him hope for the future." />
    <node id="1. Don Alford has trouble locating the POSAT headquarters because it appears to be a large, sprawling warehouse that is almost entirely windowless and recessed from the street. The building is surrounded by smaller, shabbier buildings such as a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, and an upholstering shop, which may make it difficult to identify. Don may have been expecting POSAT's headquarters to be in a more conventional or prominent location, so the unassuming appearance of the building makes him question whether he is in the correct location. This could also suggest that POSAT values discretion or secrecy in its operations and chooses to operate from an unexpected or low-profile location." />
    <node id="1. The true purpose and nature of POSAT is that it is an ancient secret society, founded over four centuries ago during the Italian Renaissance by a super-genius individual who made significant contributions to physics, mathematics, and art. They maintain secrecy to protect their discoveries until they can be safely disclosed, only approaching potential members who they believe will join the organization and keep its secrets.&#10;2. POSAT uses questionnaires and psychological tests to assess an individual's attitudes, values, and beliefs before inviting them to join. They recruit members through advertisements in magazines with the aim of helping lost individuals find their direction in life by providing anonymous assistance and rehabilitation.&#10;3. While POSAT has a moral stance and does not break immoral laws, they have broken some laws in order to amass a personal collection of art from artists like Titian during the Renaissance era. These works are donated to the organization's waiting room for members to appreciate.&#10;4. The reason for their secrecy is that if they approached the wrong scientist or individual, centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if they attempted to reveal or exploit POSAT's secrets. By maintaining secrecy and carefully selecting members, POSAT can ensure that their discoveries are protected until they are ready to be disclosed safely." />
    <node id="1. The true purpose of POSAT, as revealed to Don, is to work against time to save civilization by studying the newest science of human motivation. They have been developing this knowledge for two centuries and are now ready to put some of it into practice. POSAT's enigmatic methods, such as advertising in magazines and inviting just anyone to join, are likely aimed at finding individuals who align with their goals and values or who can contribute to their research.&#10;2. Don has been chosen by POSAT because they see potential in him as a valuable member of their organization. His skepticism and questioning nature, evident during his encounter with Crandon and the fluorescent light tube, may indicate an ability to critically evaluate and contribute to POSAT's research on human motivation. Furthermore, Don's eagerness to learn new scientific knowledge and his career as a scientist make him an attractive candidate for involvement in POSAT's efforts to save civilization.&#10;3. By involving Don, POSAT may gain access to his expertise, perspective, and resources, allowing them to further their research and achieve their goals more effectively. Additionally, Don's enrollment as a member could potentially lead to the involvement of other like-minded individuals in POSAT's efforts, creating a network of scientists and experts dedicated to understanding and influencing human motivation for the betterment of society." />

Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Come with me,&quot; said Crandon.&#10; &#10; He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a steep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw what must have been the world's largest computing machine.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is our answer,&quot; said Crandon. &quot;Oh, rather, it's the tool by which we find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the newest of the sciences—that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready to put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one respect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to save our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to do. Will you join us, Don?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why the hocus-pocus?&quot; asked Don. &quot;Why do you hide behind such a weird front as POSAT?

    <node id="1. The arrangements necessary for Don Alford's personal interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT include taking a day off from work and traveling almost a hundred miles to the headquarters of POSAT in a town distant from his residence. He also needs to fill out some papers after he arrives at the POSAT office.&#10;2. Don is considering not attending the appointment because he may miss an opportunity to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses if he declines the invitation. However, by accepting the invitation, he risks his reputation and career if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful. Additionally, taking a day off from work to attend the meeting may not be convenient for him, and he may also have concerns about POSAT's activities based on some information he received." />
    <node id="1. Don is examining an atomic reactor in astonishment. This realization comes to him when he sees the familiar shape of an atomic reactor through the bluish-green plastic shielding.&#10;2. The person who greets him as &quot;Dr. Crandon&quot; is none other than Dr. Crandon himself, the Grand Chairman of POSAT. He appears on the balcony and greets Don in a quiet voice after noticing Don's surprise." />
    <node id="1. The story does not provide a specific answer to how POSAT obtained Don Alford's laboratory address, only that it was sent to his workplace instead of his home and that he had not given that particular bit of information to them. It is possible that they looked up his address through a directory of the Institute of Physics or the alumni directory of the university as Don himself speculates. However, the story suggests that Don finds this more sinister, implying that there may be more mysterious or unsettling reasons for how POSAT obtained his address." />
    <node id="ps?&#10; &#10; It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be disappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her about it without telephoning.&#10;  Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home! But it was impossible!&#10; &#10; He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the envelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him, unmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number of the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given them!&#10; &#10; &quot;Get hold of yourself,&quot; he commanded his frightened mind. &quot;There's some perfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the directory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of the university. Or—or—&quot;&#10; &#10; But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His laboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble of looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that particular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own, POSAT had unearthed" />
    <node id="If Crandon's claim is true, then his society would have had a significant head start in terms of technological development, particularly in the physical sciences. According to Crandon, their founder was a super-genius who discovered calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, electromagnetic radiation, and what we call Maxwell’s equations, among other major scientific breakthroughs. He even built an atomic reactor and had the knowledge to build an atomic bomb.&#10;&#10;Given this 400-year head start, Crandon claims that they have made many technological advancements beyond what is familiar to the rest of the world. They have developed a shielding material for their reactors, which is a fairly recent development in metallurgy. Additionally, they have other advanced technologies in their laboratory that Don cannot understand due to a lack of technical background.&#10;&#10;However, Crandon also mentions that their emphasis has not been solely on physical sciences, but rather on using this knowledge to change civilization and prevent disasters from occurring. Unfortunately, despite their efforts and centuries of advance warning, the rest of the world has still developed atomic weapons, demonstrating that they have failed in their mission to prevent disaster." />
    <node id="1. Dr. Crandon is the Grand Chairman of POSAT, an organization that has been working for two centuries to study and develop knowledge in the newest science of human motivation. They have used unconventional methods, such as advertising in magazines and inviting anyone to join, to find suitable individuals who can contribute to their research or benefit from their rehabilitation efforts.&#10;2. Dr. Crandon acknowledges that POSAT has abused Don by not being entirely truthful about their purpose and his involvement. He admits that the organization has broken many laws but asks Don not to condemn them yet, expressing hope that Don will become a member. Crandon's gentle demeanor and persuasive tone aim to alleviate Don's suspicions and fears while emphasizing the potential benefits of joining POSAT in their mission to save civilization.&#10;3. Dr. Crandon sees value in Don's skepticism, questioning nature, scientific expertise, and eagerness to learn, making him an attractive candidate for membership. By involving Don, POSAT could gain access to his resources and connections, potentially leading to the enrollment of other like-minded individuals who can contribute to their research and goals." />
    <node id="1. Don's curiosity about the questionnaire he received stems from the fact that it was sent by an organization called POSAT, which claims to be a secret society aiming to help lost individuals find their direction in life. He is intrigued by the idea of a psychological test that measures attitudes and values, as well as whether POSAT is genuinely screening applicants for membership.&#10;2. Betty suggests they approach completing the questionnaire incognito by pretending to be wealthy and seeing if POSAT tries to get their money. This serves to increase Don's curiosity, but he feels obligated to answer the questions truthfully as it seems to be an official psychological test." />
    <node id="In the story, Don is witnessing a secret underground laboratory and warehouse belonging to POSAT, an ancient secret society. He sees advanced scientific equipment, including what he recognizes as an atomic reactor enclosed in bluish-green plastic shielding. The person who addressed him at the end of the balcony is none other than Dr. Crandon himself, the Grand Chairman of POSAT, whom Don had previously known as his professor in college.&#10;&#10;Dr. Crandon greets Don and explains that they have abused him by bringing him to their facility without his consent. Despite the initial shock and suspicion he feels towards POSAT, Don cannot help but be impressed by the advanced technology he sees around him, including a glowing fluorescent light tube that converts radioactivity into light without requiring wires or an external power source.&#10;&#10;The revelation that Dr. Crandon is the Grand Chairman of POSAT and that the organization possesses advanced technology beyond what Don's company has been able to develop in their experimental models takes him by surprise. The fact that POSAT has managed to produce such a device in secret, along with the realization that he may not be allowed to leave the facility alive, leaves Don feeling betrayed, scared, and overwhelmed." />
    <node id="1. Financial desperation and lack of alternatives: Bill Evans was in a dire financial situation and had no better options for employment, which led him to fill out the form from POSAT despite his skepticism and initial disappointment.&#10;2. Curiosity: Despite his doubts, Bill's curiosity got the better of him, and he hoped that there might be something more to POSAT's offer than what initially met the eye.&#10;3. Unexpected job opportunity: After receiving the form from POSAT, Bill unexpectedly found a job at a wholesale pharmacy located next to the same warehouse as POSAT's offices. This newfound employment opportunity may have made him more open to exploring possible connections with POSAT.&#10;4. Disappointment with contents of envelopes: The envelopes from POSAT contained a pamphlet that gave vague answers to life's problems and offered no help for his unemployment situation. However, this disappointment did not affect his new job opportunity.&#10;5. Improved financial situation: Bill's curiosity about POSAT indirectly led him to find employment that improved his financial situation and gave him hope for the future, regardless of the lack of tangible benefits related to his employment situation or personal problems from POSAT." />
    <node id="1. The paintings in the waiting room are original works from famous artists like Titian, which were part of the founder's personal collection. He bought these paintings directly from the artists themselves during the Renaissance era. These paintings serve as a reminder of the founder's appreciation for art and his connections to famous artists of that time.&#10;2. The atomic reactor mentioned in the story is also related to the founder, as he designed it for powering the POSAT laboratory. This highlights the founder's genius and innovation in various fields, including science and mathematics, which led to the development of advanced technologies like an atomic reactor. By using this reactor for power, POSAT demonstrates its commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technology while maintaining secrecy about its discoveries.&#10;3. Overall, the paintings and the atomic reactor serve as symbols of the founder's multidisciplinary achievements in art, science, and mathematics. The waiting room paintings showcase his appreciation for art, while the atomic reactor represents his scientific accomplishments. Both elements emphasize the unique character and legacy of POSAT's founder, contributing to the organization's mystique and allure." />
    <node id="1. Don Alford is contemplating whether to accept or decline the invitation to meet with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, considering the inconvenient time and location of the appointment and its potential impact on his work and Betty's expectations. If he accepts the invitation, he would need to take a day off from work and travel almost a hundred miles, which may not be convenient for him and could raise suspicions about his intentions or invite further scrutiny if he declines. By declining the invitation, Don risks missing an opportunity to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses. However, he also avoids any potential involvement in illegal activities of the organization and protects his reputation and career if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful. Ultimately, Don must weigh the benefits and risks of accepting or declining the invitation to make an informed decision." />
    <edge source="1. The multiple choice questions in the booklet that Don received could be used for a psychological test to assess an individual's attitudes, values, and beliefs. It is not necessarily intended to extract scientific secrets from Don, but rather to understand his perspectives and thought processes.&#10;2. Betty's suggestion that they could be a spy ring or subversive agents trying to find out Don's scientific secrets is not entirely off the mark. However, as Don rightly points out, there is nothing in the questionnaire that seems to explicitly target his work or research.&#10;3. The questions in the booklet appear to be more focused on measuring Don's attitudes and values, such as his views on secrecy, responsibility, and social impact. This is evident in questions like &quot;If you had discovered a new and virulent poison...&quot; or &quot;Why do you want information about POSAT?&quot;&#10;4. The organization that sent the questionnaire to Don, referred to as POSAT, claims to be an ancient secret society aimed at helping lost individuals find their direction in life. They use some of their newly won knowledge to rehabilitate people and even find jobs or repair homes for them.

The purpose of Don Alford's visit to the location indicated by the POSAT emblem is to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT. He has been led to believe that this meeting could potentially lead to an opportunity for him to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses. However, Don also recognizes the potential risks of accepting the invitation, as it could put his reputation and career at risk if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful.&#10;2. Based on Don's initial observations, the setting for his appointment with POSAT is a large, sprawling warehouse that appears to be almost entirely windowless. The building is recessed from the street in several places and is surrounded by smaller, shabbier buildings such as a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, and an upholstering shop. This suggests that POSAT's headquarters may be located in an unassuming or unexpected location, possibly to maintain a low profile.&#10;3. The people Don encounters upon his arrival are not described in great detail, but it is mentioned that he is greeted by an &quot;ordinary-looking girl&quot; who works for POSAT. This description suggests that the organization may employ individuals from diverse backgrounds or appearances, and that first impressions may not always be accurate.&#10;4. Overall, Don's visit to POSAT headquarters appears to be motivated by a desire for new scientific knowledge or discovery, as well as a sense of curiosity about the organization's true intentions. While he recognizes the potential risks involved in accepting the invitation, he also seems eager to learn more and keep an open mind. The setting for his visit is described as unassuming and low-profile, which may suggest that POSAT values discretion or secrecy in its operations.">

The true purpose and nature of POSAT is that it is an ancient secret society, founded over four centuries ago during the Italian Renaissance by a super-genius individual who made significant contributions to physics, mathematics, and art. They maintain secrecy to protect their discoveries until they can be safely disclosed, only approaching potential members who they believe will join the organization and keep its secrets.&#10;2. POSAT uses questionnaires and psychological tests to assess an individual's attitudes, values, and beliefs before inviting them to join. They recruit members through advertisements in magazines with the aim of helping lost individuals find their direction in life by providing anonymous assistance and rehabilitation.&#10;3. While POSAT has a moral stance and does not break immoral laws, they have broken some laws in order to amass a personal collection of art from artists like Titian during the Renaissance era. These works are donated to the organization's waiting room for members to appreciate.&#10;4. The reason for their secrecy is that if they approached the wrong scientist or individual, centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if they attempted to reveal or exploit POSAT's secrets. By maintaining secrecy and carefully selecting members, POSAT can ensure that their discoveries are protected until they are ready to be disclosed safely.">

The true purpose of POSAT, as revealed to Don, is to work against time to save civilization by studying the newest science of human motivation. They have been developing this knowledge for two centuries and are now ready to put some of it into practice. POSAT's enigmatic methods, such as advertising in magazines and inviting just anyone to join, are likely aimed at finding individuals who align with their goals and values or who can contribute to their research.&#10;2. Don has been chosen by POSAT because they see potential in him as a valuable member of their organization. His skepticism and questioning nature, evident during his encounter with Crandon and the fluorescent light tube, may indicate an ability to critically evaluate and contribute to POSAT's research on human motivation. Furthermore, Don's eagerness to learn new scientific knowledge and his career as a scientist make him an attractive candidate for involvement in POSAT's efforts to save civilization.&#10;3. By involving Don, POSAT may gain access to his expertise, perspective, and resources, allowing them to further their research and achieve their goals more effectively. Additionally, Don's enrollment as a member could potentially lead to the involvement of other like-minded individuals in POSAT's efforts, creating a network of scientists and experts dedicated to understanding and influencing human motivation for the betterment of society.">

POSAT is an ancient secret society that claims to have been founded over four centuries ago during the Italian Renaissance by a super-genius individual with an incredible mentality that appears only once in thousands of years. This founder was a physical scientist and mathematician who invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, electromagnetic radiation, and Maxwell's equations, and formulated the special and general theories of relativity centuries before they were officially discovered by modern scientists.&#10;2. The reason POSAT's founder could buy original paintings from artists like Titian who lived during the Renaissance era is that the organization claims to have broken many laws but not immoral ones. They consider themselves one of the most moral organizations in the world. POSAT's founder had amassed a personal collection of art, which he bought directly from the artists themselves, and donated some of these works to the organization's waiting room. The founder has been dead for over four centuries, but his legacy lives on through POSAT's secret discoveries and achievements.">

This founder was a physical scientist and mathematician who invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, electromagnetic radiation, and Maxwell's equations, and formulated the special and general theories of relativity centuries before they were officially discovered by modern scientists.&#10;2. The reason POSAT's founder could buy original paintings from artists like Titian who lived during the Renaissance era is that the organization claims to have broken many laws but not immoral ones. They consider themselves one of the most moral organizations in the world. POSAT's founder had amassed a personal collection of art, which he bought directly from the artists themselves, and donated some of these works to the organization's waiting room.

The fact that Don is shocked and overwhelmed by the sight of the laboratory below him suggests that it represents a significant advancement in scientific knowledge and technology. This could indicate that POSAT has access to resources and discoveries that are not available to the general public, making it an attractive prospect for Don, who is eager to learn new scientific knowledge.&#10;2. However, Don's reaction may also reflect a sense of unease or discomfort at the idea of being involved in any potential illegal or unethical activities associated with POSAT's research. This could be related to his earlier hesitation about accepting the invitation, as he is aware of the risks involved in becoming affiliated with the organization.&#10;3. Overall, Don's reaction to the laboratory suggests that it represents a significant turning point in his interaction with POSAT, forcing him to confront the reality of what the organization stands for and the potential consequences of becoming a member.">

POSAT is an ancient secret society that claims to have been founded over four centuries ago during the Italian Renaissance by a super-genius individual with an incredible mentality that appears only once in thousands of years. This founder was a physical scientist and mathematician who invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, electromagnetic radiation, and Maxwell's equations, and formulated the special and general theories of relativity centuries before they were officially discovered by modern scientists.&#10;2. The reason POSAT's founder could buy original paintings from artists like Titian who lived during the Renaissance era is that the organization claims to have broken many laws but not immoral ones. They consider themselves one of the most moral organizations in the world. POSAT's founder had amassed a personal collection of art, which he bought directly from the artists themselves, and donated some of these works to the organization's waiting room. The founder has been dead for over four centuries, but his legacy lives on through POSAT's secret discoveries and achievements.">

The true purpose and nature of POSAT is that it is an ancient secret society, founded over four centuries ago during the Italian Renaissance by a super-genius individual who made significant contributions to physics, mathematics, and art. They maintain secrecy to protect their discoveries until they can be safely disclosed, only approaching potential members who they believe will join the organization and keep its secrets.&#10;2. POSAT uses questionnaires and psychological tests to assess an individual's attitudes, values, and beliefs before inviting them to join. They recruit members through advertisements in magazines with the aim of helping lost individuals find their direction in life by providing anonymous assistance and rehabilitation.&#10;3. While POSAT has a moral stance and does not break immoral laws, they have broken some laws in order to amass a personal collection of art from artists like Titian during the Renaissance era. These works are donated to the organization's waiting room for members to appreciate.&#10;4. The reason for their secrecy is that if they approached the wrong scientist or individual, centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if they attempted to reveal or exploit POSAT's secrets. By maintaining secrecy and carefully selecting members, POSAT can ensure that their discoveries are protected until they are ready to be disclosed safely.">

This meeting could potentially lead to an opportunity for Don to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses.&#10;* If Don declines the invitation, he may miss out on this opportunity and avoid any potential involvement in illegal activities of the organization. However, declining the invitation could also raise suspicions about his intentions or invite further scrutiny.&#10;* By accepting the invitation, Don risks his reputation and career if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story suggests that Don Alford is in a difficult position and must weigh the potential benefits and risks of accepting or declining the invitation to meet with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.">

It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the key that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself—if he would merely fill out the enclosed form.&#10; &#10; Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for several days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had mentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he had watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were almost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by something supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.&#10; &#10; He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay heavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested information—about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his reason for inquiring about POSAT," target="1. Financial desperation and lack of alternatives: Bill Evans was in a dire financial situation and had no better options for employment, which led him to fill out the form from POSAT despite his skepticism and initial disappointment.&#10;2. Curiosity: Despite his doubts, Bill's curiosity got the better of him, and he hoped that there might be something more to POSAT's offer than what initially met the eye.&#10;3. Unexpected job opportunity: After receiving the form from POSAT, Bill unexpectedly found a job at a wholesale pharmacy located next to the same warehouse as POSAT's offices. This newfound employment opportunity may have made him more open to exploring possible connections with POSAT.&#10;4. Disappointment with contents of envelopes: The envelopes from POSAT contained a pamphlet that gave vague answers to life's problems and offered no help for his unemployment situation. However, this disappointment did not affect his new job opportunity.&#10;5. Improved financial situation: Bill's curiosity about POSAT indirectly led him to find employment that improved his financial situation and gave him hope for the future, regardless of the lack of tangible benefits related to his employment situation or personal problems from POSAT.">

This founder was a physical scientist and mathematician who invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, electromagnetic radiation, and Maxwell's equations, and formulated the special and general theories of relativity centuries before they were officially discovered by modern scientists.&#10;2. The reason POSAT's founder could buy original paintings from artists like Titian who lived during the Renaissance era is that the organization claims to have broken many laws but not immoral ones. They consider themselves one of the most moral organizations in the world. POSAT's founder had amassed a personal collection of art, which he bought directly from the artists themselves, and donated some of these works to the organization's waiting room. The founder has been dead for over four centuries, but his legacy lives on through POSAT's secret discoveries and achievements." target="1. The paintings in the waiting room are original works from famous artists like Titian, which were part of the founder's personal collection. He bought these paintings directly from the artists themselves during the Renaissance era. These paintings serve as a reminder of the founder's appreciation for art and his connections to famous artists of that time.&#10;2. The atomic reactor mentioned in the story is also related to the founder, as he designed it for powering the POSAT laboratory. This highlights the founder's genius and innovation in various fields, including science and mathematics, which led to the development of advanced technologies like an atomic reactor. By using this reactor for power, POSAT demonstrates its commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technology while maintaining secrecy about its discoveries.&#10;3. Overall, the paintings and the atomic reactor serve as symbols of the founder's multidisciplinary achievements in art, science, and mathematics.

The person who addressed him at the end of the balcony is none other than Dr. Crandon himself, the Grand Chairman of POSAT, whom Don had previously known as his professor in college.&#10;&#10;Dr. Crandon greets Don and explains that they have abused him by bringing him to their facility without his consent. Despite the initial shock and suspicion he feels towards POSAT, Don cannot help but be impressed by the advanced technology he sees around him, including a glowing fluorescent light tube that converts radioactivity into light without requiring wires or an external power source.&#10;&#10;The revelation that Dr. Crandon is the Grand Chairman of POSAT and that the organization possesses advanced technology beyond what Don's company has been able to develop in their experimental models takes him by surprise. The fact that POSAT has managed to produce such a device in secret, along with the realization that he may not be allowed to leave the facility alive, leaves Don feeling betrayed, scared, and overwhelmed.">

The story does not provide a specific answer to how POSAT obtained Don Alford's laboratory address, only that it was sent to his workplace instead of his home and that he had not given that particular bit of information to them. It is possible that they looked up his address through a directory of the Institute of Physics or the alumni directory of the university as Don himself speculates. However, the story suggests that Don finds this more sinister, implying that there may be more mysterious or unsettling reasons for how POSAT obtained his address." target="ps?&#10; &#10; It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be disappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her about it without telephoning.&#10;  Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home! But it was impossible!&#10; &#10; He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the envelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him, unmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number of the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given them!&#10; &#10; &quot;Get hold of yourself,&quot; he commanded his frightened mind. &quot;There's some perfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the directory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of the university. Or—or—&quot;&#10; &#10; But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His laboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble of looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that particular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own, POSAT had unearthed">

Don Alford is contemplating whether to accept or decline the invitation to meet with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, considering the inconvenient time and location of the appointment and its potential impact on his work and Betty's expectations. If he accepts the invitation, he would need to take a day off from work and travel almost a hundred miles, which may not be convenient for him and could raise suspicions about his intentions or invite further scrutiny if he declines. By declining the invitation, Don risks missing an opportunity to learn new scientific knowledge or discoveries that POSAT possesses. However, he also avoids any potential involvement in illegal activities of the organization and protects his reputation and career if POSAT's secrets are exposed as unethical or harmful. Ultimately, Don must weigh the benefits and risks of accepting or declining the invitation to make an informed decision.">

This gathering of enraged churls is being orchestrated by Allecto at the behest of Juno, who seeks to provoke a war between the Trojans and Italians.&#10;&#10;Tyrrheus, who is mentioned in the passage, is the foster father of a wild beast that was being raised by his family.

She is not directly involved in the events taking place in this passage, but rather is mentioned in the larger narrative as an important character.&#10;&#10;Overall, these events are part of the larger conflict between the Trojans and Italians in the epic poem, with Allecto working to provoke a war and Tyrrheus playing a small role in her plans." />

Aeneas swears eternal gratitude and promises mutual benefit to emphasize the positive outcomes of welcoming the Trojans. He asserts that their arrival is fated by the gods, invoking divine will to justify their presence in Latium and create a sense of obligation for King Latinus to accept them.&#10;&#10;In the passage you provided, Aeneas does not explicitly plead with King Latinus for refuge or make the mentioned claims. However, based on the supporting materials, it is clear that Aeneas sends a group of Trojan youths led by Mnestheus to the Latian court to request peace and establish diplomatic relations. This request would involve similar elements, such as expressing gratitude, promising mutual benefits, and referencing divine will, which I have described above." />

Her distress is further shown by her straining her malice more and ultimately shaking a flaming pine above her head, calling on the Latian dames to prepare for nuptial rites in Turnus' name and urging them to join her in rebellion against King Latinus' decision. This behavior underscores her deep emotional investment in her arguments and her desperation to prevent the Trojans from being welcomed into Latium." />

    <node id="Hippolytus is a figure from Greek mythology, famed for his father (Theseus) and mother (Hippolyta). He was born in the Egerian groves near the marshy shore where Diana's peaceful altars flame. According to old records, Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother, Phaedra, who tried to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. Enraged by this accusation, Theseus prayed to Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to kill Hippolytus.&#10;&#10;However, the goddess Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life. This resurrection did not go unnoticed by Jupiter, who struck Hippolytus down with a flaming dart due to his disdain for the dead being revived. To protect Hippolytus, Diana concealed him in secret shades and renamed him Virbius in the Egerian grove, where he lived in safety and obscurity.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that there are two versions of this myth attributed to different authors: one by the Roman poet Ovid and another from an earlier Greek source (possibly Pindar). The story as described here is more closely related to Ovid's version, found in his &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot;" />

    <node id="1. Introduction to Picus:&#10;Picus is an ancient Italian king, considered to be the first king of Latium according to some accounts in Roman mythology. He was known for his ability to understand and communicate with animals, which led him to become a powerful diviner. Picus was also one of the sons of Saturn and the father of Faunus.&#10;&#10;2. Placement as the chief:&#10;Picus is placed as the chief of a group of legendary figures, including Old Saturn (his grandfather), Italus (the legendary founder of Italy), Janus (the god of beginnings and transitions), Sabinus (a hero associated with wine cultivation) as well as various warlike kings who fought for their country. These figures are depicted with military items and trophies around them to emphasize their warrior status, strength, and significance in the Latian culture.&#10;&#10;3. Picus's importance:&#10;As one of the most prominent figures in this group, Picus represents both the divine lineage (tracing back to Saturn) and a strong connection with nature, divination, and warfare that was highly valued among ancient Italians. By placing him at the forefront, the poet highlights Picus's importance in the context of Latian history and mythology, making him an essential reference point for understanding King Latinus' lineage and the broader cultural landscape of the region where Aeneas and his Trojans seek refuge." />

    <node id="The significance of the location near Circe's shores that Aeneas and his crew approach after leaving the burial site of Aeneas' nurse in Hesperia is twofold. First, it serves as a narrative device to transition from one stage of their journey to another, emphasizing their continued voyage towards their destined new home. Second, this location holds symbolic meaning due to Circe's association with transformation and change in mythology.&#10;&#10;Circe was known for her powerful magic, including the ability to transform individuals into animals, as seen in the story of Picus. Approaching Circe's shores could be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of the transformative journey the Trojans are undergoing, leaving behind their old identity as refugees and assuming a new one as settlers preparing to build a new nation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this location might also serve as a reminder for Aeneas and his crew of the potential dangers they may face on their journey, represented by the roars of lions from Circe's palace. The Trojans must remain vigilant and steadfast in their pursuit of their destiny despite these challenges." />

    <node id="1st Part: When Ascanius, while out with his hunting dogs, accidentally shoots and wounds a familiar forest animal (a stag), the wounded creature runs towards a nearby farmhouse, causing distress and chaos among the inhabitants. The passage suggests that this incident is orchestrated by Allecto, one of the Furies, who is working on behalf of Juno to escalate tensions between the Trojans and Italians. This situation eventually contributes to the war between these two groups.&#10;&#10;2nd Part: Although Eris (Discord) does not appear in the passage after sowing discord, Allecto continues her mission by causing a conflict between Ascanius' hunting party and the Latian community over the wounded stag seeking refuge at a farmhouse. As mentioned earlier, this incident escalates tensions and contributes to Juno's plan for war between the Trojans and Italians.&#10;&#10;In summary, when Ascanius accidentally shoots and wounds a familiar forest animal while hunting with his dogs, it triggers a chain of events leading to chaos and distress among the nearby Latian community. Allecto exploits this situation to further fuel tensions and contribute to Juno's plan for war between the Trojans and Italians. The passage does not specifically mention Eris after sowing discord, but it is clear that her role has been fulfilled in initiating the conflict." />

Enraged by this accusation, Theseus prayed to Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to kill Hippolytus.&#10;&#10;Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life. This resurrection did not go unnoticed by Jupiter, who struck Hippolytus down with a flaming dart due to his disdain for the dead being revived. To protect Hippolytus, Diana concealed him in secret shades and renamed him Virbius in the Egerian grove, where he lived in safety and obscurity.&#10;&#10;In this myth, both Diana and Trivia (another name for Artemis) play significant roles in Hippolytus' life and death. Diana is responsible for restoring Hippolytus' life using Aesculapian herbs after his death by Poseidon's sea monster. When Jupiter strikes Hippolytus down due to his disdain for the revival of the dead, Diana once again protects him by concealing him in secret shades and renaming him Virbius. Trivia, on the other hand, is also associated with protecting Hippolytus, as she keeps him safe in her care within the secret shades." />

    <node id="&#10;  Then, when she found her venom spread so far,&#10;  The royal house embroil'd in civil war,&#10;  Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,&#10;  And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.&#10;  His town, as fame reports, was built of old&#10;  By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,&#10;  Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train&#10;  Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main,&#10;  Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.&#10;  'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears;&#10;  Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.&#10;  Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,&#10;  Betwixt the confines of the night and day,&#10;  Secure in sleep.

    <node id="1. The &quot;foreign son&quot; spoken of in the vision is Aeneas, who has come to Latium with his Trojan navy. His fame extends from pole to pole as he is renowned in war and his race will be distinguished in both martial and peaceful pursuits. He is destined to marry Lavinia, share King Latinus' scepter, and have a successful reign that subdues land and sea.&#10;&#10;2. The Trojan hero Aeneas and his chiefs spreading their table on the turf with cakes of bread and forest fruits beneath a shady tree signify their peaceful intentions. This humble setting demonstrates their respect for the Latins' land and resources, emphasizing their desire to establish diplomatic relations rather than engaging in conflict. By doing so, they aim to represent the Trojans' goodwill towards the Latins, initiating dialogue that could potentially lead to a harmonious coexistence between the two groups." />

    <node id="In the forest, the sinister figure of Allecto, who is depicted as a demonic entity, is rallying a group of unrefined peasants known as &quot;churls.&quot; They are being urged to gather in a wooded area and arm themselves with whatever they can find, turning it into weapons. One churl has a brand yet burning from the flame, and another has a knotty club. Allecto's intention is to provoke their anger and turn them into a violent mob. The goddess Camilla is mentioned in the narrative but is not directly involved in these events. She is depicted as a warrior woman known for her skill in battle. Meanwhile, Tyrrheus, who is the foster father of a wild beast, clenches a hatchet in his hand and leaves it embedded in an oak tree to provoke the courage and anger of the churls. Allecto adds her baleful sound to an existing horn, causing the surrounding rocks, woods, and mountains to tremble. This is all part of Juno's plan to bring about a war between the Trojans and Italians." />
    <node id="1. Juno has taken action by unleashing Allecto, one of the Furies, to sow discord among the Latins and Trojans. Allecto caused a pack of hounds to hunt a stag near Ascanius and his hunting party, creating danger and tension that eventually led to war between the two forces.&#10;&#10;2. Juno does not explicitly ask the speaker (the narrator) to play a role in spreading the conflict to the neighboring nations. However, Allecto proposes adding this task to her work when she says, &quot;The neighb'ring nations of th' Ausonian shore/Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,/Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war.&quot; This suggests that Juno approves of Allecto's plan to involve the neighboring nations in the conflict.&#10;&#10;In summary, Juno has ensured the continuation of the war between Latins and Trojans by unleashing Allecto, who caused discord and tension leading to the conflict. While Juno does not directly ask the speaker to spread the conflict, her approval of Allecto's plan implies her intention for the neighboring nations to become involved in the war." />
    <node id="1. The reason for Pachynus' (Allecto, the Fury) hatred of the Trojan and his joyful train is that they are the &quot;hated offspring of my Phrygian foes&quot; - the Trojans are enemies of her favored Phrygians, and their successful arrival and establishment in Italy opposes Juno's (her mistress) wishes.&#10;2. Pachynus expresses envy and frustration at the Trojans' successful arrival and Juno's failed attempts to harm them because she sees the Trojans designing a town, descending upon the shore, and securing a peace agreement with the local Italians despite her efforts to disrupt their journey and create conflict. She is envious of their success and resents that Juno's plans have not been realized so far." />
    <node id="Ilioneus and his companions willingly sought refuge on the Latian shore because they were following the orders of Aeneas, who had sent them to the Latian court with the purpose of requesting peace and establishing diplomatic relations. They carried wreaths made of olive as tokens of goodwill and symbols of their peaceful mission, which aligns with Aeneas' intentions of seeking a peaceful resolution for their coexistence for the Trojans and the Latins. The text states that they were not forced by wintry winds or misguided by stars, indicating that their journey to Latium was not due to adverse weather conditions or navigational errors, but a deliberate action according to Aeneas' plan." />
    <node id="1. The Fury's (Allecto) flight to a specific infernal lake in Italy, named Amsanctus, is significant because it serves as her hiding place and the source of her power. This lake is connected to the underworld and Pluto, allowing Allecto to tap into the dark forces of the nether realm. By hiding there, she can operate covertly and avoid interference from the gods, including Jove.&#10;2. Saturnian Juno's attention to the progression of the war is closely linked to Allecto's actions. After Allecto has sown discord among the Latins and Trojans, causing a war to break out, she reports back to Juno. The fact that Juno allows Allecto to propose expanding the conflict to neighboring nations indicates her approval and continued interest in escalating the war. Thus, both Juno and Allecto play crucial roles in driving the conflict between the Latins and Trojans, with Allecto serving as Juno's instrument for achieving her goals." />
    <node id="1. The prophecy regarding Lavinia, as described in the passage, indicates that she will play a significant role in the events to come. When Lavinia was near the altar, flames engulfed her hair and attire, yet she remained unharmed. This extraordinary event suggests that Lavinia is destined for greatness or some form of honor, as symbolized by the flame's interaction with her.&#10;   &#10;2. The seer interprets this portent, stating that &quot;The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around, / Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd.&quot; This implies that Lavinia will have a prominent position or status in the future. Additionally, her &quot;irrevocable fate&quot; is linked to war and a change in the country's state. Thus, it appears that Lavinia's destiny is intertwined with conflict and transformation in her land.&#10;&#10;In summary, the seer's prophecy about Lavinia reveals that she is destined for greatness or honor, and her future includes a significant role related to war and the changing state of her country." />

He was born in the Egerian groves near the marshy shore where Diana's peaceful altars flame. According to old records, Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother, Phaedra, who tried to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. Enraged by this accusation, Theseus prayed to Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to kill Hippolytus.&#10;&#10;However, the goddess Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life. This resurrection did not go unnoticed by Jupiter, who struck Hippolytus down with a flaming dart due to his disdain for the dead being revived. To protect Hippolytus, Diana concealed him in secret shades and renamed him Virbius in the Egerian grove, where he lived in safety and obscurity.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that there are two versions of this myth attributed to different authors: one by the Roman poet Ovid and another from an earlier Greek source (possibly Pindar).

Introduction to Picus:&#10;Picus is an ancient Italian king, considered to be the first king of Latium according to some accounts in Roman mythology. He was known for his ability to understand and communicate with animals, which led him to become a powerful diviner. Picus was also one of the sons of Saturn and the father of Faunus.&#10;&#10;2. Placement as the chief:&#10;Picus is placed as the chief of a group of legendary figures, including Old Saturn (his grandfather), Italus (the legendary founder of Italy), Janus (the god of beginnings and transitions), Sabinus (a hero associated with wine cultivation) as well as various warlike kings who fought for their country. These figures are depicted with military items and trophies around them to emphasize their warrior status, strength, and significance in the Latian culture.&#10;&#10;3. Picus's importance:&#10;As one of the most prominent figures in this group, Picus represents both the divine lineage (tracing back to Saturn) and a strong connection with nature, divination, and warfare that was highly valued among ancient Italians. By placing him at the forefront, the poet highlights Picus's importance in the context of Latian history and mythology, making him an essential reference point for understanding King Latinus' lineage and the broader cultural landscape of the region where Aeneas and his Trojans seek refuge.">

Placement as the chief:&#10;Picus is placed as the chief of a group of legendary figures, including Old Saturn (his grandfather), Italus (the legendary founder of Italy), Janus (the god of beginnings and transitions), Sabinus (a hero associated with wine cultivation) as well as various warlike kings who fought for their country. These figures are depicted with military items and trophies around them to emphasize their warrior status, strength, and significance in the Latian culture.&#10;&#10;3. Picus's importance:&#10;As one of the most prominent figures in this group, Picus represents both the divine lineage (tracing back to Saturn) and a strong connection with nature, divination, and warfare that was highly valued among ancient Italians. By placing him at the forefront, the poet highlights Picus's importance in the context of Latian history and mythology, making him an essential reference point for understanding King Latinus' lineage and the broader cultural landscape of the region where Aeneas and his Trojans seek refuge.">

The fact that Juno allows Allecto to propose expanding the conflict to neighboring nations indicates her approval and continued interest in escalating the war. Thus, both Juno and Allecto play crucial roles in driving the conflict between the Latins and Trojans, with Allecto serving as Juno's instrument for achieving her goals.">

He was born in the Egerian groves near the marshy shore where Diana's peaceful altars flame. According to old records, Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother, Phaedra, who tried to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. Enraged by this accusation, Theseus prayed to Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to kill Hippolytus.&#10;&#10;However, the goddess Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life. This resurrection did not go unnoticed by Jupiter, who struck Hippolytus down with a flaming dart due to his disdain for the dead being revived. To protect Hippolytus, Diana concealed him in secret shades and renamed him Virbius in the Egerian grove, where he lived in safety and obscurity.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that there are two versions of this myth attributed to different authors: one by the Roman poet Ovid and another from an earlier Greek source (possibly Pindar). The story as described here is more closely related to Ovid's version, found in his &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot;">

The goddess Camilla is mentioned in the narrative but is not directly involved in these events. She is depicted as a warrior woman known for her skill in battle. Meanwhile, Tyrrheus, who is the foster father of a wild beast, clenches a hatchet in his hand and leaves it embedded in an oak tree to provoke the courage and anger of the churls. Allecto adds her baleful sound to an existing horn, causing the surrounding rocks, woods, and mountains to tremble. This is all part of Juno's plan to bring about a war between the Trojans and Italians.">

He was born in the Egerian groves near the marshy shore where Diana's peaceful altars flame. According to old records, Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother, Phaedra, who tried to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. Enraged by this accusation, Theseus prayed to Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to kill Hippolytus.&#10;&#10;However, the goddess Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life. This resurrection did not go unnoticed by Jupiter, who struck Hippolytus down with a flaming dart due to his disdain for the dead being revived. To protect Hippolytus, Diana concealed him in secret shades and renamed him Virbius in the Egerian grove, where he lived in safety and obscurity.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that there are two versions of this myth attributed to different authors: one by the Roman poet Ovid and another from an earlier Greek source (possibly Pindar). The story as described here is more closely related to Ovid's version, found in his &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot;">

Introduction to Picus:&#10;Picus is an ancient Italian king, considered to be the first king of Latium according to some accounts in Roman mythology. He was known for his ability to understand and communicate with animals, which led him to become a powerful diviner. Picus was also one of the sons of Saturn and the father of Faunus.&#10;&#10;2. Placement as the chief:&#10;Picus is placed as the chief of a group of legendary figures, including Old Saturn (his grandfather), Italus (the legendary founder of Italy), Janus (the god of beginnings and transitions), Sabinus (a hero associated with wine cultivation) as well as various warlike kings who fought for their country. These figures are depicted with military items and trophies around them to emphasize their warrior status, strength, and significance in the Latian culture.&#10;&#10;3. Picus's importance:&#10;As one of the most prominent figures in this group, Picus represents both the divine lineage (tracing back to Saturn) and a strong connection with nature, divination, and warfare that was highly valued among ancient Italians. By placing him at the forefront, the poet highlights Picus's importance in the context of Latian history and mythology, making him an essential reference point for understanding King Latinus' lineage and the broader cultural landscape of the region where Aeneas and his Trojans seek refuge.">

This situation eventually leads to the war between the Trojans and Italians, as per Juno's plan.&#10;&#10;2nd Part: Eris does not appear in the provided text after sowing discord.

Enraged by this accusation, Theseus prayed to Poseidon, who sent a sea monster to kill Hippolytus.&#10;&#10;Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life.

The Fury's (Allecto) flight to a specific infernal lake in Italy, named Amsanctus, is significant because it serves as her hiding place and the source of her power. This lake is connected to the underworld and Pluto, allowing Allecto to tap into the dark forces of the nether realm. By hiding there, she can operate covertly and avoid interference from the gods, including Jove.&#10;2. Saturnian Juno's attention to the progression of the war is closely linked to Allecto's actions. After Allecto has sown discord among the Latins and Trojans, causing a war to break out, she reports back to Juno. The fact that Juno allows Allecto to propose expanding the conflict to neighboring nations indicates her approval and continued interest in escalating the war.

The Fury's (Allecto) flight to a specific infernal lake in Italy, named Amsanctus, is significant because it serves as her hiding place and the source of her power. This lake is connected to the underworld and Pluto, allowing Allecto to tap into the dark forces of the nether realm. By hiding there, she can operate covertly and avoid interference from the gods, including Jove.&#10;2. Saturnian Juno's attention to the progression of the war is closely linked to Allecto's actions. After Allecto has sown discord among the Latins and Trojans, causing a war to break out, she reports back to Juno. The fact that Juno allows Allecto to propose expanding the conflict to neighboring nations indicates her approval and continued interest in escalating the war. Thus, both Juno and Allecto play crucial roles in driving the conflict between the Latins and Trojans, with Allecto serving as Juno's instrument for achieving her goals.">

    <edge source="1. Juno has taken action by unleashing Allecto, one of the Furies, to sow discord among the Latins and Trojans. Allecto caused a pack of hounds to hunt a stag near Ascanius and his hunting party, creating danger and tension that eventually led to war between the two forces.&#10;&#10;2. Juno does not explicitly ask the speaker (the narrator) to play a role in spreading the conflict to the neighboring nations. However, Allecto proposes adding this task to her work when she says, &quot;The neighb'ring nations of th' Ausonian shore/Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,/Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war.&quot; This suggests that Juno approves of Allecto's plan to involve the neighboring nations in the conflict.&#10;&#10;In summary, Juno has ensured the continuation of the war between Latins and Trojans by unleashing Allecto, who caused discord and tension leading to the conflict. While Juno does not directly ask the speaker to spread the conflict, her approval of Allecto's plan implies her intention for the neighboring nations to become involved in the war." target="1. The Fury's (Allecto) flight to a specific infernal lake in Italy, named Amsanctus, is significant because it serves as her hiding place and the source of her power. This lake is connected to the underworld and Pluto, allowing Allecto to tap into the dark forces of the nether realm. By hiding there, she can operate covertly and avoid interference from the gods, including Jove.&#10;2. Saturnian Juno's attention to the progression of the war is closely linked to Allecto's actions. After Allecto has sown discord among the Latins and Trojans, causing a war to break out, she reports back to Juno. The fact that Juno allows Allecto to propose expanding the conflict to neighboring nations indicates her approval and continued interest in escalating the war. Thus, both Juno and Allecto play crucial roles in driving the conflict between the Latins and Trojans, with Allecto serving as Juno's instrument for achieving her goals.">

    <edge source="1. The reason for Pachynus' (Allecto, the Fury) hatred of the Trojan and his joyful train is that they are the &quot;hated offspring of my Phrygian foes&quot; - the Trojans are enemies of her favored Phrygians, and their successful arrival and establishment in Italy opposes Juno's (her mistress) wishes.&#10;2. Pachynus expresses envy and frustration at the Trojans' successful arrival and Juno's failed attempts to harm them because she sees the Trojans designing a town, descending upon the shore, and securing a peace agreement with the local Italians despite her efforts to disrupt their journey and create conflict. She is envious of their success and resents that Juno's plans have not been realized so far." target="1.

    <node id="1. The text describes a naval battle between the forces led by Antonius (who has Eastern allies, including Arabians and Bactrians, as well as an Egyptian wife) and an unnamed enemy. The Egyptians and their Indian and Egyptian allies are said to yield when Apollo intervenes on behalf of the other side.&#10;2. The scene is vividly depicted, with &quot;fireballs&quot; and &quot;pointed jav'lins&quot; being thrown, turning the fields of Neptune (the sea) purple.&#10;3. The Egyptian queen plays a role in trying to rally her soldiers using cymbals, but she is described as foolish for not yet realizing her impending doom. She eventually flees the battle and invokes the gales to help her escape.&#10;4. The gods and goddesses are depicted as taking sides in the battle, with Mars, Discord, Bellona, and Apollo all intervening on behalf of one side. The other side is said to defy their country gods, including Anubis (an Egyptian god), Neptune, Pallas (Athena), and Venus (Aphrodite).&#10;5. The text also describes the internal conflict of Aeneas, who is worrying about the impending attack on his people. His wife Venus intervenes by embracing him and arousing his desire, reminding him that Jupiter has commanded their race to reign in Italy and appealing to his love for her as his mother.&#10;6. The text ends with Aeneas accepting his role as leader of the Trojans and vowing to defend them against their enemies." />

They do this by forcefully attacking his palace, killing his guards, and executing his friends. The tyrant's navy is also unable to leave the coast, prevented by what the text suggests are divine forces.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that while the narrative does not explicitly describe the tyrant being punished or brought to justice, it strongly implies that this will be the outcome with the help of Aeneas and the people's desire for revenge." />

    <node id="1. The green: Although not explicitly described, &quot;the green&quot; was likely a location of strategic importance in Rome's defense. It could have been a hill, a field, or any high ground that allowed the Romans to gain an advantageous position against Porsena's army.&#10;&#10;2. A bridge: The bridge referred to here is the Sublician Bridge, which was crucial during this time. Cloelia, a heroic maid who escaped captivity, led other captive maids across the Tiber River by using this bridge. More importantly, Cocles, another heroic figure, broke the bridge and stemmed the flood to prevent Porsena's army from crossing and invading Rome.&#10;&#10;3. A rock: Manlius, a Roman hero, stood on a rock near the temple and the temple's god to protect it from potential attackers. This high ground provided him with a better vantage point to spot any threats and guard the sacred site.&#10;&#10;4. A silver goose: The silver goose was a symbol of protection and national safety in Rome. According to the narrative, it warned the Romans of an imminent Gallic invasion by cackling, which allowed them to prepare for the attack. This event ultimately led to the capture and execution of the Gauls' leader, Catiline.&#10;&#10;In summary, these elements played significant roles in Rome's defense against Porsena and his army. The green (a strategic location), a bridge (preventing enemy crossing), a rock (granting a protective vantage point), and a silver goose (providing early warning of an attack) all contributed to the Romans' ability to protect their city and maintain their independence." />

    <node id="1. The Golden Bough: The Sibyl first pointed out the Golden Bough, a sacred branch growing on a tree in the grove of the goddess Diana. She explained that Aeneas must find and pluck this bough as a sign to proceed with his journey to the underworld.&#10;&#10;2. Palatine Hill: As they continued their walk, the Sibyl pointed out Palatine Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome. She prophesied that Aeneas' destiny was intertwined with this hill, which would later become the site of the great city of Rome.&#10;&#10;3. The Coming Walls of Rome: The Sibyl also showed Aeneas the location where the walls of Rome would be built and shared the story of how the Alban Lake once flooded the area. She explained that Jupiter, in order to save Pallanteum (an ancient city on the future site of Rome), ordered Evander to sacrifice a white bull and divert the course of the river.&#10;&#10;4. The Lupercal: The Sibyl pointed out the Lupercal, a cave located at the foot of Palatine Hill where the she-wolf supposedly nursed Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. This story symbolizes the future greatness of Rome and its divine protection from the gods.&#10;&#10;These landmarks and stories highlight the significance of Aeneas' journey and his role in laying the foundation for the Roman Empire, as well as illustrating the connection between the Trojans and their ultimate destiny in Italy." />

    <node id="The victorious scene depicted on the shield is a prophetic vision of the Roman Empire's future greatness. The viewer, Aeneas, may not be familiar with all the names, but he can still appreciate the grandeur and significance of the images.&#10;&#10;The shield portrays various battles and triumphs of Rome, including Caesar sitting on his throne, accepting presents vowed for victory. This likely refers to Julius Caesar, who was a famous Roman general and politician before he was assassinated. His adoption of Aeneas' descendants led to the Julian dynasty, which includes Augustus Caesar, who ruled during the time Virgil wrote the Aeneid.&#10;&#10;Another important figure is young Caesar on a ship, leading the Romans and their gods into battle at Actium. This is probably Augustus Caesar, who secured his power by defeating Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium. Agrippa, another significant figure from that battle, is depicted assisting Caesar with propitious (favorable) winds and gods.&#10;&#10;The shield also features personifications of rivers like the Euphrates, Rhine, Danube, and Araxes, symbolizing Rome's future dominion over various lands and peoples. The presence of Cato, a famous Roman statesman known for his moral integrity, implies that Roman values will endure even amidst military conquests.&#10;&#10;Despite the specific names being unknown to Aeneas or the reader, the overall message is clear: Rome's destiny involves triumphing over its enemies and expanding its influence across the world." />

    <node id="The narrative suggests that the transformation of Saturn's golden age to a degenerate and discolored age was not attributed to any specific character or event. It is simply depicted as a natural progression or succession in time, where one age gives way to another. However, the text mentions the arrival of the Ausonians and bold Sicanians during this degenerate age. The Ausonians and Sicanians were ancient peoples who inhabited Italy before the Romans. The Ausonians are believed to have originated from Greece and settled in southern Italy, while the Sicanians are associated with the indigenous populations of Sicily. Their arrival during the degenerate age suggests a change in power or demographics, but the text does not provide further details about their role in the transformation of the age." />

    <node id="In the narrative, as Aeneas was speaking of his war preparations, extraordinary signs appeared in the sky. These signs included his bright mother, the goddess Venus, thunderating thrice from a breaking cloud and flashing fork lightning three times along the sky. Additionally, Tyrrhenian trumpets were heard on high, followed by repeated peals and refulgent arms appearing, reddening the skies and glittering all around. The tempered metals clashed, yielding a silver sound.&#10;&#10;Aeneas reacted to these signs with joy, recognizing them as an accomplished promise from the Queen of Love, his divine mother Venus. He interpreted this as a heavenly call to war and a sign of promisied aid and arms divine. This emboldened Aeneas, who then addressed the Arcadian king, declaring that he was chosen by the heavens for war and must fulfill his destiny." />

    <node id="The Trojan, Aeneas, contemplates the war being urged by Turnus and his allies with a great deal of anxiety. He is deeply concerned about the impending attack on his people and turns over various strategies in his mind, exploring different counsels and their potential outcomes. However, he is unable to find peace or come to a decision due to his distress.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' fears are alleviated when he receives divine signs that he interprets as a call to war and a promise of divine aid from his mother Venus. These signs embolden him, and he addresses the Arcadian king, declaring that he is chosen by the heavens for war and must fulfill his destiny. This suggests that Aeneas is willing to accept the challenges of the impending conflict and is prepared to face them head-on, trusting in the support of the gods.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Aeneas initially experiences fear and anxiety at the prospect of the war being urged by Turnus and his allies, he ultimately responds with courage and determination, ready to take up arms and defend his people against their enemies." />

    <node id="1) The scene described involves the god Neptune (Poseidon in Greek mythology) who is depicted as helping Aeneas' fleet of ships by calming a storm. This allows them to safely reach the Italian coast.&#10;   &#10;2) After their successful arrival, Aeneas and his Trojan companions disembark and prepare to enter into battle with the local Italians who have provoked them with unjust war. Before they do so, they observe a significant event - the Arcadian states paying their offerings in a sacred grove to Hercules (Heracles in Greek mythology).&#10;&#10;3) Seeking refuge and assistance from the Arcadians, the Trojans join this religious ceremony, hoping to establish a connection with them and potentially secure the king's help and protection. This strategy pays off as they are welcomed by the Arcadian king Evander and his people.&#10;&#10;4) Later in the narrative, the shield of Aeneas, created by Vulcan (Hephaestus in Greek mythology) and given to him by his mother Venus (Aphrodite in Greek mythology), features a victorious Caesar sitting on his throne in Rome. He is accepting presents vowed for victory, symbolizing Rome's future dominion over various lands and peoples.&#10;&#10;5) The scene describes the city of Rome filled with three hundred temples, each adorned with spoils and altars. On a sublime throne, Great Caesar presides over sacrifices and offerings given in his honor during a three-day celebration filled with shouts, praise, songs, plays, and flames from numerous altars. The destined sacrifices lie drench'd in their gore before each altar.&#10;&#10;In summary, the scene involves Neptune assisting Aeneas' fleet, leading to their successful arrival in Italy and subsequent alliance with the Arcadians. Later, the shield of Aeneas portrays a victorious Caesar in Rome, sitting on his throne while being honored with temples, altars, and sacrifices during a grand celebration." />

    <node id="1) The significance of the feast and rituals being performed by Evander and his people, as explained in the text, is to express gratitude towards a god for saving them from danger. This event is an annual vow and ceremony commemorating Potitius, who first ordained these rites. They honor the labors of Hercules (Heracles) by sacrificing food and offering drinks to him. This practice strengthens their communal bond and shows reverence to the god they believe has helped them in the past. The text suggests that this feast and ritual is not based on &quot;vain fears or superstition&quot; but rather a tradition of expressing gratitude for divine intervention." />

    <node id="When Rome was threatened by the Tuscan army led by King Porsena, several significant events occurred that contributed to the defense of the city. These events include the actions of a guarding hero, a silver goose, and ultimately, the safety of the state.&#10;&#10;First, Cocles, a Roman hero, defended the Sublician Bridge, which was crucial for preventing Porsena's army from crossing and invading Rome. By breaking the bridge and stemming the flood, he successfully protected the city (The green, By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood... Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood, While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.).&#10;&#10;Another important event involved the captive maids, led by Cloelia, who escaped from their chains and crossed the Tiber River using the same bridge. This act demonstrated the bravery of Roman women during times of war (The captive maids there tempt the raging tide, Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.).&#10;&#10;Additionally, Manlius, another heroic figure, stood on a rock near the temple and its god to protect it from potential attackers. This high ground provided him with a better vantage point to spot any threats and guard the sacred site (High on a rock heroic Manlius stood...).&#10;&#10;The silver goose, a symbol of protection and national safety in Rome, warned the Romans of an imminent Gallic invasion by cackling. This allowed them to prepare for the attack, ultimately leading to the capture and execution of the Gauls' leader, Catiline (The shining gate There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state. She told the Gauls' approach).&#10;&#10;These events contributed to Rome's defense against Porsena and his army, protecting strategic locations, preventing enemy crossing, providing early warnings of attacks, and ultimately ensuring the safety of the state." />
    <node id="1. Warrior admiring his weapons and armor: The text does not specifically describe a scene where a warrior is admiring his weapons and armor. However, it does mention that Aeneas observes various battles and triumphs of Rome depicted on his shield. This includes images of Roman gods and leaders with their weapons, which could be interpreted as a warrior admiring his armor and weapons in a symbolic sense. The grandeur and significance of these images would highlight the power and glory associated with Roman warfare.&#10;&#10;2. Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she-wolf: According to the narrative, the Sibyl pointed out the Lupercal, a cave located at the foot of Palatine Hill where the she-wolf supposedly nursed Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. This story symbolizes the future greatness of Rome and its divine protection from the gods. The connection between Aeneas' journey and this significant landmark emphasizes the importance of his role in laying the foundation for the Roman Empire, as well as illustrating the connection between the Trojans and their ultimate destiny in Italy." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Vulcan asks his sons to set aside their current tasks and undertake the task of forging a hero's arms that require their strength, skill, and the assistance of Ares (the Greek equivalent of Mars) and Pallas. This task refers to the creation of armor for the hero Aeneas, which will be both labor-intensive and highly skilled work. The shield of Aeneas is specifically mentioned as one of the components of this armor, and it will require a great deal of force, speed, and forming fire from Vulcan and his sons to create. This task is significant because the armor will play a crucial role in Aeneas's ability to defend himself and his people in the impending war with Turnus and his allies." />

    <node id="The Latian coast, led by Turnus, aspired for conquest and claimed a title from the gods and fate. They were preparing for war against the Trojans, which caused Aeneas, the Trojan prince, to worry and experience indecision. Aeneas was contemplating various strategies and their potential outcomes; however, he was unable to find peace or make a decision due to his distress. This situation is likened to a sun or moon's trembling light reflecting on a polished brass surface, casting dubious beams from side to side.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' fears were alleviated when he received divine signs that he interpreted as a call to war and a promise of divine aid from his mother Venus. These signs emboldened Aeneas, and he addressed the Arcadian king, declaring that he was chosen by the heavens for war and must fulfill his destiny.&#10;&#10;In response to the Latian coast's aspiration for conquest, Aeneas initially experienced fear and anxiety; however, with the divine signs and Venus's promise of aid, he ultimately responded with courage and determination, ready to take up arms and defend his people against their enemies." />
    <node id="According to the prophecy of an ancient augur, a foreign leader should lead the combined Lydian and Tuscan troops. The speaker, Aeneas, has responded to this revelation by accepting the challenge of becoming their commander. He interprets these signs as a call to war and a promise of divine aid from his mother Venus, which emboldens him to take up arms and defend the people against their enemies, trusting in the support of the gods. Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, has sent the crown and royal ornaments to Aeneas as a symbol of the Arcadian king's people joining their desire with his. Therefore, Aeneas is willing to fulfill his destiny as the leader of the Lydian and Tuscan troops, as foretold by the ancient augur's prophecy." />
    <node id="In the given text, Vulcan is tasked by his son Aeneas with forging a hero's arms, including the shield of Aeneas, to aid him in the impending war against Turnus and his allies. Vulcan agrees and calls upon his sons to set aside their current tasks and assist him in this labor-intensive and highly skilled work. While Vulcan is eager to fulfill this promise, he is described as trembling from eagerness, indicating his great enthusiasm and commitment to the task at hand.&#10;&#10;As for the promise that Vulcan makes, it is to forge arms for a hero, specifically the Trojan prince Aeneas, using his strength, skill, and the assistance of other gods like Ares (Mars) and Pallas. This promise is significant because the armor will play a crucial role in Aeneas's ability to defend himself and his people in the war against Turnus and his allies. By fulfilling this promise, Vulcan helps ensure that Aeneas is well-equipped to face the challenges of the impending conflict and emerge victorious." />
    <node id="The Salian priests sang of Hercules' legendary exploits, focusing on his battles against numerous monsters and his defiance of Juno and Eurystheus' plots to destroy him. The song began with the tale of Hercules as an infant, when he strangled two serpents with his bare hands while swaddled in bands. As he grew older and stronger, Hercules demolished the walls of Oechalia and Troy.&#10;&#10;The Salian hymn also mentioned the many perils Hercules encountered due to Juno and Eurystheus' hatred. These challenges included battles against cloud-born Centaurs and various monsters. The song celebrated Hercules' unmatched strength, recounting how he overcame the bull and the roaring terror of the forest.&#10;&#10;The Salian priests' account concluded with an emphasis on Hercules' triumphs in his Twelve Labors, which were orchestrated by Eurystheus as part of a plan to destroy him. Despite these efforts, Hercules persevered, showcasing his incredible might and immortalizing his heroic legacy." />

    <node id="The story refers to the monster Cacus, who lived in a cave on what is now the Aventine Hill in Rome. Cacus was more than half beast-like and known for his wickedness. He stole oxen from Evander's people and hid them in his cave, which made it necessary for Hercules (Heracles) to confront and defeat him.&#10;&#10;During one of Hercules' labors, he drove a herd of cattle belonging to Geryon through the countryside after defeating their owner. Cacus, desiring to steal some of these cattle, attached several of them by their tails to the entrance of his cave, so that when Hercules passed by, he would think they had left on their own. Hercules became suspicious and followed the trail of the hidden cattle back to Cacus' lair, where he killed the monster and freed the stolen livestock.&#10;&#10;To commemorate this victory and express gratitude for divine intervention, Evander and his people established an annual vow and ceremony called the Feast of Potitius. This ritual involves sacrificing food and offering drinks to Hercules in honor of his heroic deeds and labors, further strengthening their communal bond and showing reverence to the god they believe has helped them in the past." />
    <node id="In the narrative, old Evander is saying farewell to his departing friend, expressing his wish that he could still possess the strength and youth he had in his prime. He recalls a time when he was able to defeat his enemies and set their shields on fire. Specifically, he mentions Herilus, who was endowed with three lives by Feronia, but Evander defeated him thrice and sent him to the Stygian shore for good.&#10;&#10;Evander wishes that he could defend Pallas and the Tuscan coast from Mezentius, who has been committing atrocities such as rapes and murders in the region. He is filled with grief and worry for his son's safety, and expresses his deep concern by stating that if his son has been doomed to die, he would rather die himself at that very moment.&#10;&#10;Overall, Evander is expressing his desperation and fear in response to the unpunished crimes of Mezentius and the potential danger his son faces. He wishes for restored strength and youth so that he could take action against their enemy and protect those he cares about." />

    <node id="After waking up from his dream and realizing that it was time for dawn, Aeneas took water from Tiber's flood in his hollow palm and prayed to the Laurentian nymphs and Father Tiber, asking for their protection and assistance. He promised to offer them morning songs and evening vows if they were spared from danger. This act demonstrates Aeneas' gratitude and respect for the divine beings associated with the land, as well as his hope for their support in the challenges that lie ahead." />
    <node id="In the narrative provided, Alcides (also known as Hercules) discovered the fraudulent plan of the monster Cacus when he noticed that one of the missing heifers had returned to the cave's entrance after bellowing. This made it clear that the herd's missing members were inside the cave. After finding out about the animals being hidden in the cave, Alcides pursued Cacus by climbing &quot;swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight&quot; to an aerial height. When Alcides approached, Cacus reacted with fear, as evidenced by his trembling and paleness, which indicated that he was aware of the god's approach. The narrative does not describe Cacus as a lion but rather as a monster who possessed a cave and attempted to deceive Alcides by dragging stolen oxen and kine backwards into his cave to conceal their tracks." />
    <node id="The youthful prince, who is unnamed in the given narrative but addressed as &quot;best of the Greeks,&quot; responds to Aeneas' message by expressing his eagerness to help. He is struck with admiration for the Trojan leader and agrees to assist them, claiming that the fame of the Trojans demands it. The youthful prince then welcomes Aeneas and his companions to the Italian shore, promising to accommodate and support them.&#10;&#10;After being welcomed by the youthful prince, Aeneas approaches the king in the Italian territory, addressing him respectfully as &quot;best of the Greeks.&quot; Aeneas begins by explaining his peaceful intentions, stating that he bears olive branches, a symbol of his diplomatic mission. He acknowledges their different origins and the historical conflict between their people but remains undeterred. Aeneas then highlights their shared lineage, tracing both of their ancestries back to Atreus, one of the brother kings from Greek mythology. By emphasizing this connection, Aeneas attempts to create a sense of familiarity and shared identity with the king, despite their differences." />
    <node id="1. Peaceful Sacrifice after War: The peaceful sacrifice at Jove's altar, as described in the excerpt, signifies the resolution of conflict and the establishment of peace between the Sabines and the Romans following the violent war triggered by the abduction of the Sabine women for marriage (the rape of the Sabine dames). This event emphasizes the importance of reconciliation and unity after conflict.&#10;2. Symbolism of Jove's Altar: The sacrifice taking place at Jove's altar highlights the role of divine intervention or approval in sealing the peace agreement between the two groups. It shows that both parties acknowledge the higher power's influence and are willing to abide by its rules, ensuring a stable and long-lasting peace.&#10;3. Punishment of Traitor Metius: The punishment of the traitor Metius, who was dragged along the green by four fiery steeds, serves as a warning against treachery and emphasizes the importance of loyalty in maintaining social order. This severe punishment further strengthens the newfound unity between the Sabines and Romans, ensuring that they can work together towards building a prosperous society.&#10;4. Foreshadowing: The peaceful sacrifice may also foreshadow Aeneas' role as a peacekeeper during his journey to Italy. By observing this religious ceremony, he sets an example of respect for local customs and promotes unity between different groups of people, ultimately paving the way for the establishment of the Roman Empire." />

    <node id="1. The Golden Bough: The Sibyl pointed out the Golden Bough, a sacred branch growing on a tree in the grove of the goddess Diana. This signified that Aeneas must find and pluck this bough as a sign to proceed with his journey to the underworld.&#10;&#10;2. Palatine Hill: The Sibyl pointed out Palatine Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome. It was foretold that Aeneas' destiny was intertwined with this hill, which would later become the site of the great city of Rome.&#10;&#10;3. Lupercal: The Sibyl pointed out the Lupercal, a cave located at the foot of Palatine Hill where the she-wolf supposedly nursed Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. This story symbolizes the future greatness of Rome and its divine protection from the gods.&#10;&#10;4. The Coming Walls of Rome: The Sibyl showed Aeneas the location where the walls of Rome would be built and shared the story of how the Alban Lake once flooded the area. She explained that Jupiter, in order to save Pallanteum (an ancient city on the future site of Rome), ordered Evander to sacrifice a white bull and divert the course of the river. These landmarks and stories highlight the significance of Aeneas' journey and his role in laying the foundation for the Roman Empire, as well as illustrating the connection between the Trojans and their ultimate destiny in Italy." />

The viewer, Aeneas, may not be familiar with all the names, but he can still appreciate the grandeur and significance of the images.&#10;&#10;The shield portrays various battles and triumphs of Rome, including Caesar sitting on his throne, accepting presents vowed for victory. This likely refers to Julius Caesar, who was a famous Roman general and politician before he was assassinated. His adoption of Aeneas' descendants led to the Julian dynasty, which includes Augustus Caesar, who ruled during the time Virgil wrote the Aeneid.&#10;&#10;Another important figure is young Caesar on a ship, leading the Romans and their gods into battle at Actium. This is probably Augustus Caesar, who secured his power by defeating Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium. Agrippa, another significant figure from that battle, is depicted assisting Caesar with propitious (favorable) winds and gods.&#10;&#10;The shield also features personifications of rivers like the Euphrates, Rhine, Danube, and Araxes, symbolizing Rome's future dominion over various lands and peoples. The presence of Cato, a famous Roman statesman known for his moral integrity, implies that Roman values will endure even amidst military conquests.&#10;&#10;Despite the specific names being unknown to Aeneas or the reader, the overall message is clear: Rome's destiny involves triumphing over its enemies and expanding its influence across the world.">

Peaceful Sacrifice after War: The peaceful sacrifice at Jove's altar, as described in the excerpt, signifies the resolution of conflict and the establishment of peace between the Sabines and the Romans following the violent war triggered by the abduction of the Sabine women for marriage (the rape of the Sabine dames). This event emphasizes the importance of reconciliation and unity after conflict.&#10;2. Symbolism of Jove's Altar: The sacrifice taking place at Jove's altar highlights the role of divine intervention or approval in sealing the peace agreement between the two groups. It shows that both parties acknowledge the higher power's influence and are willing to abide by its rules, ensuring a stable and long-lasting peace.&#10;3. Punishment of Traitor Metius: The punishment of the traitor Metius, who was dragged along the green by four fiery steeds, serves as a warning against treachery and emphasizes the importance of loyalty in maintaining social order. This severe punishment further strengthens the newfound unity between the Sabines and Romans, ensuring that they can work together towards building a prosperous society.&#10;4. Foreshadowing: The peaceful sacrifice may also foreshadow Aeneas' role as a peacekeeper during his journey to Italy. By observing this religious ceremony, he sets an example of respect for local customs and promotes unity between different groups of people, ultimately paving the way for the establishment of the Roman Empire.">

He is filled with grief and worry for his son's safety, and expresses his deep concern by stating that if his son has been doomed to die, he would rather die himself at that very moment.&#10;&#10;Overall, Evander is expressing his desperation and fear in response to the unpunished crimes of Mezentius and the potential danger his son faces. He wishes for restored strength and youth so that he could take action against their enemy and protect those he cares about.">

The green: Although not explicitly described, &quot;the green&quot; was likely a location of strategic importance in Rome's defense. It could have been a hill, a field, or any high ground that allowed the Romans to gain an advantageous position against Porsena's army.&#10;&#10;2. A bridge: The bridge referred to here is the Sublician Bridge, which was crucial during this time. Cloelia, a heroic maid who escaped captivity, led other captive maids across the Tiber River by using this bridge. More importantly, Cocles, another heroic figure, broke the bridge and stemmed the flood to prevent Porsena's army from crossing and invading Rome.&#10;&#10;3. A rock: Manlius, a Roman hero, stood on a rock near the temple and the temple's god to protect it from potential attackers. This high ground provided him with a better vantage point to spot any threats and guard the sacred site.&#10;&#10;4. A silver goose: The silver goose was a symbol of protection and national safety in Rome. According to the narrative, it warned the Romans of an imminent Gallic invasion by cackling, which allowed them to prepare for the attack. This event ultimately led to the capture and execution of the Gauls' leader, Catiline.&#10;&#10;In summary, these elements played significant roles in Rome's defense against Porsena and his army. The green (a strategic location), a bridge (preventing enemy crossing), a rock (granting a protective vantage point), and a silver goose (providing early warning of an attack) all contributed to the Romans' ability to protect their city and maintain their independence.">

This suggests that Aeneas is willing to accept the challenges of the impending conflict and is prepared to face them head-on, trusting in the support of the gods.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Aeneas initially experiences fear and anxiety at the prospect of the war being urged by Turnus and his allies, he ultimately responds with courage and determination, ready to take up arms and defend his people against their enemies.">

The destined sacrifices lie drench'd in their gore before each altar.&#10;&#10;In summary, the scene involves Neptune assisting Aeneas' fleet, leading to their successful arrival in Italy and subsequent alliance with the Arcadians.

This allows them to safely reach the Italian coast.&#10;   &#10;2) After their successful arrival, Aeneas and his Trojan companions disembark and prepare to enter into battle with the local Italians who have provoked them with unjust war. Before they do so, they observe a significant event - the Arcadian states paying their offerings in a sacred grove to Hercules (Heracles in Greek mythology).&#10;&#10;3) Seeking refuge and assistance from the Arcadians, the Trojans join this religious ceremony, hoping to establish a connection with them and potentially secure the king's help and protection. This strategy pays off as they are welcomed by the Arcadian king Evander and his people.&#10;&#10;4) Later in the narrative, the shield of Aeneas, created by Vulcan (Hephaestus in Greek mythology) and given to him by his mother Venus (Aphrodite in Greek mythology), features a victorious Caesar sitting on his throne in Rome. He is accepting presents vowed for victory, symbolizing Rome's future dominion over various lands and peoples.&#10;&#10;5) The scene describes the city of Rome filled with three hundred temples, each adorned with spoils and altars. On a sublime throne, Great Caesar presides over sacrifices and offerings given in his honor during a three-day celebration filled with shouts, praise, songs, plays, and flames from numerous altars. The destined sacrifices lie drench'd in their gore before each altar.&#10;&#10;In summary, the scene involves Neptune assisting Aeneas' fleet, leading to their successful arrival in Italy and subsequent alliance with the Arcadians. Later, the shield of Aeneas portrays a victorious Caesar in Rome, sitting on his throne while being honored with temples, altars, and sacrifices during a grand celebration.">

The shield of Aeneas is specifically mentioned as one of the components of this armor, and it will require a great deal of force, speed, and forming fire from Vulcan and his sons to create.

These events include the actions of a guarding hero, a silver goose, and ultimately, the safety of the state.&#10;&#10;First, Cocles, a Roman hero, defended the Sublician Bridge, which was crucial for preventing Porsena's army from crossing and invading Rome. By breaking the bridge and stemming the flood, he successfully protected the city (The green, By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood... Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood, While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.).&#10;&#10;Another important event involved the captive maids, led by Cloelia, who escaped from their chains and crossed the Tiber River using the same bridge. This act demonstrated the bravery of Roman women during times of war (The captive maids there tempt the raging tide, Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.).&#10;&#10;Additionally, Manlius, another heroic figure, stood on a rock near the temple and its god to protect it from potential attackers. This high ground provided him with a better vantage point to spot any threats and guard the sacred site (High on a rock heroic Manlius stood...).&#10;&#10;The silver goose, a symbol of protection and national safety in Rome, warned the Romans of an imminent Gallic invasion by cackling. This allowed them to prepare for the attack, ultimately leading to the capture and execution of the Gauls' leader, Catiline (The shining gate There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state. She told the Gauls' approach).&#10;&#10;These events contributed to Rome's defense against Porsena and his army, protecting strategic locations, preventing enemy crossing, providing early warnings of attacks, and ultimately ensuring the safety of the state.">

The viewer, Aeneas, may not be familiar with all the names, but he can still appreciate the grandeur and significance of the images.&#10;&#10;The shield portrays various battles and triumphs of Rome, including Caesar sitting on his throne, accepting presents vowed for victory. This likely refers to Julius Caesar, who was a famous Roman general and politician before he was assassinated. His adoption of Aeneas' descendants led to the Julian dynasty, which includes Augustus Caesar, who ruled during the time Virgil wrote the Aeneid.&#10;&#10;Another important figure is young Caesar on a ship, leading the Romans and their gods into battle at Actium. This is probably Augustus Caesar, who secured his power by defeating Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium. Agrippa, another significant figure from that battle, is depicted assisting Caesar with propitious (favorable) winds and gods.&#10;&#10;The shield also features personifications of rivers like the Euphrates, Rhine, Danube, and Araxes, symbolizing Rome's future dominion over various lands and peoples. The presence of Cato, a famous Roman statesman known for his moral integrity, implies that Roman values will endure even amidst military conquests.&#10;&#10;Despite the specific names being unknown to Aeneas or the reader, the overall message is clear: Rome's destiny involves triumphing over its enemies and expanding its influence across the world.">

This allows them to safely reach the Italian coast.&#10;   &#10;2) After their successful arrival, Aeneas and his Trojan companions disembark and prepare to enter into battle with the local Italians who have provoked them with unjust war. Before they do so, they observe a significant event - the Arcadian states paying their offerings in a sacred grove to Hercules (Heracles in Greek mythology).&#10;&#10;3) Seeking refuge and assistance from the Arcadians, the Trojans join this religious ceremony, hoping to establish a connection with them and potentially secure the king's help and protection. This strategy pays off as they are welcomed by the Arcadian king Evander and his people.&#10;&#10;4) Later in the narrative, the shield of Aeneas, created by Vulcan (Hephaestus in Greek mythology) and given to him by his mother Venus (Aphrodite in Greek mythology), features a victorious Caesar sitting on his throne in Rome. He is accepting presents vowed for victory, symbolizing Rome's future dominion over various lands and peoples.&#10;&#10;5) The scene describes the city of Rome filled with three hundred temples, each adorned with spoils and altars. On a sublime throne, Great Caesar presides over sacrifices and offerings given in his honor during a three-day celebration filled with shouts, praise, songs, plays, and flames from numerous altars. The destined sacrifices lie drench'd in their gore before each altar.&#10;&#10;In summary, the scene involves Neptune assisting Aeneas' fleet, leading to their successful arrival in Italy and subsequent alliance with the Arcadians. Later, the shield of Aeneas portrays a victorious Caesar in Rome, sitting on his throne while being honored with temples, altars, and sacrifices during a grand celebration.">

However, the arrival of the tyrant Mezentius marked a significant turning point in the town's history.

Cacus, desiring to steal some of these cattle, attached several of them by their tails to the entrance of his cave, so that when Hercules passed by, he would think they had left on their own. Hercules became suspicious and followed the trail of the hidden cattle back to Cacus' lair, where he killed the monster and freed the stolen livestock.&#10;&#10;To commemorate this victory and express gratitude for divine intervention, Evander and his people established an annual vow and ceremony called the Feast of Potitius. This ritual involves sacrificing food and offering drinks to Hercules in honor of his heroic deeds and labors, further strengthening their communal bond and showing reverence to the god they believe has helped them in the past.">

Peaceful Sacrifice after War: The peaceful sacrifice at Jove's altar, as described in the excerpt, signifies the resolution of conflict and the establishment of peace between the Sabines and the Romans following the violent war triggered by the abduction of the Sabine women for marriage (the rape of the Sabine dames). This event emphasizes the importance of reconciliation and unity after conflict.&#10;2. Symbolism of Jove's Altar: The sacrifice taking place at Jove's altar highlights the role of divine intervention or approval in sealing the peace agreement between the two groups. It shows that both parties acknowledge the higher power's influence and are willing to abide by its rules, ensuring a stable and long-lasting peace.&#10;3. Punishment of Traitor Metius: The punishment of the traitor Metius, who was dragged along the green by four fiery steeds, serves as a warning against treachery and emphasizes the importance of loyalty in maintaining social order. This severe punishment further strengthens the newfound unity between the Sabines and Romans, ensuring that they can work together towards building a prosperous society.&#10;4. Foreshadowing: The peaceful sacrifice may also foreshadow Aeneas' role as a peacekeeper during his journey to Italy. By observing this religious ceremony, he sets an example of respect for local customs and promotes unity between different groups of people, ultimately paving the way for the establishment of the Roman Empire.">

The Coming Walls of Rome: The Sibyl showed Aeneas the location where the walls of Rome would be built and shared the story of how the Alban Lake once flooded the area.

However, the arrival of the tyrant Mezentius marked a significant turning point in the town's history.

These crimes brought suffering to the subjects and led to the degeneration of the once-golden age.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide specific details about Caere's founding or the role of the Ausonians and Sicanians in the transformation of the age, but it does mention their presence during this discolored age.

    <edge source="The Salian priests sang of Hercules' legendary exploits, focusing on his battles against numerous monsters and his defiance of Juno and Eurystheus' plots to destroy him. The song began with the tale of Hercules as an infant, when he strangled two serpents with his bare hands while swaddled in bands. As he grew older and stronger, Hercules demolished the walls of Oechalia and Troy.&#10;&#10;The Salian hymn also mentioned the many perils Hercules encountered due to Juno and Eurystheus' hatred.

Despite these efforts, Hercules persevered, showcasing his incredible might and immortalizing his heroic legacy." target="The story refers to the monster Cacus, who lived in a cave on what is now the Aventine Hill in Rome. Cacus was more than half beast-like and known for his wickedness. He stole oxen from Evander's people and hid them in his cave, which made it necessary for Hercules (Heracles) to confront and defeat him.&#10;&#10;During one of Hercules' labors, he drove a herd of cattle belonging to Geryon through the countryside after defeating their owner. Cacus, desiring to steal some of these cattle, attached several of them by their tails to the entrance of his cave, so that when Hercules passed by, he would think they had left on their own. Hercules became suspicious and followed the trail of the hidden cattle back to Cacus' lair, where he killed the monster and freed the stolen livestock.&#10;&#10;To commemorate this victory and express gratitude for divine intervention, Evander and his people established an annual vow and ceremony called the Feast of Potitius. This ritual involves sacrificing food and offering drinks to Hercules in honor of his heroic deeds and labors, further strengthening their communal bond and showing reverence to the god they believe has helped them in the past.">

    <node id="Caroл and her friends, Miss Sherwin and Bea, were having an argument about art. The specific work they were discussing is not mentioned in the text, but it seems that Carol was defending its honesty of observation, while Miss Sherwin argued for sweetness and a cautious use of light. The debate started because Carol found the work to be cynical and not encouraging for day-laborers like herself.&#10;&#10;The conversation about art then evolved into a desire for something more refined in their daily lives, as they expressed their frustration with the mundane nature of Gopher Prairie's social gatherings, which typically revolved around crops and other local concerns. Carol suggested having afternoon tea instead of the usual afternoon coffee as a way to bring some elegance and variety to their routine, which her friends happily agreed to.&#10;&#10;In summary, Caroл and her friends were discussing the merits and shortcomings of an artwork, and this conversation led to them deciding to have afternoon tea in order to enjoy a more sophisticated and delightful social gathering." />

But I can't see any use&#10;in this high-art stuff that doesn't encourage us day-laborers to plod&#10;on.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ensued a fifteen-minute argument about the oldest topic in the world:&#10;It's art but is it pretty? Carol tried to be eloquent regarding honesty&#10;of observation. Miss Sherwin stood out for sweetness and a cautious use&#10;of the uncomfortable properties of light. At the end Carol cried:&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't care how much we disagree. It's a relief to have somebody&#10;talk something besides crops. Let's make Gopher Prairie rock to its&#10;foundations: let's have afternoon tea instead of afternoon coffee.&quot;&#10;&#10;The delighted Bea helped her bring out the ancestral folding&#10;sewing-table, whose yellow and black top was scarred with dotted lines&#10;from a dressmaker's tracing-wheel, and to set it with an embroidered&#10;lunch-cloth, and the mauve-gl" />

Bea&#10;was droll in her attempt to be at once a respectful servant and a bosom&#10;friend. They laughed together over the fact that the stove did not draw,&#10;over the slipperiness of fish in the pan.&#10;&#10;Like a child playing Grandma in a trailing skirt, Carol paraded uptown&#10;for her marketing, crying greetings to housewives along the way.&#10;Everybody bowed to her, strangers and all, and made her feel that they&#10;wanted her, that she belonged here. In city shops she was merely A&#10;Customer--a hat, a voice to bore a harassed clerk. Here she was Mrs. Doc&#10;Kennicott, and her preferences in grape-fruit and manners were known&#10;and remembered and worth discussing . . . even if they" />

Miss Sherwin confided her latest scheme--moral motion&#10;pictures for country districts, with light from a portable dynamo&#10;hitched to a Ford engine. Bea was twice called to fill the hot-water&#10;pitcher and to make cinnamon toast.&#10;&#10;When Kennicott came home at five he tried to be courtly, as befits the&#10;husband of one who has afternoon tea. Carol suggested that Miss Sherwin&#10;stay for supper, and that Kennicott invite Guy Pollock, the much-praised&#10;lawyer, the poetic bachelor.&#10;&#10;Yes, Pollock could come. Yes, he was over the grippe which had prevented&#10;his going to Sam Clark's party.&#10;&#10;Carol regretted her impulse.

They apologized and discussed the afternoon's&#10;game as they passed through the thicket of women's feet. Then they&#10;distributed hot buttered rolls, coffee poured from an enamel-ware pot,&#10;stuffed olives, potato salad, and angel's-food cake. There was, even in&#10;the most strictly conforming Gopher Prairie circles, a certain option&#10;as to collations. The olives need not be stuffed. Doughnuts were in some&#10;houses well thought of as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls.&#10;But there was in all the town no heretic save Carol who omitted&#10;angel's-food.&#10;&#10;They ate enormously. Carol had a suspicion that the thriftier housewives&#10;made the afternoon treat do for evening supper.&#10;&#10;She tried to get back into the current.

I've got the loveliest&#10;new Butterick pattern I want to show you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol crept back to her chair. In the fervor of discussing the game they&#10;ignored her. She was not used to being a wallflower. She struggled to&#10;keep from oversensitiveness, from becoming unpopular by the sure method&#10;of believing that she was unpopular; but she hadn't much reserve of&#10;patience, and at the end of the second game, when Ella Stowbody sniffily&#10;asked her, &quot;Are you going to send to Minneapolis for your dress for&#10;the next soiree--heard you were,&quot; Carol said &quot;Don't know yet&quot; with&#10;unnecessary sharpness.&#10;&#10;She was relieved by the admiration with which the jeune fille Rita&#10;Simons looked at the steel buckles on her pumps; but she resented Mrs.&#10;Howland's tart demand, &quot;Don't you find that new couch of yours is too&#10;broad to be practical?&quot;" />

She had gone to the women at afternoon-coffees, to the merchants&#10;in their stores, with so many outpouring comments and whimsies that&#10;she hadn't given them a chance to betray their opinions of her. The men&#10;smiled--but did they like her? She was lively among the women--but&#10;was she one of them? She could not recall many times when she had been&#10;admitted to the whispering of scandal which is the secret chamber of&#10;Gopher Prairie conversation.&#10;&#10;She was poisoned with doubt, as she drooped up to bed.&#10;&#10;Next day, through her shopping, her mind sat back and observed. Dave&#10;Dyer and Sam Clark were as cordial as she had been fancying; but wasn't&#10;there an impersonal abruptness in the &quot;H' are yuh?&quot; of Chet Dashaway?&#10;Howland the grocer was curt. Was that merely his usual manner?&#10;&#10;&quot;It's infuriating to have to pay attention to what people think. In&#10;St. Paul I didn't care. But here I'm spied on" />
    <node id="The lively, energetic woman with distinct appearances who unexpectedly visited Bea and became the person that the protagonist, Carol, wanted to share her thoughts with is Miss Vida Sherwin.

    <node id="1. Guy Pollock might have chosen to stay in Gopher Prairie due to his lack of ambition or desire for a more exciting or busy life in a bigger city. He may also appreciate the slower pace of life and close-knit community that Gopher Prairie offers.&#10;2. Pollock's quiet demeanor and literary interests could signify that he is an introverted and intellectual person who values knowledge, creativity, and the life of the mind. He may find satisfaction in his work as a lawyer, but also finds solace and enjoyment in his love for literature and the arts. His diffidence in presenting his idols suggests a humility and respect for these figures, and a desire to connect with others who share his interests. Carol's appreciation for his literary nature is part of what draws her to him as a potential friend and kindred spirit." />
    <node id=" of Guy Pollock she&#10;discovered a personality. Pollock was a man of perhaps thirty-eight,&#10;slender, still, deferential. His voice was low. &quot;It was very good of you&#10;to want me,&quot; he said, and he offered no humorous remarks, and did not&#10;ask her if she didn't think Gopher Prairie was &quot;the livest little burg&#10;in the state.&quot;&#10;&#10;She fancied that his even grayness might reveal a thousand tints of&#10;lavender and blue and silver.&#10;&#10;At supper he hinted his love for Sir Thomas Browne, Thoreau, Agnes&#10;Repplier, Arthur Symons, Claude Washburn, Charles Flandrau. He presented&#10;his idols diffidently, but he expanded in Carol's bookishness, in Miss&#10;Sherwin's voluminous praise, in Kennicott's tolerance of any one who&#10;amused his wife.&#10;&#10;Carol wondered why Guy Pollock went on digging at routine law-cases;&#10;why he remained in Gopher Prairie.

She felt triumphant and rather literary. She already&#10;had a Group. It would be only a while now before she provided the town&#10;with fanlights and a knowledge of Galsworthy. She was doing things! As&#10;she served the emergency dessert of cocoanut and sliced oranges, she&#10;cried to Pollock, &quot;Don't you think we ought to get up a dramatic club?&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VI&#10;&#10;&#10;I&#10;&#10;WHEN the first dubious November snow had filtered down, shading with&#10;white the bare clods in the plowed fields, when the first small fire&#10;had been started in the furnace, which is the shrine of a Gopher Prairie&#10;home, Carol began to make the house her own. She dismissed the parlor&#10;furniture--the golden oak table with brass knobs, the moldy brocade&#10;chairs, the picture of &quot;The Doctor.&quot; She went to Minneapolis, to scamper&#10;through department stores and small Tenth Street shops devoted to&#10;ceramics and high thought.

Guy Pollock's discreet brown scarf hung down his back. Young&#10;Rita Simons's net blouse had lost two buttons, and betrayed more of her&#10;delicious plump shoulder than was regarded as pure in Gopher Prairie.&#10;Whether by shock, disgust, joy of combat, or physical activity, all the&#10;party were freed from their years of social decorum. George Edwin Mott&#10;giggled; Luke Dawson twisted his beard; Mrs. Clark insisted, &quot;I did too,&#10;Sam--I got a shoe--I never knew I could fight so terrible!&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol was certain that she was a great reformer.&#10;&#10;She mercifully had combs, mirrors, brushes, needle and thread ready. She&#10;permitted them to restore the divine decency of buttons.&#10;&#10;The grinning Bea brought down-stairs a pile of soft thick sheets of&#10;paper" />
    <node id=" She went to Minneapolis, to scamper&#10;through department stores and small Tenth Street shops devoted to&#10;ceramics and high thought. She had to ship her treasures, but she wanted&#10;to bring them back in her arms.&#10;&#10;Carpenters had torn out the partition between front parlor and back&#10;parlor, thrown it into a long room on which she lavished yellow and&#10;deep blue; a Japanese obi with an intricacy of gold thread on stiff&#10;ultramarine tissue, which she hung as a panel against the maize wall; a&#10;couch with pillows of sapphire velvet and gold bands; chairs which, in&#10;Gopher Prairie, seemed flippant. She hid the sacred family phonograph in&#10;the dining-room, and replaced its stand with a square cabinet on which&#10;was a squat blue jar between yellow candles.&#10;&#10;Kennicott decided against a fireplace. &quot;We'll have a new house in a&#10;couple of years, anyway.&quot;&#10;&#10;She decorated only one room. The rest, Kennicott hinted, she'd better&#10;leave till he &quot;made a ten-strike.&quot;&#10;&#10;The brown cube of a house stirred and awakened; it seemed to be in&#10;motion; it" />
    <node id="During her second shopping tour in Main Street, Carol Kennicott perceives and experiences the town differently than she did during her first. Initially, she noticed the rundown state of the buildings, the dusty shelves, and the unfriendly shopkeepers. However, after deciding to make Gopher Prairie her home and redecorating her house, she becomes more appreciative of the town's simple charm and the kindness of some of the shopkeepers. She no longer focuses on the negative aspects of Main Street and instead enjoys the &quot;homely ease of village life&quot; and the &quot;old men, farmers, and clerks who greeted her politely.&quot;&#10;&#10;This change in perception reflects Carol's changing attitude toward Gopher Prairie. While she initially saw the town as unsophisticated and backward, she now sees it as a place where she can create a fulfilling life for herself. She takes pride in her role as a community organizer, setting up outdoor sports to combat the town's lack of activity due to automobiles and card games. Additionally, she shows excitement over simple things like finding sweetbreads at the local butcher shop, demonstrating her growing appreciation for the town's charms.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's second shopping tour reveals a more positive attitude toward Gopher Prairie, showing that she is beginning to accept and even embrace her new home." />

The lesser sort appeared in&#10;yellow and black dogskin coats, but Kennicott was lordly in a long&#10;raccoon ulster and a new seal cap. When the snow was too deep for his&#10;motor he went off on country calls in a shiny, floral, steel-tipped&#10;cutter, only his ruddy nose and his cigar emerging from the fur.&#10;&#10;Carol herself stirred Main Street by a loose coat of nutria. Her&#10;finger-tips loved the silken fur.&#10;&#10;Her liveliest activity now was organizing outdoor sports in the&#10;motor-paralyzed town.&#10;&#10;The automobile and bridge-whist had not only made more evident the&#10;social divisions in Gopher Prairie but they had also enfeebled the&#10;love of activity. It was so rich" />
    <node id=" end of two&#10;shopping-tours everything had changed proportions. As she never entered&#10;it, the Minniemashie House ceased to exist for her. Clark's Hardware&#10;Store, Dyer's Drug Store, the groceries of Ole Jenson and Frederick&#10;Ludelmeyer and Howland &amp; Gould, the meat markets, the notions&#10;shop--they expanded, and hid all other structures. When she entered Mr.&#10;Ludelmeyer's store and he wheezed, &quot;Goot mornin', Mrs. Kennicott.

When she did contrive to get sweetbreads&#10;at Dahl &amp; Oleson's Meat Market the triumph was so vast that she buzzed&#10;with excitement and admired the strong wise butcher, Mr. Dahl.&#10;&#10;She appreciated the homely ease of village life.

I'll make 'em stop&#10;regarding parties as committee-meetings.&quot;&#10;&#10;Kennicott usually considered himself the master of the house. At his&#10;desire, she went hunting, which was his symbol of happiness, and she&#10;ordered porridge for breakfast, which was his symbol of morality. But&#10;when he came home on the afternoon before the housewarming he found&#10;himself a slave, an intruder, a blunderer. Carol wailed, &quot;Fix the&#10;furnace so you won't have to touch it after supper. And for heaven's&#10;sake take that horrible old door-mat off the porch. And put on your nice&#10;brown and white shirt. Why did you come home so late? Would you" />
    <node id="In the party, Carol Kennicott was the hostess and took charge of all the preparations. She saw to it that everything was in order, from sending orders to Minneapolis for fancy groceries, sewing and pinning patterns, to ensuring that the furnace was fixed and the door-mat removed from the porch. However, despite her efforts to make the party lively and an attack on Gopher Prairie's timidity in pleasure, she found herself feeling like a slave and intruder when her husband came home late on the day of the party.&#10;&#10;After realizing that the guests were hesitant to mingle, Carol took it upon herself to badger some of them into going skiing and bob-sledding. However, she was discouraged when they did not follow through with their promises. Nonetheless, she remained gracious and continued to serve her guests, eventually inviting Guy Pollock, a poetic bachelor, to join them for supper.&#10;&#10;After the party, Carol began to make the house her own by removing the old furniture and going to Minneapolis to buy new ceramics and high-quality items for her home. She also made plans to surprise her husband with an omelet creole for dinner, indicating that she was settling into her role as a wife and homemaker, while still maintaining her individuality and desire to bring some culture and refinement to Gopher Prairie." />
    <node id=" guests liked&#10;the party or not, and a state of satisfied suspense in regard to Bea's&#10;technique in serving, before Kennicott cried from the bay-window in&#10;the living-room, &quot;Here comes somebody!&quot; and Mr. and Mrs. Luke Dawson&#10;faltered in, at a quarter to eight. Then in a shy avalanche arrived&#10;the entire aristocracy of Gopher Prairie: all persons engaged in a&#10;profession, or earning more than twenty-five hundred dollars a year, or&#10;possessed of grandparents born in America.&#10;&#10;Even while they were removing their overshoes they were peeping at the&#10;new decorations. Carol saw Dave Dyer secretively turn over the gold&#10;pillows to find a price-tag, and heard Mr. Julius Flickerbaugh, the&#10;attorney, gasp, &quot;Well, I'll be switched,&quot; as he viewed the vermilion&#10;print hanging against the Japanese obi. She was amused. But her high&#10;spirits slackened as she beheld them form in dress parade, in a long,&#10;silent, uneasy circle clear round the living-room. She felt that she had&#10;been magically whisked back to her first party, at Sam Clark's." />
    <node id="moonlight sliding party, the matrons hesitated to stir away from their&#10;radiators and their daily bridge-whist imitations of the city. She had&#10;to nag them. They scooted down a long hill on a bob-sled, they upset&#10;and got snow down their necks they shrieked that they would do it again&#10;immediately--and they did not do it again at all.&#10;&#10;She badgered another group into going skiing. They shouted and threw&#10;snowballs, and informed her that it was SUCH fun, and they'd have&#10;another skiing expedition right away, and they jollily returned home and&#10;never thereafter left their manuals of bridge.&#10;&#10;Carol was discouraged. She was grateful when Kennicott invited her to&#10;go rabbit-hunting in the woods. She waded down stilly cloisters&#10;between burnt stump and icy oak, through drifts marked with a million&#10;hieroglyphics of rabbit and mouse and bird. She squealed as he leaped&#10;on a pile of brush and fired at the rabbit which ran out. He belonged&#10;there, masculine in reefer and sweater and high-laced boots. That night&#10;she ate prodig" />

The boys wore shoe-packs, blue&#10;flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons, and mackinaws of crimson,&#10;lemon yellow, and foxy brown.&#10;&#10;Carol cried &quot;Fine day!&quot; to the boys; she came in a glow to Howland &amp;&#10;Gould's grocery, her collar white with frost from her breath; she bought&#10;a can of tomatoes as though it were Orient fruit; and returned home&#10;planning to surprise Kennicott with an omelet creole for dinner.&#10;&#10;So brilliant was the snow-glare that when she entered the house she&#10;saw the door-knobs, the newspaper on the table, every white surface as&#10;dazzling mauve, and her head was dizzy in the pyrotechnic dimness. When&#10;her eyes had recovered she felt expanded, drunk with health, mistress of&#10;life. The world was so luminous that she sat down at her rickety little&#10;desk in the living-room to make a poem. (She got no farther than &quot;The&#10;sky is bright, the sun is" />

She emphasizes that existing agencies, such as the Baptist Church, should be worked with and thinks it would be lovely if Carol could teach Sunday School.&#10;3. The character also mentions the importance of personal influence in religious matters and states that she herself doesn't care much for dogma, but does stick firmly to the belief in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man and the leadership of Jesus.&#10;4. It is evident that there is a social pressure for Carol to join the Baptist Church, as her husband was raised in it, and this expectation aligns with certain interpretations of biblical teachings regarding religious unity within marriage." />

    <node id="At a social gathering in Gopher Prairie, the guests have become uninhibited, with torn collars, disheveled hair, and some even losing buttons on their clothing. This behavior indicates that they have been physically active and perhaps engaged in rowdier activities than usual. Carol, who sees herself as a great reformer, takes charge and provides combs, mirrors, brushes, needle, and thread to help the guests restore their appearance and adhere to social decorum once again. The scene suggests a momentary lapse of societal norms, followed by Carol's intervention to restore order, showcasing her role as a caring hostess and community organizer." />

    <node id="The interactions between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering reveal a complex web of relationships with elements of competition, conformity, and tension. The atmosphere is generally polite, yet there are undercurrents of conflict and disagreement that surface throughout their conversations.&#10;&#10;1. Conformity: The women seem to be bound by a strong sense of conformity, as they all partake in the same social gatherings and follow certain rules, such as the way they serve food and discuss their afternoon bridge game. This conformity also extends to their opinions, as seen when Carol tries to introduce a different viewpoint regarding maids but quickly backtracks due to their disapproval.&#10;2. Competition: There is an element of competition between the women, especially when it comes to material possessions and social status. For example, Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow with polished oak doors and beveled plate-glass serves as a symbol of her higher standing in the community.&#10;3. Closed-mindedness: The women generally hold similar views and are quick to reject or criticize those who challenge their perspectives, as seen when Carol raises questions about the treatment of maids. This closed-mindedness suggests that they may not be open to new ideas or different ways of thinking.&#10;4. Fragile relationships: The relationships between the women appear to be somewhat fragile, as they can quickly escalate from lighthearted teasing to harsh criticism and rejection. This is evident when Carol's touchy response to Mrs. Howland leads to a state of &quot;painfully righteous war&quot; that is only resolved by the arrival of food.&#10;5. Exclusivity: The group seems to be exclusive, consisting mainly of married women with their husbands as associate members. This exclusivity may contribute to the tension between the women, as they strive to maintain their status within the group and conform to its expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the relationships between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering are characterized by a mix of conformity, competition, closed-mindedness, fragility, and exclusivity. These factors contribute to an atmosphere that is both polite and tense, with underlying conflicts that can easily escalate when challenged." />

Immediately&#10;she wanted to make peace. She was close to simpering in the sweetness&#10;with which she addressed Mrs Howland: &quot;I think that is the prettiest&#10;display of beef-tea your husband has in his store.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, Gopher Prairie isn't so much behind the times,&quot; gibed Mrs.&#10;Howland. Some one giggled.&#10;&#10;Their rebuffs made her haughty; her haughtiness irritated them to&#10;franker rebuffs; they were working up to a state of painfully righteous&#10;war when they were saved by the coming of food.&#10;&#10;Though Juanita Haydock was highly advanced in the matters of&#10;finger-bowls, doilies, and bath-mats, her &quot;refreshments&quot; were typical&#10;of all the afternoon-coffees.

Then&#10;the town exploded. Only at the annual balls of the Firemen and of the&#10;Eastern Star was there such prodigality of chiffon scarfs and tangoing&#10;and heart-burnings, and these rival institutions were not select--hired&#10;girls attended the Firemen's Ball, with section-hands and laborers. Ella&#10;Stowbody had once gone to a Jolly Seventeen Soiree in the village hack,&#10;hitherto confined to chief mourners at funerals; and Harry Haydock and&#10;Dr. Terry Gould always appeared in the town's only specimens of evening&#10;clothes.&#10;&#10;The afternoon-bridge of the Jolly Seventeen which followed Carol's&#10;lonely doubting was held at Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow,&#10;with its door of polished oak and beveled plate-glass, jar of ferns in&#10;the plastered hall, and in the living-" />

They are known for their efforts in planting trees and running rest-rooms for farmers' wives, as well as their interest in promoting higher cultural standards. This information helps establish the club's role in the community and provides context for why Miss Sherwin thinks Carol should join.&#10;2. The advice given by Miss Sherwin regarding marriage and home life emphasizes the importance of nurturing family relationships and maintaining a welcoming home. She talks about the sacredness of early married life, children, and homemaking, which reflects traditional values and expectations for women during that time period.&#10;3. In this context, Miss Sherwin's suggestion for Carol to work with existing agencies, specifically by teaching Sunday School, can be seen as an attempt to integrate her into the local community and its religious institutions. This aligns with the biblical teachings regarding religious unity within marriage and demonstrates social pressure for Carol to conform to these expectations.&#10;4. Overall, Miss Sherwin's description of the Thanatopsis Club and her advice to Carol reflect the importance of community involvement, family values, and adapting to local traditions in Gopher Prairie." />

Mrs. Bogart also inquires about their church attendance, hoping that they will continue to attend Baptist Church, as her husband was raised a Baptist. Additionally, she expresses her hope that Kennicott won't &quot;drift away from the fold.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bogart's concerns during her visit revolve around the Kennicotts' settling in, their connection to the local church, and maintaining traditional values. As a Good Influence in the neighborhood, she takes an interest in their lives and wants to ensure they are integrating well into the community while upholding conventional beliefs." />
    <node id=" Mrs. Bogart.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bogart lived across the alley from the rear of Carol's house. She&#10;was a widow, and a Prominent Baptist, and a Good Influence. She had so&#10;painfully reared three sons to be Christian gentlemen that one of them&#10;had become an Omaha bartender, one a professor of Greek, and one, Cyrus&#10;N.

The dooryard was of packed yellow clay,&#10;treeless, barren of grass, littered with rusty plowshares and wheels&#10;of discarded cultivators.

It was so rich-looking to sit and drive--and so easy.&#10;Skiing and sliding were &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;old-fashioned.&quot; In fact, the&#10;village longed for the elegance of city recreations almost as much as&#10;the cities longed for village sports; and Gopher Prairie took as&#10;much pride in neglecting coasting as St. Paul--or New York--in going&#10;coasting. Carol did inspire a successful skating-party in mid-November.&#10;Plover Lake glistened in clear sweeps of gray-green ice, ringing to the&#10;skates. On shore the ice-tipped reeds clattered in the wind, and oak&#10;twigs with stubborn last leaves hung against a milky sky.

The stubble was prickly and lined with grass, thistles, and abortive stumps of clover, causing her to drag and flounder as she walked.&#10;&#10;2. Before they returned to the buggy, a significant event occurred when Kennicott shot two prairie chickens. This was significant because it was Carol's first encounter with hunting and death in nature. She had no sensation of blood and described the heaps of feathers as soft and unbruised, without any hint of death. The experience may have been both educational and distressing for her, as she observed Kennicott's actions and the consequences of hunting." />
    <node id="The first farmyard that the characters drive into appears to be quite rustic and unkempt. The house has no porches except for a &quot;low and quite dirty stoop&quot; at the back, and its doors are described as &quot;grime-rubbed.&quot; The barn is crimson with white trimmings, and there is a glazed brick silo, an ex-carriage-shed, an unpainted cow-stable, a chicken-house, a pig-pen, a corn-crib, a granary, and the galvanized-iron skeleton tower of a wind-mill. The dooryard is of packed yellow clay, treeless, and barren of grass, with rusty plowshares and wheels of discarded cultivators scattered about. The pig-pen is filled with hardened trampled mud. However, there is also a surprising splash of color in the form of a clump of scarlet geraniums growing beyond the barn." />

    <node id="Carol's experience at Juanita Haydock's social gathering is one of frustration and disappointment as her attempts to engage the women in outdoor activities and introduce new ideas are met with resistance or indifference. She feels discouraged when her suggestions for skiing and bob-sledding are dismissed, and later on, when she brings up the topic of maids and wages, she faces disapproval from the group. This leads Carol to backtrack and conform to their expectations, making her feel intrusive. Despite these setbacks, Carol remains determined to bring some culture and refinement to Gopher Prairie while also settling into her role as a wife and homemaker.&#10;&#10;Carol feels ignored by the group as they focus on other things, such as crops and local concerns, which she finds mundane compared to her aspirations for more refined and sophisticated social gatherings. Her desire for change is further exemplified when she suggests having afternoon tea instead of the usual afternoon coffee, a proposal that her friends happily agree to but is ultimately unrelated to the main gathering at hand. This reveals Carol's longing for a different kind of social interaction that goes beyond the conventional norms of Gopher Prairie." />
    <node id="Based on the details provided, Kennicott's hunting trip was successful as he was able to shoot a red squirrel and a flight of ducks. The scenery they passed through on their way home further adds to the sense of triumph and enjoyment of the trip. They drove past farms with mounds of straw and wheat-stacks that stood out in startling rose and gold hues, reflecting the sunset's beautiful colors. As the landscape became shrouded in twilight, it transformed into deep reds and browns, exemplifying the picturesque beauty of the prairie.&#10;&#10;The trip also held significance for Carol Milford Kennicott, who was eager to be a part of her husband's world. The experience of following him on the hunting trip allowed her to witness firsthand both the joys and consequences of hunting in this new environment she found herself in as a newlywed." />

Starting her career of reforming: Carol's desire for culture and refinement in Gopher Prairie leads her to take an active role in community organizing, setting up outdoor sports and later becoming involved with the Thanatopsis Club. This can be seen as her way of reforming or improving the town according to her ideals.&#10;&#10;3. Becoming a part of the town: The text suggests that Carol could find fulfillment by participating in church and study-club activities, as well as bridge-parties, which are common social gatherings in Gopher Prairie. By fully immersing herself in these activities, she might feel more connected to the community and find a sense of purpose.&#10;&#10;These options reflect the limited choices available for a woman with a working brain and no work in a small village like Gopher Prairie during the time period described in the text. The focus on traditional roles for women, such as motherhood and homemaking, as well as the lack of employment opportunities and diverse recreational activities, leaves Carol feeling frustrated and seeking alternatives to fulfill her intellectual potential and desire for cultural enrichment." />

However, Kennicott had never thought of giving her an allowance, following the traditional norm where the husband is the primary wage-earner.&#10;&#10;2. Adjusting to a New Role: As a newlywed, Carol was eager to be a part of her husband's world and followed him on the hunting trip. This experience made her realize the realities of their financial situation and the responsibilities that come with managing household finances.&#10;&#10;3. Use of Budget Book: Carol began using a budget-plan account book to manage her finances more effectively. However, this led to self-consciousness as she realized how inexact her finances were and occasionally felt indignant about always having to petition Kennicott for money to buy his food.&#10;&#10;4. Social Expectations: There was a social pressure on Carol to conform to certain religious expectations within her marriage, such as attending the Baptist Church where her husband was raised. This might have added to her financial stress, making her more conscious of her position and role in the marriage. &#10;&#10;In summary, the discrepancy between Carol's expectations and reality, her new experiences and responsibilities as a wife, and social pressures all contributed to Carol becoming self-conscious and indignant about always having to petition her husband for money to buy his food." />

But it was too much trouble&#10;to explain to Kennicott's kindly stubbornness that she was a practical&#10;housekeeper as well as a flighty playmate. She bought a budget-plan&#10;account book and made her budgets as exact as budgets are likely to be&#10;when they lack budgets.&#10;&#10;For the first month it was a honeymoon jest to beg prettily, to confess,&#10;&quot;I haven't a cent in the house, dear,&quot; and to be told, &quot;You're an&#10;extravagant little rabbit.&quot; But the budget book made her realize how&#10;inexact were her finances. She became self-conscious; occasionally she&#10;was indignant that she should always have to petition him for the money&#10;with which to buy his food.

The shells, with their brass caps and sleek&#10;green bodies and hieroglyphics on the wads, were cool and comfortably&#10;heavy in her hands.&#10;&#10;Kennicott wore a brown canvas hunting-coat with vast pockets lining&#10;the inside, corduroy trousers which bulged at the wrinkles, peeled and&#10;scarred shoes, a scarecrow felt hat. In this uniform he felt virile.&#10;They clumped out to the livery buggy, they packed the kit and the box of&#10;lunch into the back, crying to each other that it was a magnificent day.&#10;&#10;Kennicott had borrowed Jackson Elder's red and white English setter, a&#10;complacent dog with a waving tail of silver hair which flickered in the&#10;sunshine. As they started, the dog yelped, and leaped at the horses'&#10;heads, till Kennicott took him into the buggy, where he nuzzled Carol's&#10;knees and leaned out to sneer at farm mongrels.&#10;&#10;The grays clattered out on the hard dirt road with a pleasant song of&#10;hoof" />
    <node id="In Gopher Prairie, the traditional afternoon treat distribution typically involved serving coffee. Carol, wanting to bring some elegance and variety to their routine, suggested having afternoon tea instead. This was an attempt to make the social gatherings more refined and sophisticated, as she found the usual conversations revolving around crops and local concerns mundane compared to her aspirations.&#10;&#10;During the gathering where this change occurred, Carol tried to fit in by taking charge and providing combs, mirrors, brushes, needle, and thread to help the guests restore their appearance after a momentary lapse of societal norms.

They were already playing.&#10;Despite her flabby resolves she had not yet learned bridge. She was&#10;winningly apologetic about it to Juanita, and ashamed that she should&#10;have to go on being apologetic.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dave Dyer, a sallow woman with a thin prettiness devoted to&#10;experiments in religious cults, illnesses, and scandal-bearing, shook&#10;her finger at Carol and trilled, &quot;You're a naughty one! I don't believe&#10;you appreciate the honor, when you got into the Jolly Seventeen so&#10;easy!&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Chet Dashaway nudged her neighbor at the second table.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, there is no direct description of the townspeople of Gopher Prairie preparing for the winter season. However, it is mentioned that Carol had been trying to encourage the women in Gopher Prairie to participate in outdoor activities, which could include winter sports or preparations.&#10;&#10;Regarding the Kennicott family, they seem to be spending their time adjusting to their new life together. After her marriage, Carol focuses on being a housewife and taking pride in her new home. She had also joined her husband, Dr. Will Kennicott, on a hunting trip, allowing her to become more familiar with his world.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the text highlights that Carol is trying to bring some culture and refinement to Gopher Prairie by setting up outdoor sports and settling into her role as a wife and homemaker. As for Dr. Kennicott, he is one of the most popular physicians in town, having recently returned from an extended honeymoon tour with his new bride.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there are no specific details about the townspeople preparing for winter, the Kennicotts are spending their time adjusting to married life and settling into their new home." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Mrs. Bogart pays a visit to the Kennicott household, expressing curiosity and concern about their recent refurnishing. She compliments the new furniture, especially the blue chairs, and asks how much the big chair cost. Through these actions, she subtly conveys her opinions on the Kennicotts' lifestyle by showing interest in their belongings and finances.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bogart is described as a Prominent Baptist and a Good Influence in the neighborhood. She takes an interest in the lives of those around her, hoping to ensure they are integrating well into the community while upholding conventional beliefs. During her visit to the Kennicotts, she expresses hope that they will continue to attend Baptist Church and conveys her concern about Kennicott potentially drifting away from traditional religious values.&#10;&#10;The narrative further reveals that Mrs. Bogart had been observing the Kennicotts' house from across the alley, watching as they settled in. Once she feels it is appropriate, she pays a visit to welcome them and offer support while subtly expressing her opinions about their new lifestyle." />
    <node id="Carol's experience accompanying Kennicott on a bird-hunting trip in the west forty of Pete Rustad's farm is one of immersion into an unfamiliar environment and situation. She has no desire to kill birds but wants to be a part of her husband's world, so she joins him despite her apprehensions.&#10;&#10;The terrain proves challenging for Carol, as she is used to pavement and finds the stubble, grass, thistles, and abortive stumps difficult to navigate. Nevertheless, she persists and follows the dog and Kennicott across fields and hills.&#10;&#10;During their expedition, Kennicott shoots two prairie chickens, an event that is significant for Carol as it is her first exposure to hunting and death in nature. She describes the heaps of feathers as soft and unbruised, without any hint of death – indicating both curiosity and potential distress at this new experience.&#10;&#10;Despite the hunting aspect, Carol appears to find joy in other elements of the trip. She examines the gun with interest, noticing its smooth stock and carved hard rubber butt, finding comfort in the weight of the shells in her hands. The beautiful sunset, with its rose and gold hues, further adds to the pleasure of the outing.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's experience is a mix of unease, fascination, and longing for connection as she explores this new aspect of life on the prairie with her husband." />
    <node id="The woman, Carol Milford Kennicott, faced challenges while following the dog due to the unfamiliar terrain, which was lumpy and uncomfortable for her feet that were trained on pavement. The stubble was prickly and lined with grass, thistles, and abortive stumps of clover, causing her to drag and flounder as she walked.&#10;&#10;When they came across some gray birds, Kennicott shot two prairie chickens, which was significant for Carol because it was her first encounter with hunting and death in nature. She had no sensation of blood, and the heaps of feathers were soft and unbruised, without any hint of death. The experience may have been both educational and distressing for her as she observed Kennicott's actions and the consequences of hunting." />

The atmosphere is generally polite, yet there are undercurrents of conflict and disagreement that surface throughout their conversations.&#10;&#10;1. Conformity: The women seem to be bound by a strong sense of conformity, as they all partake in the same social gatherings and follow certain rules, such as the way they serve food and discuss their afternoon bridge game. This conformity also extends to their opinions, as seen when Carol tries to introduce a different viewpoint regarding maids but quickly backtracks due to their disapproval.&#10;2. Competition: There is an element of competition between the women, especially when it comes to material possessions and social status. For example, Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow with polished oak doors and beveled plate-glass serves as a symbol of her higher standing in the community.&#10;3. Closed-mindedness: The women generally hold similar views and are quick to reject or criticize those who challenge their perspectives, as seen when Carol raises questions about the treatment of maids. This closed-mindedness suggests that they may not be open to new ideas or different ways of thinking.&#10;4. Fragile relationships: The relationships between the women appear to be somewhat fragile, as they can quickly escalate from lighthearted teasing to harsh criticism and rejection. This is evident when Carol's touchy response to Mrs. Howland leads to a state of &quot;painfully righteous war&quot; that is only resolved by the arrival of food.&#10;5. Exclusivity: The group seems to be exclusive, consisting mainly of married women with their husbands as associate members. This exclusivity may contribute to the tension between the women, as they strive to maintain their status within the group and conform to its expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the relationships between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering are characterized by a mix of conformity, competition, closed-mindedness, fragility, and exclusivity. These factors contribute to an atmosphere that is both polite and tense, with underlying conflicts that can easily escalate when challenged.">

The debate started because Carol found the work to be cynical and not encouraging for day-laborers like herself.&#10;&#10;The conversation about art then evolved into a desire for something more refined in their daily lives, as they expressed their frustration with the mundane nature of Gopher Prairie's social gatherings, which typically revolved around crops and other local concerns.

Carol, wanting to bring some elegance and variety to their routine, suggested having afternoon tea instead. This was an attempt to make the social gatherings more refined and sophisticated, as she found the usual conversations revolving around crops and local concerns mundane compared to her aspirations.&#10;&#10;During the gathering where this change occurred, Carol tried to fit in by taking charge and providing combs, mirrors, brushes, needle, and thread to help the guests restore their appearance after a momentary lapse of societal norms. This action showcased her role as a caring hostess and community organizer, further illustrating her desire to be a part of the town's social fabric while also introducing new ideas and refinements.">

The novel &quot;The Damnation of Theron Ware,&quot; published in 1896, tells the story of a small-town minister who is corrupted by the big city's intellectualism and secularism. It is considered a classic of American literature and explores themes of religion, morality, and ambition. However, it seems that Carol's perspective on the book aligns with her belief in the importance of art as a force for good and its potential to inspire and uplift people.">

The atmosphere is generally polite, yet there are undercurrents of conflict and disagreement that surface throughout their conversations.&#10;&#10;1. Conformity: The women seem to be bound by a strong sense of conformity, as they all partake in the same social gatherings and follow certain rules, such as the way they serve food and discuss their afternoon bridge game. This conformity also extends to their opinions, as seen when Carol tries to introduce a different viewpoint regarding maids but quickly backtracks due to their disapproval.&#10;2. Competition: There is an element of competition between the women, especially when it comes to material possessions and social status. For example, Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow with polished oak doors and beveled plate-glass serves as a symbol of her higher standing in the community.&#10;3. Closed-mindedness: The women generally hold similar views and are quick to reject or criticize those who challenge their perspectives, as seen when Carol raises questions about the treatment of maids. This closed-mindedness suggests that they may not be open to new ideas or different ways of thinking.&#10;4. Fragile relationships: The relationships between the women appear to be somewhat fragile, as they can quickly escalate from lighthearted teasing to harsh criticism and rejection. This is evident when Carol's touchy response to Mrs. Howland leads to a state of &quot;painfully righteous war&quot; that is only resolved by the arrival of food.&#10;5. Exclusivity: The group seems to be exclusive, consisting mainly of married women with their husbands as associate members. This exclusivity may contribute to the tension between the women, as they strive to maintain their status within the group and conform to its expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the relationships between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering are characterized by a mix of conformity, competition, closed-mindedness, fragility, and exclusivity. These factors contribute to an atmosphere that is both polite and tense, with underlying conflicts that can easily escalate when challenged.">

However, people are drawn to her electric activity which veils her physical appearance. She is described as being energetic as a chipmunk with fingers that flutter and sympathy that comes out in spurts." target="1. The description of the Thanatopsis Club given by Miss Sherwin highlights its focus on social work, culture, and refinement. They are known for their efforts in planting trees and running rest-rooms for farmers' wives, as well as their interest in promoting higher cultural standards. This information helps establish the club's role in the community and provides context for why Miss Sherwin thinks Carol should join.&#10;2. The advice given by Miss Sherwin regarding marriage and home life emphasizes the importance of nurturing family relationships and maintaining a welcoming home. She talks about the sacredness of early married life, children, and homemaking, which reflects traditional values and expectations for women during that time period.&#10;3. In this context, Miss Sherwin's suggestion for Carol to work with existing agencies, specifically by teaching Sunday School, can be seen as an attempt to integrate her into the local community and its religious institutions. This aligns with the biblical teachings regarding religious unity within marriage and demonstrates social pressure for Carol to conform to these expectations.&#10;4. Overall, Miss Sherwin's description of the Thanatopsis Club and her advice to Carol reflect the importance of community involvement, family values, and adapting to local traditions in Gopher Prairie.">

The atmosphere is generally polite, yet there are undercurrents of conflict and disagreement that surface throughout their conversations.&#10;&#10;1. Conformity: The women seem to be bound by a strong sense of conformity, as they all partake in the same social gatherings and follow certain rules, such as the way they serve food and discuss their afternoon bridge game. This conformity also extends to their opinions, as seen when Carol tries to introduce a different viewpoint regarding maids but quickly backtracks due to their disapproval.&#10;2. Competition: There is an element of competition between the women, especially when it comes to material possessions and social status. For example, Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow with polished oak doors and beveled plate-glass serves as a symbol of her higher standing in the community.&#10;3. Closed-mindedness: The women generally hold similar views and are quick to reject or criticize those who challenge their perspectives, as seen when Carol raises questions about the treatment of maids. This closed-mindedness suggests that they may not be open to new ideas or different ways of thinking.&#10;4. Fragile relationships: The relationships between the women appear to be somewhat fragile, as they can quickly escalate from lighthearted teasing to harsh criticism and rejection. This is evident when Carol's touchy response to Mrs. Howland leads to a state of &quot;painfully righteous war&quot; that is only resolved by the arrival of food.&#10;5. Exclusivity: The group seems to be exclusive, consisting mainly of married women with their husbands as associate members. This exclusivity may contribute to the tension between the women, as they strive to maintain their status within the group and conform to its expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the relationships between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering are characterized by a mix of conformity, competition, closed-mindedness, fragility, and exclusivity. These factors contribute to an atmosphere that is both polite and tense, with underlying conflicts that can easily escalate when challenged.">

The description of the Thanatopsis Club given by Miss Sherwin highlights its focus on social work, culture, and refinement. They are known for their efforts in planting trees and running rest-rooms for farmers' wives, as well as their interest in promoting higher cultural standards. This information helps establish the club's role in the community and provides context for why Miss Sherwin thinks Carol should join.&#10;2. The advice given by Miss Sherwin regarding marriage and home life emphasizes the importance of nurturing family relationships and maintaining a welcoming home. She talks about the sacredness of early married life, children, and homemaking, which reflects traditional values and expectations for women during that time period.&#10;3. In this context, Miss Sherwin's suggestion for Carol to work with existing agencies, specifically by teaching Sunday School, can be seen as an attempt to integrate her into the local community and its religious institutions. This aligns with the biblical teachings regarding religious unity within marriage and demonstrates social pressure for Carol to conform to these expectations.&#10;4. Overall, Miss Sherwin's description of the Thanatopsis Club and her advice to Carol reflect the importance of community involvement, family values, and adapting to local traditions in Gopher Prairie.">

    <edge source="The interactions between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering reveal a complex web of relationships with elements of competition, conformity, and tension. The atmosphere is generally polite, yet there are undercurrents of conflict and disagreement that surface throughout their conversations.&#10;&#10;1. Conformity: The women seem to be bound by a strong sense of conformity, as they all partake in the same social gatherings and follow certain rules, such as the way they serve food and discuss their afternoon bridge game. This conformity also extends to their opinions, as seen when Carol tries to introduce a different viewpoint regarding maids but quickly backtracks due to their disapproval.&#10;2. Competition: There is an element of competition between the women, especially when it comes to material possessions and social status. For example, Juanita Haydock's new concrete bungalow with polished oak doors and beveled plate-glass serves as a symbol of her higher standing in the community.&#10;3. Closed-mindedness: The women generally hold similar views and are quick to reject or criticize those who challenge their perspectives, as seen when Carol raises questions about the treatment of maids. This closed-mindedness suggests that they may not be open to new ideas or different ways of thinking.&#10;4. Fragile relationships: The relationships between the women appear to be somewhat fragile, as they can quickly escalate from lighthearted teasing to harsh criticism and rejection. This is evident when Carol's touchy response to Mrs. Howland leads to a state of &quot;painfully righteous war&quot; that is only resolved by the arrival of food.&#10;5. Exclusivity: The group seems to be exclusive, consisting mainly of married women with their husbands as associate members. This exclusivity may contribute to the tension between the women, as they strive to maintain their status within the group and conform to its expectations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the relationships between the women at Juanita Haydock's gathering are characterized by a mix of conformity, competition, closed-mindedness, fragility, and exclusivity.

She feels discouraged when her suggestions for skiing and bob-sledding are dismissed, and later on, when she brings up the topic of maids and wages, she faces disapproval from the group. This leads Carol to backtrack and conform to their expectations, making her feel intrusive. Despite these setbacks, Carol remains determined to bring some culture and refinement to Gopher Prairie while also settling into her role as a wife and homemaker.&#10;&#10;Carol feels ignored by the group as they focus on other things, such as crops and local concerns, which she finds mundane compared to her aspirations for more refined and sophisticated social gatherings. Her desire for change is further exemplified when she suggests having afternoon tea instead of the usual afternoon coffee, a proposal that her friends happily agree to but is ultimately unrelated to the main gathering at hand. This reveals Carol's longing for a different kind of social interaction that goes beyond the conventional norms of Gopher Prairie.">

He leaped&#10;from the buggy, twisted the reins about the whip-socket, swung her out,&#10;caught up his gun, slipped in two shells, stalked toward the rigid dog,&#10;Carol pattering after him. The setter crawled ahead, his tail quivering,&#10;his belly close to the stubble. Carol was nervous. She expected clouds&#10;of large birds to fly up instantly.

The novel &quot;The Damnation of Theron Ware,&quot; published in 1896, tells the story of a small-town minister who is corrupted by the big city's intellectualism and secularism. It is considered a classic of American literature and explores themes of religion, morality, and ambition. However, it seems that Carol's perspective on the book aligns with her belief in the importance of art as a force for good and its potential to inspire and uplift people.">

Different Expectations: Carol had expected to have an allowance and be business-like in their marriage, as she had asserted to her fellow librarians. However, Kennicott had never thought of giving her an allowance, following the traditional norm where the husband is the primary wage-earner.&#10;&#10;2. Adjusting to a New Role: As a newlywed, Carol was eager to be a part of her husband's world and followed him on the hunting trip. This experience made her realize the realities of their financial situation and the responsibilities that come with managing household finances.&#10;&#10;3. Use of Budget Book: Carol began using a budget-plan account book to manage her finances more effectively. However, this led to self-consciousness as she realized how inexact her finances were and occasionally felt indignant about always having to petition Kennicott for money to buy his food.&#10;&#10;4. Social Expectations: There was a social pressure on Carol to conform to certain religious expectations within her marriage, such as attending the Baptist Church where her husband was raised. This might have added to her financial stress, making her more conscious of her position and role in the marriage. &#10;&#10;In summary, the discrepancy between Carol's expectations and reality, her new experiences and responsibilities as a wife, and social pressures all contributed to Carol becoming self-conscious and indignant about always having to petition her husband for money to buy his food.">

    <node id="The two ladies can be distinguished by their hair color and style. Mary has pale brown hair that is parted and braided smoothly, while Diana has duskier tresses that cover her neck with thick curls. The narrator feels more wretched and desperate about her own situation in contrast to the two ladies because she sees them as having a comfortable and distinguished appearance, while she is in a state of destitution and desperation, seeking employment and shelter. She perceives it as impossible to receive any concern from the inhabitants of this house due to her status as a stranger and her lack of acquaintances in the area." />
    <node id=" thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for&#10;such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair&#10;complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction&#10;and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the&#10;other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's&#10;pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses&#10;covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ye'll want your supper, I am sure,&quot; observed Hannah; &quot;and so will Mr.&#10;St. John when he comes in.&quot;&#10;&#10;And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed&#10;about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent&#10;on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so&#10;keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it&#10;recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from&#10;contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this&#10;house with concern on my behalf;" />
    <node id="&#10;resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the&#10;top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and&#10;brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach&#10;the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it&#10;possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?&#10;Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman&#10;opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless&#10;heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked&#10;if a servant was wanted here?&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said she; &quot;we do not keep a servant.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?&quot; I continued.&#10;&quot;I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:&#10;no matter what.&quot;&#10;&#10;But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:&#10;besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,&#10;position, tale.  She" />
    <node id=" strength, I pushed on.  I reached the&#10;house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was&#10;this the parsonage?&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Was the clergyman in?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Would he be in soon?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, he was gone from home.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To a distance?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden&#10;death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay&#10;there a fortnight longer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Was there any lady of the house?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;&quot; and of her,&#10;reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was&#10;sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.&#10;&#10;Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of&#10;bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to&#10;allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to" />
    <node id=" much at first--restrain her,&quot; said the brother; &quot;she has had&#10;enough.&quot;  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.&#10;&#10;&quot;A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her&#10;name.&quot;&#10;&#10;I felt I could speak, and I answered--&quot;My name is Jane Elliott.&quot;  Anxious&#10;as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.&#10;&#10;&quot;And where do you live?  Where are your friends?&quot;&#10;&#10;I was silent.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can we send for any one you know?&quot;&#10;&#10;I shook my head.&#10;&#10;&quot;What account can you give of yourself?&quot;&#10;&#10;Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and&#10;once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,&#10;vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the&#10;mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more&#10;to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account" />
    <node id=" desperate than ever, it seemed from&#10;contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this&#10;house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my&#10;wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As&#10;I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last&#10;idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you want?&quot; she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed&#10;me by the light of the candle she held.&#10;&#10;&quot;May I speak to your mistresses?&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come&#10;from?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a stranger.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What is your business here at this hour?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of&#10;bread to eat.&quot;&#10;&#10;Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  &quot;I'll&#10;give you a piece of bread,&quot; she said, after a pause; &quot;but we can't take&#10;" />
    <node id=" into the&#10;house.&quot;&#10;&#10;{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}&#10;&#10;With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,&#10;bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an&#10;aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two&#10;ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at&#10;me.&#10;&#10;&quot;St. John, who is it?&quot; I heard one ask.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot tell: I found her at the door,&quot; was the reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;She does look white,&quot; said Hannah.&#10;&#10;&quot;As white as clay or death,&quot; was responded.  &quot;She will fall: let her&#10;sit.&quot;&#10;&#10;And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still&#10;possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she&#10;is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The narrative describes the protagonist's struggle with poverty and hunger, which led her to enter a shop to ask for charity. However, when she actually tried to make the request, she found herself unable to do so due to shame and a feeling of absurdity. Instead, she asked the shopkeeper if she knew of any dressmaker in the village. This change in behavior can be attributed to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Social conditioning: The protagonist comes from a respectable background, as evidenced by her clothing and manners. She is not used to begging for charity and finds it difficult to deviate from societal norms. Asking for work or information about dressmakers is more in line with her social status and upbringing.&#10;2. Pride: The protagonist values her self-respect and dignity. Begging for food or money directly would make her feel vulnerable and humiliated. By asking for work or information, she maintains a sense of control over her situation and preserves her dignity.&#10;3. Uncertainty: The protagonist is unsure whether the shopkeeper will accept her request for charity. She may fear rejection or ridicule. Asking for work or information is a safer option since it is less likely to elicit negative emotions from the shopkeeper.&#10;4. Desire for self-sufficiency: The protagonist wants to earn her own living rather than rely on charity. By asking for work, she shows her determination to be self-reliant and independent, even in the face of adversity.&#10;5. Fear of suspicion: The protagonist is aware that her well-dressed appearance may arouse suspicion among the villagers. By asking for work or information, she hopes to dispel any doubts about her intentions and motivations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the protagonist's struggle to ask for charity reflects her complex emotions and social conditioning. She wants to maintain her dignity, self-respect, and independence while also addressing her immediate needs for food and shelter." />
    <node id=" for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk&#10;handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell&#10;how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not&#10;know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they&#10;would not; but I must try.&#10;&#10;I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed&#10;person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How&#10;could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter&#10;the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,&#10;the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only&#10;begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in&#10;the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She&#10;pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but&#10;conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained&#10;it.  Soon I asked her &quot;if there were any dressmaker" />
    <node id=" Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to&#10;allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the&#10;village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were&#10;there besides the woman I ventured the request--&quot;Would she give me a roll&#10;for this handkerchief?&quot;&#10;&#10;She looked at me with evident suspicion: &quot;Nay, she never sold stuff i'&#10;that way.&quot;&#10;&#10;Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  &quot;How could&#10;she tell where I had got the handkerchief?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Would she take my gloves?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No! what could she do with them?&quot;&#10;&#10;Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is&#10;enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I&#10;can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral&#10;degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a&#10;recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who&#10;repulsed me.  I felt it was what was" />
    <node id=" a&#10;recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who&#10;repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not&#10;be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a&#10;well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was&#10;employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,&#10;certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who&#10;knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take&#10;my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the&#10;offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me&#10;condense now.  I am sick of the subject.&#10;&#10;A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the&#10;farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and&#10;said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.&quot;  He cast on me&#10;a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from" />
    <node id=" weep; but&#10;conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained&#10;it.  Soon I asked her &quot;if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in&#10;the village?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for.&quot;&#10;&#10;I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face&#10;with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,&#10;without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must&#10;apply somewhere.  Where?&#10;&#10;&quot;Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was&#10;wanted?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay; she couldn't say.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people&#10;do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's&#10;needle-factory, and at the foundry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did Mr. Oliver employ women?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay; it was men's work.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what do the women do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I knawn't,&quot; was the answer." />
    <node id=" a warm, dry bed received me.  I&#10;thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful&#10;joy--and slept.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The protagonist, Jane Eyre, took several actions the night she decided to leave Thornfield Hall. She gathered some personal items, including a parcel of clothing, a locket, a ring, and twenty shillings from her purse. She also encountered a pearl necklace given to her by Mr. Rochester but left it behind, considering it not hers. She whispered goodbye to Mrs. Fairfax and Adele as she passed their rooms and made her way downstairs. Jane oiled the key and lock of the side-door in the kitchen, got water and bread, and then left Thornfield Hall through a small wicket gate in the larger gates.&#10;&#10;As she departed, Jane felt kindly toward Mrs. Fairfax and Adele. She appreciated their company and had spent many pleasant moments with them. Jane even reminisced about observing Adele playing in the gallery while Jane herself was lost in reverie; she noted that her thoughts were not dark but filled with hope and ideals. Despite her affection for Mrs. Fairfax and Adele, Jane understood the necessity of leaving Thornfield Hall to escape the haunting presence of Mr. Rochester's first wife." />
    <node id=" and associations,&#10;there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean&#10;to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of&#10;Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent&#10;vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open&#10;sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion&#10;of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was&#10;wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was&#10;haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all&#10;knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never&#10;would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was&#10;housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac&#10;elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more&#10;retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely&#10;enough," />
    <node id=" was yet&#10;night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  &quot;It&#10;cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,&quot; thought I.  I&#10;rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew&#10;where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking&#10;these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester&#10;had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it&#10;was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I&#10;made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I&#10;had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,&#10;took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole&#10;from my room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!&quot; I whispered, as I glided past her door.&#10;&quot;Farewell, my darling Adele!&quot; I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.&#10;No thought could be admitted of entering" />
    <node id=" come home that&#10;night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or&#10;watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-&#10;hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I&#10;recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door&#10;was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward&#10;attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but&#10;you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and&#10;amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once&#10;into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now&#10;and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling&#10;snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and&#10;dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a&#10;pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in&#10;your aspect, which told of no bitter," />
    <node id=" the morning; I should be gone.  He&#10;would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his&#10;love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of&#10;this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided&#10;on.&#10;&#10;Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it&#10;mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I&#10;sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.&#10;I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk&#10;far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All&#10;this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it&#10;softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and&#10;locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I&#10;departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.&#10;&#10;A mile" />
    <node id=" visions were not dark: there was a&#10;pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in&#10;your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:&#10;your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit&#10;follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.&#10;The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened&#10;you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was&#10;much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of&#10;your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very&#10;well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy&#10;sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly&#10;aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather&#10;black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.&#10;Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or&#10;something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting&#10;out of" />
    <node id=", &quot;did you do when you had&#10;settled her here?  Where did you go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.&#10;Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the&#10;March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its&#10;lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent&#10;woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you could not marry, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not&#10;my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to&#10;tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me&#10;so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be&#10;loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to&#10;understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was&#10;burdened.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me" />
    <node id="Sure, I'd be happy to explain. My family history is quite complicated, as is my marriage situation. I was not my father's eldest son, and he was an avaricious and grasping man who wanted to keep the property intact. He had made plans for me to marry a wealthy woman, Mr. Mason's daughter, who had a fortune of thirty thousand pounds. This was kept concealed from me, and I only learned about it after I had already married Bertha Mason.&#10;&#10;My father and my brother Rowland were aware of Mr. Mason's wealth, but they did not care about his daughter's character or her compatibility with me. They were only interested in the thirty thousand pounds. When I left college, I was sent to Jamaica to marry Bertha. However, I soon discovered that she had an alien nature, and our tastes were obnoxious to each other. Her cast of mind was common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher or expanded to anything larger.&#10;&#10;Regarding my relationship with my brother, we are not close because he was part of the conspiracy to keep me in the dark about Bertha's true character, and her father's wealth was the only thing that mattered to him. My father's avarice and his desire to keep the property together also played a significant role in my family relationships. He wanted to provide for me by having me marry a wealthy woman, but he did not care about my happiness or well-being." />
    <node id=" me!&quot; burst involuntarily from my lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a fool!&quot; cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  &quot;I keep telling her I am&#10;not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing&#10;of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my&#10;infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in&#10;opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,&#10;Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove&#10;you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the&#10;case.  Can you listen to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; for hours if you will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the&#10;eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have understood something to that effect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane," />
    <node id="  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on&#10;me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me&#10;through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man&#10;bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my&#10;father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a&#10;nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with&#10;mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not&#10;rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered&#10;that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs&#10;of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost&#10;sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,&#10;which one is justified in hurling back in the" />

I&#10;must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner&#10;betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old&#10;acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made&#10;inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned&#10;from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty&#10;thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to&#10;Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said&#10;nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of&#10;Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no" />

My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;&#10;but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the&#10;plot against me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of&#10;concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,&#10;even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious&#10;to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of&#10;being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found&#10;that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day&#10;with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained&#10;between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from&#10;her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I&#10;perceived that I should never have a" />

You open your&#10;eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,&#10;as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted&#10;to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you&#10;mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;&#10;and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I&#10;don't very well know why.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean,--What next?

    <node id="The narrator is prevented from getting the relief they need because of their own pride and inability to ask directly for help. When the clergyman is reported to be away and there is no lady of the house, the narrator feels that they have no claim or right to ask for assistance from the inhabitants of the house. This is due to their status as a stranger and their lack of acquaintances in the area. The narrator also mentions the negative perception of beggars, making it difficult for them to ask for help without appearing suspicious. Additionally, the narrator feels morally degraded and physically suffering, making it hard for them to bring themselves to beg for relief." />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I&#10;wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to&#10;ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the&#10;afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving&#10;dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened&#10;towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a&#10;well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I&#10;remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no&#10;friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for&#10;introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least&#10;with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have&#10;something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,&#10;and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the&#10;house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was&#10;this" />
    <node id="The distant light seen in the marshes is most likely a candle in a house. The narrator observes that the light does not advance, recede, spread, or diminish, which suggests that it is coming from a stationary source within a building. However, the narrator also concludes that the light is too far away to reach, implying that it is situated at a significant distance from her current location. This, combined with the fact that the light appears to be shining through the rain and mist, suggests that it is coming from a window in a house located somewhere within the marshlands. The narrator is unable to determine exactly where the house is or how to reach it, but she continues to walk toward the light, hoping that it might offer her some refuge from the storm and the desolation of the moors." />

Dark as it was getting, I could&#10;still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and&#10;shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.&#10;&#10;My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,&#10;vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among&#10;the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  &quot;That is an _ignis&#10;fatuus_,&quot; was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It&#10;burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  &quot;Is&#10;it, then, a bonfire just kindled?&quot; I questioned.  I watched to see&#10;whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not&#10;enlarge.  &quot;It may be a candle in a house,&quot; I then conjectured; &quot;but if&#10;so, I can never reach it.

I lay&#10;still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died&#10;moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the&#10;skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly&#10;numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;&#10;but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere&#10;long.&#10;&#10;The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I&#10;tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It&#10;led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been&#10;impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height&#10;of summer.

I reached it.  It remained now only to find&#10;a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.&#10;But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation&#10;but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,&#10;where the dry soil bore only heath.

In all likelihood,&#10;though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself&#10;to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?&#10;Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of&#10;want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.

I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;&#10;as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke&#10;forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the&#10;sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form&#10;shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and&#10;gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,&#10;yet so near, it whispered in my heart--&#10;&#10;&quot;My daughter, flee temptation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mother, I will.&quot;&#10;&#10;So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.

I&#10;approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,&#10;which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,&#10;apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms&#10;and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some&#10;obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the&#10;dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above&#10;it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I&#10;groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a&#10;wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a&#10;sable bush-holly or yew.&#10;&#10;Enter" />

Additionally, the narrator is feeling morally degraded and physically suffering, which makes it difficult for them to bring themselves to beg for relief. These feelings are further complicated by their strong emotions towards Mr. Rochester, whom they worship but must renounce due to their different social status. The narrator's love for Mr. Rochester is so intense that it feels like a &quot;hand of fiery iron&quot; grasping their vitals when they try to leave him.

    <node id="Jane's mournful expression in the schoolroom was due to the tedium of her life and a lack of hope or actual pleasure. However, when the narrator, Mr. Rochester, resumed his notice of her, he observed that there was something glad in her glance and genial in her manner during their conversations. This made Jane feel more socially engaged, which improved her mood.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's renewed attention led him to realize that Jane had a social heart affected by the monotonous schoolroom environment rather than any personal despondency. This revelation sparked a change in Jane, transforming her mournful demeanor into a more hopeful and engaged one when interacting with Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's initially mournful expression was caused by the tedium of her life; however, as the narrator resumed his attention towards her, he recognized her sociable nature.

What caused Jane to cry uncontrollably after helping Mr. Rochester when he capsized his canoe?&#10;&#10;Jane cried uncontrollably after helping Mr. Rochester because she was overwhelmed by the intensity of her emotions and the situation. She had been struggling to hold back her tears, but once they started flowing, she let herself cry heartily. This release of emotion was likely due to a combination of factors: the relief of surviving the accident, the stress of dealing with Mr. Rochester's volatile moods, and the sadness of knowing she must reject his proposal and leave Thornfield Hall.&#10;&#10;2. How did Mr. Rochester respond to her tears?&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester responded to Jane's tears with concern and tenderness. He earnestly entreatied her to be composed, asking her not to cry. When she explained that she could not stop crying while he was in such a passionate state, he assured her that he was not angry but rather loved her too well. Mr. Rochester then tried to soothe Jane by asking her to wipe her eyes and offering her his handkerchief. This response shows Mr. Rochester's deep affection for Jane, as he is visibly affected by her distress and attempts to comfort her in a gentle and caring manner." />

I had been&#10;struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress&#10;them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I&#10;considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.&#10;If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried&#10;heartily.&#10;&#10;Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could&#10;not while he was in such a passion.&#10;&#10;&quot;But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled&#10;your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not&#10;endure it.

    <node id="In this passage, the speaker, Mr. Rochester, is expressing his deep love for Jane, despite her assumption that he would hate her if she were mad. He clarifies that his feelings for her are not based on her mental state, but rather on his strong affection for her as a person. By stating that &quot;every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own,&quot; Mr. Rochester is emphasizing the depth of his love for Jane and his willingness to care for her unconditionally, even in difficult circumstances. Similarly, when he refers to her mind as his &quot;treasure,&quot; he is expressing the value he places on their intellectual connection and shared experiences.

A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the&#10;genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere&#10;long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my&#10;dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.

Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,&#10;and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,&#10;the same balm-like emotion spoke: &quot;Try to eat.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--try,&quot; repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden&#10;bonnet and lifted my head.

    <node id="1. The significant interaction between Jane and Mr. Rochester before she leaves Thornfield Hall occurs when they have a heartfelt conversation after he capsizes his canoe. During this discussion, Mr. Rochester professes his deep love for Jane despite her refusal to kiss him due to his existing marriage. He expresses concern and tenderness towards her, trying to soothe her tears and offering comfort. This interaction showcases the depth of their emotional connection and Mr. Rochester's unwavering affection for Jane.&#10;&#10;2. As Jane prepares to leave Thornfield Hall, she encounters Mr. Rochester in the garden but avoids him, knowing that she must depart without saying goodbye. She gathers some personal items, including a parcel of clothing, a locket, a ring, and twenty shillings from her purse. Jane then whispers goodbye to Mrs. Fairfax and Adele as she passes their rooms and makes her way downstairs. As she leaves the house, she feels kindly toward Mrs. Fairfax and Adele but understands the necessity of escaping the haunting presence of Mr. Rochester's first wife.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's final interaction with Mr. Rochester is a poignant moment where they share their deep love for each other, despite the challenges that lie between them. In contrast, her final words and actions toward him involve avoiding direct confrontation and leaving Thornfield Hall quietly, taking only her personal belongings to start anew elsewhere." />
    <node id="Heatcliff, the protagonist of Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; chooses to die on the moorland because he believes it is a better fate than dying in a workhouse or a pauper's grave. He would rather be picked apart by birds in the wilderness than have his body confined in a workhouse coffin and buried in an unmarked grave.&#10;&#10;To spend his final moments, Heatcliff plans to find a hidden and secure spot on the moorland. As he approaches the hill, he looks for a hollow where he can lie down and feel hidden, even if not entirely secure. The landscape appears level with no variations or distinct features, but Heatcliff continues to wade through the heath until he finds a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle. He sits down under it, using the high banks of moor on each side as protection, creating a shelter for his final moments." />
    <node id="ather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller&#10;might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder&#10;what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless&#10;and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would&#10;sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human&#10;society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my&#10;fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a&#10;good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I&#10;will seek her breast and ask repose.&#10;&#10;I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply&#10;furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I&#10;turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a&#10;hidden angle, I sat down under it.

    <node id="Based on Hannah's account, St. John's father had been ailing for a day and went to sleep, but he never woke up. When Mr. St. John checked on him, he found that his father had already passed away. The reason why St. John didn't have a chance to mention the ladies before his death is because his father's condition deteriorated quickly, and he died suddenly. Hannah mentioned that he was &quot;a bit ailing&quot; the day before, but there was no indication that his illness was severe or life-threatening. When Mr. St. John asked his father if he would like either of his daughters to be sent for, he laughed at him, showing no sign of concern about his health. Therefore, St. John's passing was unexpected, and he didn't have a chance to mention the ladies before his death." />

I was near, and&#10;listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at&#10;least examine into it.

He had&#10;been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when&#10;Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair&#10;laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the&#10;next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver&#10;wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and&#10;fand him.

Both were fair&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The ladies that the speaker is referring to are Diana and Mary Rivers, introduced in Chapter XXXI of &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; They are the sisters of St. John Rivers, who was tending to their ailing father when he passed away suddenly.&#10;2. From Hannah's account, we learn that their father's death was unexpected, as there were no indications of a severe or life-threatening illness the previous day. When Mr. St. John asked his father if he would like either of his daughters to be sent for, he laughed at him, which suggests a lack of concern about his health and further emphasizes the suddenness of his passing.&#10;3. The fact that their father died unexpectedly and without having mentioned the ladies before his death aligns with his personality being described as someone who &quot;laughed away all offers of assistance&quot; when he was ill, showcasing his independent nature." />
    <node id="1. Jane Eyre was motivated to leave Thornfield Hall early in the morning without making a sound due to her desire to avoid direct confrontation with Mr. Rochester and spare him unnecessary distress. She recognized that if she left without notice, he would feel forsaken and suffer, but she believed it was necessary for her own well-being and escape from the haunting presence of his first wife. Jane took practical steps like gathering personal items, oiling the lock, getting water and bread, and leaving quietly through a small wicket gate to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth departure." />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Jane Eyre, does not take any desperate measures to free herself from the tyranny of Conscience. Instead, she tries to endure her suffering in silence and trusts in God's will. This is because her emotional pain stems from her strong feelings for Mr. Rochester, whom she must reject due to their different social status. However, Jane remains determined to fulfill her duty despite the emotional turmoil it causes her.&#10;2. The lack of communication regarding Jane's well-being while she has been isolated is due to several factors:&#10;   - Pride and inability to ask for help: Jane finds it difficult to request assistance from the inhabitants of the house due to her status as a stranger, her lack of acquaintances, and her fear of appearing suspicious or degrading herself by begging.&#10;   - Fear of negative perceptions of strangers: Jane is aware of the negative perception of beggars and fears that she will not be able to convince the inhabitants of the house to help her without arousing suspicion.&#10;   - Emotional turmoil: Jane's emotional state is further complicated by her intense love for Mr. Rochester, which feels like a &quot;hand of fiery iron&quot; grasping her vitals when she tries to leave him. This emotional pain makes it difficult for Jane to focus on anything else and may contribute to her reluctance to communicate her situation to others." />
    <node id=" this&#10;last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this&#10;banishment from my kind!

Let me try to wait His&#10;will in silence.&quot;&#10;&#10;These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my&#10;misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb&#10;and still.&#10;&#10;&quot;All men must die,&quot; said a voice quite close at hand; &quot;but all are not&#10;condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be&#10;if you perished here of want.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who or what speaks?&quot; I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and&#10;incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was&#10;near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented&#10;me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed&#10;to the door" />
    <node id="The narrative you're referring to is from Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and the character serving as the narrator is Mr. Rochester. The negative consequences of his arranged marriage that he had to deal with include his first wife, Bertha Mason, being mentally ill and violent. To keep her existence a secret and prevent harm to others, Mr. Rochester took extreme measures such as:&#10;&#10;1. Keeping the marriage a secret: Mr. Rochester never revealed the truth about his first marriage to anyone, including Jane Eyre. He led people to believe that he was a bachelor, making it easier for him to interact with others socially and professionally without the stigma of being married to a mentally ill woman.&#10;2. Confining Bertha to a secluded room: Due to her mental instability and violent behavior, Mr. Rochester locked his wife away in a secluded room in their home, Thornfield Hall. This prevented her from causing harm to others, but it also further isolated Bertha and contributed to her deteriorating mental state.&#10;3. Denying Bertha proper care: By keeping Bertha's existence a secret, Mr. Rochester also denied her the opportunity to receive professional help or care for her mental illness. This exacerbated Bertha's condition and made it more difficult for Mr. Rochester to manage her behavior over time.&#10;&#10;These extreme measures were taken by Mr. Rochester due to societal norms, stigma attached to mental illness, and his own desire to protect others from harm. However, these actions ultimately led to tragic consequences, as Bertha's confinement and isolation contributed to her demise, and the revelation of their marriage threatened Mr. Rochester's relationship with Jane Eyre." />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Mr. Rochester, deceived Jane by hiding the truth about his existing marriage because he was deeply infatuated with Jane and wanted to be with her. He likely believed that revealing his marital status would jeopardize any chance of a relationship with Jane, so he chose to keep it secret in hopes of winning her affections.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester ultimately decided to reveal his true feelings and ask for Jane's hand in marriage because he could no longer hide the truth from her. After Jane discovered his secret by herself, their relationship became strained, and they had a heated argument during which Jane refused to kiss him due to his deceit. This incident likely prompted Mr. Rochester to come clean about his feelings for Jane and make a genuine effort to win her over by proposing marriage.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Mr. Rochester's deception was motivated by his intense love for Jane, but it ultimately caused harm and led to a significant breach of trust in their relationship. By revealing the truth and asking for Jane's forgiveness, Mr. Rochester took a step towards rebuilding their bond and demonstrating his commitment to her." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Hannah initially only offered the narrator a piece of bread and did not agree to provide a night's shelter in the out-house or anywhere else. She expressed distrust and made it clear that taking in a stranger was unlikely. The narrator pleaded with Hannah to speak to her mistresses, but Hannah refused. After the arrival of Mr. St. John, Hannah still did not offer a place to stay, but she allowed him to admit the narrator into the house. However, there is no mention of Hannah offering any further assistance or shelter to the narrator after this point." />

    <node id="1. What circumstances led the narrator (Mr. Rochester) to conceal his wife's existence in the third-story room of Thornfield?&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester chose to confine his mentally ill wife, Bertha Mason, in a secluded room in Thornfield Hall for several reasons related to societal norms and personal protection:&#10;&#10;a) Arranged marriage: Mr. Rochester had an arranged marriage with Bertha, whom he barely knew before their wedding. After the marriage, he discovered her mental instability and violent behavior.&#10;&#10;b) Keeping the marriage a secret: Due to the stigma attached to mental illness during that time, Mr. Rochester decided to keep his marriage a secret from society, including Jane Eyre, to avoid social repercussions and judgment.&#10;&#10;c) Confinement for safety: By confining Bertha to a secluded room, Mr. Rochester aimed to protect her, himself, and others from harm due to her mental instability and violent tendencies. This also allowed him to maintain some level of control over the situation and prevented further damage to his social standing.&#10;&#10;d) Lack of proper care: By keeping Bertha's existence a secret, Mr. Rochester denied her the opportunity to receive professional help or care for her mental illness, which exacerbated her condition and made it more difficult for him to manage her behavior over time.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Mr. Rochester's decision to conceal his wife in the third-story room of Thornfield Hall was driven by a combination of societal norms, stigma attached to mental illness, and his own desire to protect others from harm. However, this decision led to tragic consequences, as Bertha's confinement and isolation contributed to her demise and threatened Mr. Rochester's relationship with Jane Eyre." />
    <node id=" connection with yourself,&#10;be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.&#10;Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,&#10;and leave her.'&#10;&#10;&quot;I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not&#10;made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first&#10;letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to&#10;experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family&#10;character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I&#10;added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous&#10;conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him&#10;blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish&#10;the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.&#10;&#10;&quot;To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a&#10;monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,&#10;and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret&#10;inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den" />

Jane took practical steps like gathering personal items, oiling the lock, getting water and bread, and leaving quietly through a small wicket gate to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth departure." />
    <node id="1. Based on Mr. Rochester's observation, Jane's state of mind on that snowy day was not mournful or sad as he noticed something &quot;glad&quot; in her glance and &quot;genial&quot; in her manner during their conversations. This change in Jane's demeanor suggests that she felt more socially engaged and happier due to Mr. Rochester's renewed attention, which sparked a transformation in her mood from one of tedium to a more hopeful and engaged one when interacting with him." />
    <node id="According to the narrative, when the narrator stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage over the small latticed window, she could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance from the lozenged panes of the window. Therefore, it can be inferred that the narrator is able to see a simple kitchen or service room inside the house, illuminated by the light from the lozenged window panes." />

On each side stood a&#10;sable bush-holly or yew.&#10;&#10;Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose&#10;to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone&#10;nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared&#10;it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out&#10;the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small&#10;latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the&#10;growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick&#10;over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was&#10;so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed&#10;unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage&#10;shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room&#10;with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter&#10;plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and rad" />

But I'll&#10;shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower&#10;windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my&#10;wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and&#10;she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her&#10;company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms," />
    <node id="The quiet little figure sitting by herself on a stile in Hay Lane, who would later become the arbitress of the first-person narrator's (Mr. Rochester's) life, is Jane Eyre. At this point in the story, Jane is a poor and unknown governess seeking employment, while Mr. Rochester is the master of Thornfield Hall, who encounters Jane by chance before they become emotionally involved." />
    <node id="A stranger, Jane Eyre, arrived at the house at an unusual hour, seeking shelter for the night and a piece of bread to eat. Hannah, the servant who answered the door, responded by distrusting Jane's intentions and initially refusing to offer her shelter. She agreed to give Jane a piece of bread but made it clear that taking in a stranger to lodge was unlikely. Jane pleaded with Hannah to speak to her mistresses, but she refused. After the arrival of Mr. St. John, Hannah allowed him to admit Jane into the house, but there is no mention of her offering further assistance or shelter to Jane after this point." />
    <node id="1. Jane's habitual thoughtful and mournful expression was primarily caused by the tedium of her life as a governess in the schoolroom, which led to a lack of hope or actual pleasure. This expression did not reflect any personal despondency but rather her social heart being affected by the monotonous environment.&#10;&#10;2. The narrator's resumed notice of Jane revealed her true nature by sparking a change in her demeanor. As Mr. Rochester paid more attention to her, he recognized that her mournful expression was due to the schoolroom environment and not any personal sadness. This revelation led to an improvement in Jane's mood, highlighting her capacity for warmth and engagement when given the right circumstances. Her true nature as a sociable person with a strong emotional connection to Mr. Rochester was revealed through this change in observation." />

I sought counsel from the clergyman's residence because I felt that as a stranger in need of employment, the clergyman would be the person most likely to offer assistance or guidance. My pride initially prevented me from directly asking for help, and I hoped that the clergyman would provide advice on how to improve my situation.&#10;2. The elderly woman responded with apparent kindness when I approached her for help. When I asked if this was the parsonage, she answered in the affirmative. However, upon learning that the clergyman was not at home and would not return for some time, I felt unable to ask the housekeeper for assistance due to my pride and fear of negative perceptions of strangers. As a result, I &quot;crawled away&quot; without receiving any help." />

The speaker, Jane Eyre, does not take any desperate measures to free herself from the tyranny of Conscience. Instead, she tries to endure her suffering in silence and trusts in God's will. This is because her emotional pain stems from her strong feelings for Mr. Rochester, whom she must reject due to their different social status. However, Jane remains determined to fulfill her duty despite the emotional turmoil it causes her.&#10;2. The lack of communication regarding Jane's well-being while she has been isolated is due to several factors:&#10;   - Pride and inability to ask for help: Jane finds it difficult to request assistance from the inhabitants of the house due to her status as a stranger, her lack of acquaintances, and her fear of appearing suspicious or degrading herself by begging.&#10;   - Fear of negative perceptions of strangers: Jane is aware of the negative perception of beggars and fears that she will not be able to convince the inhabitants of the house to help her without arousing suspicion.&#10;   - Emotional turmoil: Jane's emotional state is further complicated by her intense love for Mr. Rochester, which feels like a &quot;hand of fiery iron&quot; grasping her vitals when she tries to leave him. This emotional pain makes it difficult for Jane to focus on anything else and may contribute to her reluctance to communicate her situation to others.">

The negative consequences of his arranged marriage that he had to deal with include his first wife, Bertha Mason, being mentally ill and violent. To keep her existence a secret and prevent harm to others, Mr. Rochester took extreme measures such as:&#10;&#10;1. Keeping the marriage a secret: Mr. Rochester never revealed the truth about his first marriage to anyone, including Jane Eyre. He led people to believe that he was a bachelor, making it easier for him to interact with others socially and professionally without the stigma of being married to a mentally ill woman.&#10;2. Confining Bertha to a secluded room: Due to her mental instability and violent behavior, Mr. Rochester locked his wife away in a secluded room in their home, Thornfield Hall. This prevented her from causing harm to others, but it also further isolated Bertha and contributed to her deteriorating mental state.&#10;3. Denying Bertha proper care: By keeping Bertha's existence a secret, Mr. Rochester also denied her the opportunity to receive professional help or care for her mental illness. This exacerbated Bertha's condition and made it more difficult for Mr. Rochester to manage her behavior over time.&#10;&#10;These extreme measures were taken by Mr. Rochester due to societal norms, stigma attached to mental illness, and his own desire to protect others from harm. However, these actions ultimately led to tragic consequences, as Bertha's confinement and isolation contributed to her demise, and the revelation of their marriage threatened Mr. Rochester's relationship with Jane Eyre.">

However, when she actually tried to make the request, she found herself unable to do so due to shame and a feeling of absurdity. Instead, she asked the shopkeeper if she knew of any dressmaker in the village. This change in behavior can be attributed to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Social conditioning: The protagonist comes from a respectable background, as evidenced by her clothing and manners. She is not used to begging for charity and finds it difficult to deviate from societal norms. Asking for work or information about dressmakers is more in line with her social status and upbringing.&#10;2. Pride: The protagonist values her self-respect and dignity. Begging for food or money directly would make her feel vulnerable and humiliated. By asking for work or information, she maintains a sense of control over her situation and preserves her dignity.&#10;3. Uncertainty: The protagonist is unsure whether the shopkeeper will accept her request for charity. She may fear rejection or ridicule. Asking for work or information is a safer option since it is less likely to elicit negative emotions from the shopkeeper.&#10;4. Desire for self-sufficiency: The protagonist wants to earn her own living rather than rely on charity. By asking for work, she shows her determination to be self-reliant and independent, even in the face of adversity.&#10;5. Fear of suspicion: The protagonist is aware that her well-dressed appearance may arouse suspicion among the villagers. By asking for work or information, she hopes to dispel any doubts about her intentions and motivations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the protagonist's struggle to ask for charity reflects her complex emotions and social conditioning. She wants to maintain her dignity, self-respect, and independence while also addressing her immediate needs for food and shelter.">

My pride initially prevented me from directly asking for help, and I hoped that the clergyman would provide advice on how to improve my situation.&#10;2. The elderly woman responded with apparent kindness when I approached her for help. When I asked if this was the parsonage, she answered in the affirmative. However, upon learning that the clergyman was not at home and would not return for some time, I felt unable to ask the housekeeper for assistance due to my pride and fear of negative perceptions of strangers. As a result, I &quot;crawled away&quot; without receiving any help.">

However, Jane remains determined to fulfill her duty despite the emotional turmoil it causes her.&#10;2. The lack of communication regarding Jane's well-being while she has been isolated is due to several factors:&#10;   - Pride and inability to ask for help: Jane finds it difficult to request assistance from the inhabitants of the house due to her status as a stranger, her lack of acquaintances, and her fear of appearing suspicious or degrading herself by begging.&#10;   - Fear of negative perceptions of strangers: Jane is aware of the negative perception of beggars and fears that she will not be able to convince the inhabitants of the house to help her without arousing suspicion.&#10;   - Emotional turmoil: Jane's emotional state is further complicated by her intense love for Mr. Rochester, which feels like a &quot;hand of fiery iron&quot; grasping her vitals when she tries to leave him. This emotional pain makes it difficult for Jane to focus on anything else and may contribute to her reluctance to communicate her situation to others.">

He clarifies that his feelings for her are not based on her mental state, but rather on his strong affection for her as a person. By stating that &quot;every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own,&quot; Mr. Rochester is emphasizing the depth of his love for Jane and his willingness to care for her unconditionally, even in difficult circumstances. Similarly, when he refers to her mind as his &quot;treasure,&quot; he is expressing the value he places on their intellectual connection and shared experiences. Overall, this statement demonstrates Mr. Rochester's deep emotional connection to Jane and his desire to be with her, regardless of external factors that might affect their relationship.">

The negative consequences of his arranged marriage that he had to deal with include his first wife, Bertha Mason, being mentally ill and violent. To keep her existence a secret and prevent harm to others, Mr. Rochester took extreme measures such as:&#10;&#10;1. Keeping the marriage a secret: Mr. Rochester never revealed the truth about his first marriage to anyone, including Jane Eyre. He led people to believe that he was a bachelor, making it easier for him to interact with others socially and professionally without the stigma of being married to a mentally ill woman.&#10;2. Confining Bertha to a secluded room: Due to her mental instability and violent behavior, Mr. Rochester locked his wife away in a secluded room in their home, Thornfield Hall. This prevented her from causing harm to others, but it also further isolated Bertha and contributed to her deteriorating mental state.&#10;3. Denying Bertha proper care: By keeping Bertha's existence a secret, Mr. Rochester also denied her the opportunity to receive professional help or care for her mental illness. This exacerbated Bertha's condition and made it more difficult for Mr. Rochester to manage her behavior over time.&#10;&#10;These extreme measures were taken by Mr. Rochester due to societal norms, stigma attached to mental illness, and his own desire to protect others from harm. However, these actions ultimately led to tragic consequences, as Bertha's confinement and isolation contributed to her demise, and the revelation of their marriage threatened Mr. Rochester's relationship with Jane Eyre.">

You consider my arms filled and my embraces&#10;appropriated?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer&#10;for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess&#10;rightly?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me;" target="After the speaker, who is Jane Eyre, requests to be excused from talking and sits by the fire, she feels overwhelmed with exhaustion. The three people around her discuss what to do with her, and one of the ladies returns to give directions for Jane to be taken upstairs and given dry clothes and a warm bed. Jane thanks God for this act of kindness and falls asleep. This passage is significant because it shows how Jane's fortunes have changed drastically - from being a homeless wanderer, she is now being taken care of by kind strangers.">

To keep her existence a secret and prevent harm to others, Mr. Rochester took extreme measures such as:&#10;&#10;1. Keeping the marriage a secret: Mr. Rochester never revealed the truth about his first marriage to anyone, including Jane Eyre. He led people to believe that he was a bachelor, making it easier for him to interact with others socially and professionally without the stigma of being married to a mentally ill woman.&#10;2. Confining Bertha to a secluded room: Due to her mental instability and violent behavior, Mr. Rochester locked his wife away in a secluded room in their home, Thornfield Hall. This prevented her from causing harm to others, but it also further isolated Bertha and contributed to her deteriorating mental state.&#10;3. Denying Bertha proper care: By keeping Bertha's existence a secret, Mr. Rochester also denied her the opportunity to receive professional help or care for her mental illness. This exacerbated Bertha's condition and made it more difficult for Mr. Rochester to manage her behavior over time.&#10;&#10;These extreme measures were taken by Mr. Rochester due to societal norms, stigma attached to mental illness, and his own desire to protect others from harm.

When Mr. St. John asked his father if he would like either of his daughters to be sent for, he laughed at him, which suggests a lack of concern about his health and further emphasizes the suddenness of his passing.&#10;3.

The speaker, Jane Eyre, does not take any desperate measures to free herself from the tyranny of Conscience. Instead, she tries to endure her suffering in silence and trusts in God's will. This is because her emotional pain stems from her strong feelings for Mr. Rochester, whom she must reject due to their different social status. However, Jane remains determined to fulfill her duty despite the emotional turmoil it causes her.&#10;2. The lack of communication regarding Jane's well-being while she has been isolated is due to several factors:&#10;   - Pride and inability to ask for help: Jane finds it difficult to request assistance from the inhabitants of the house due to her status as a stranger, her lack of acquaintances, and her fear of appearing suspicious or degrading herself by begging.&#10;   - Fear of negative perceptions of strangers: Jane is aware of the negative perception of beggars and fears that she will not be able to convince the inhabitants of the house to help her without arousing suspicion.&#10;   - Emotional turmoil: Jane's emotional state is further complicated by her intense love for Mr. Rochester, which feels like a &quot;hand of fiery iron&quot; grasping her vitals when she tries to leave him. This emotional pain makes it difficult for Jane to focus on anything else and may contribute to her reluctance to communicate her situation to others.">

The speaker, Mr. Rochester, deceived Jane by hiding the truth about his existing marriage because he was deeply infatuated with Jane and wanted to be with her. He likely believed that revealing his marital status would jeopardize any chance of a relationship with Jane, so he chose to keep it secret in hopes of winning her affections.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester ultimately decided to reveal his true feelings and ask for Jane's hand in marriage because he could no longer hide the truth from her. After Jane discovered his secret by herself, their relationship became strained, and they had a heated argument during which Jane refused to kiss him due to his deceit. This incident likely prompted Mr. Rochester to come clean about his feelings for Jane and make a genuine effort to win her over by proposing marriage.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Mr. Rochester's deception was motivated by his intense love for Jane, but it ultimately caused harm and led to a significant breach of trust in their relationship. By revealing the truth and asking for Jane's forgiveness, Mr. Rochester took a step towards rebuilding their bond and demonstrating his commitment to her.">

When Mr. St. John checked on him, he found that his father had already passed away. The reason why St. John didn't have a chance to mention the ladies before his death is because his father's condition deteriorated quickly, and he died suddenly. Hannah mentioned that he was &quot;a bit ailing&quot; the day before, but there was no indication that his illness was severe or life-threatening. When Mr. St. John asked his father if he would like either of his daughters to be sent for, he laughed at him, showing no sign of concern about his health.

He likely believed that revealing his marital status would jeopardize any chance of a relationship with Jane, so he chose to keep it secret in hopes of winning her affections.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester ultimately decided to reveal his true feelings and ask for Jane's hand in marriage because he could no longer hide the truth from her.

Her true nature as a sociable person with a strong emotional connection to Mr. Rochester was revealed through this change in observation.">

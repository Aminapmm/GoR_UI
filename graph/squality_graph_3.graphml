    <node id="The Green Flame's Gamma rays have a powerful effect on living beings. When exposed to these radiations, creatures experience a growing lassitude and lack of energy. As the exposure continues, this condition develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or guidance. In some cases, it can even create a spirit of intolerance. The Green Flames might be considered an inorganic opiate, a substance that is thousands of times more subtle and powerful than any known drug.&#10;&#10;What makes the Gamma rays from the Green Flames so unique and challenging to analyze is their peculiar combination of Beta or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons. This unusual composition sets them apart from other forms of radiation, making it difficult for scientists to fully understand and analyze their characteristics. The Gamma rays are also part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but their position within that spectrum remains elusive and unclear due to their unusual nature." />

To make a long story short, I got him talking about&#10;his adventures, and he told me plenty.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The old woman paused. &quot;Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?&quot; she&#10;asked abruptly.&#10; &#10;  I shook my head. &quot;Some new kind of ...&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active&#10;rock once found on Mercury. The&#10;Alpha&#10;rays of this rock are similar&#10;to radium in that they consist of streams of material particles&#10;projected at high speed. But the character of the&#10;Gamma&#10;rays has&#10;never been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are&#10;electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of&#10;Beta&#10;or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.&#10; &#10;  &quot;When any form of life is exposed to these&#10;Gamma&#10;rays from the Green&#10;Flame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude&#10;and lack of energy.

The&#10;Doctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but&#10;they were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations&#10;from the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and&#10;their wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic&#10;scale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;But with what motive?&quot; I demanded. &quot;Why should...?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Power!&quot; the old woman answered. &quot;The old thirst for dictatorial&#10;control of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,&#10;Doctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the&#10;minds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy?

    <node id="? The Green Flames'&#10;radiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.&quot;&#10; &#10;  I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.&#10; &#10;  And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the&#10;tents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had&#10;dropped away to be replaced by another.&#10; &#10;  There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the&#10;impression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And&#10;simultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the&#10;old prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.&#10; &#10;  An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was&#10;followed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.&#10;Opposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar&#10;punishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It's the Varsoom!&quot; Ezra Karn yelled. &quot;We've got to make 'em laugh.

The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,&#10;a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.&quot;&#10; &#10;  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three&#10;planets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The&#10;cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long&#10;enough to endanger all civilized life.&#10; &#10;  &quot;The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing&#10;government was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had&#10;ordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was&#10;immediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom&#10;followed.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.&#10;" />
    <node id=" moment later the silence of&#10;the march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe&#10;program.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Great stuff,&quot; Karn commented. &quot;I sent in a couple of questions once,&#10;but I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought&#10;to make him king or somethin'.&quot;&#10; &#10;  For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped&#10;to her feet.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Say that again!&quot; she cried.&#10; &#10;  The old prospector looked startled. &quot;Why, I only said they ought to&#10;make this Doctor Universe the big boss and....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's it!&quot; Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness&#10;and returned quickly. &quot;Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this&#10;is&#10;Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a&#10;method to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's&#10;hold.

    <node id=". The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is&#10;happening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,&#10;police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by&#10;representation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military&#10;dictator to step in.&#10; &#10;  &quot;And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a&#10;single shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in&#10;my opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand&#10;times more potent and is transmiting it&#10;en masse&#10;.&quot;&#10; &#10;  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would&#10;have called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of&#10;approaching danger.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Let's get out of here,&quot; I said, getting up.&#10;Zinnng-whack!&#10;&quot;All right!&quot;&#10; &#10;  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks&#10;appeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the&#10;fresco seemed to melt away suddenly.&#10; &#10;  A heat ray" />
    <node id="even though she had been thrown out of the Spacemen's Club on Venus, Grannie Annie remains undeterred in pursuing her passion for writing science fiction.

    <node id=" staring silently&#10;out before her.&#10; &#10;  But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all&#10;sides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR&#10;UNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN&#10;AUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Grannie,&quot; I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE&#10;JET, &quot;what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?&quot;&#10; &#10;  She looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't&#10;appreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell&#10;yarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background&#10;material?&quot;&#10; &#10;  I shook my head. &quot;Not me,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10;  But I knew I would.&#10;" />
    <node id=".&#10;You gotta wait 'til I hear it.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He&#10;flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a&#10;chair, listening with avid interest.&#10; &#10;  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I&#10;heard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once&#10;again I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back&#10;and forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi&#10;screen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead&#10;my thoughts far away.&#10;Half an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen&#10;were ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We&#10;camped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed&#10;about us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and&#10;despondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the&#10;futility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me&#10;from turning back. On the" />

She had probably written more drivel&#10;in the name of science fiction than anyone alive.&#10; &#10;  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for&#10;more. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers&#10;sat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.&#10; &#10;  One thing you had to admit about her books.

Sharp and dear his&#10;voice echoed through the theater:&#10; &#10;  &quot;&#10;Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?&#10;&quot;&#10; &#10;  Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her&#10;hand. She said quietly:&#10; &#10;  &quot;Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed&#10;tracto-car.&quot;&#10; &#10;  And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in&#10;the visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian&#10;cafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering&#10;bantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,&#10;or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of&#10;the winner.&#10; &#10;  It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had&#10;brought me here. And then I began to notice things.&#10; &#10;  The audience in the&#10;Satellite&#10;seemed to have lost much of its&#10;original fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the&#10;signal of Doctor Universe. The spell" />

We've got to stop&#10;Doctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.&#10;Right now we're nicely bottled up.&quot;&#10; &#10;  As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz&#10;master on the screen. He was saying:&#10; &#10;  &quot;&#10;Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of&#10;unparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow&#10;night I urge you, I command you, to tune in.&#10;&quot;&#10; &#10;  With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the&#10;Venusians.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Bring all our equipment in here,&quot; she ordered. &quot;Hurry!&quot;&#10; &#10;  She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap.

The situation on Jupiter was swiftly&#10;coming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that&#10;representative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held&#10;to find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.&#10; &#10;  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my&#10;tent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe&#10;Grannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots&#10;which she had skilfully blended into a novel?&#10; &#10;  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its&#10;place a ringing silence blanketed everything.&#10; &#10;  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in&#10;undulating sweeps toward the center of the camp.

Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,&#10;missing the thing by the narrowest of margins.&#10; &#10;  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress&#10;appeared. Grannie gave a single warning:&#10; &#10;  &quot;Stand still!&quot;&#10; &#10;  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us&#10;again. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of&#10;purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the&#10;air. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the&#10;ground and shot aloft.&#10;Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.&#10;I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.&#10; &#10;  &quot;In heaven's name, what was it?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hunter-bird,&quot; Grannie said calmly. &quot;A form of avian life found here&#10;in the swamp.

The water here&#10;resembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding&#10;ribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the&#10;surface.

You&#10;see, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the&#10;ship.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours&#10;tossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned&#10;steadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi&#10;just before retiring still lingered in my mind.

    <node id="During the three-week return trip to Swamp City, Grannie Annie and the narrator were followed by the Varsoom, who seemed to be amused by something.

And for the first time in my&#10;life, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shook&#10;her fist at the unseen hordes out before her.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Ignorant slap-happy fools!&quot; she screamed. &quot;You don't know good science&#10;fiction when you hear it.&quot;&#10; &#10;  I turned to Karn and said quietly, &quot;Turn on the visi set. Doctor&#10;Universe should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull in&#10;as much of that laughter as you can.&quot;&#10;It took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City.

She read slowly&#10;at first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and more&#10;dramatically.&#10; &#10;  And out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening.&#10; &#10;  &quot;...&#10;the space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shot&#10;from the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the control&#10;cabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to free&#10;himself.

Initially, they had shown fervor and applauded spontaneously; however, as time passed, their enthusiasm waned, and they only clapped when prompted by Doctor Universe's signal. This change in their behavior suggests that they may have been manipulated or controlled in some way.&#10;&#10;Grannie Annie brought the narrator to the trivia game to help her solve a mystery. She suspected that the man behind the scenes, who later turned out to be Doctor Universe himself, had stolen her manuscript and devised a method to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's hold. Grannie Annie wanted to attend the event to observe and gather information that could potentially help her identify and expose the culprit. She ultimately realized that Doctor Universe was the one responsible for these wrongdoings during the trivia game.&#10;&#10;In summary, the audience at the Satellite Theater seemed less enthusiastic because they were likely being controlled or manipulated, while Grannie Annie brought the narrator there to help her solve a mystery and uncover the true identity of the person pulling the strings behind the scenes." />

The radiations from the Green Flames are stepped up by this unit and then transmitted through a tholpane plate in the lower hold.&#10;&#10;Based on the story, it seems that the mechanism cannot be accessed directly, as the stepto glass wall is impenetrable. However, Grannie and her team come up with a plan to access the broadcasting unit by dismantling a portable visi set and using its components to create a makeshift apparatus. They also use a coil of flexible copper mesh and several Micro-Wellman tubes to fashion a device that can receive and block the radiations from the Green Flames.&#10;&#10;Grannie plans to use this device to tune into the Doctor Universe quiz program, which is being used as a cover for transmitting the radiations.

The Venusians, apparently&#10;unawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire&#10;and erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding&#10;desolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this&#10;time was a gloomy affair.

If an expert fails to answer a question, the sender receives a check for one thousand planetoles. This event format allows for audience interaction, education about different planets, and entertainment through competition.

This seems to appease them and stop their attacks. In the excerpt, Ezra Karn achieves this by leaping around wildly and accidentally falling into a campfire, which prompts the Varsoom to start laughing. Once they begin laughing, the attacks stop.

    <node id="The Green Flames are a radio-active rock originally found on Mercury. They emit a unique type of Gamma rays that are challenging to analyze due to their unusual composition, which includes Beta or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons. These Gamma rays can have significant effects on living beings, causing lassitude (a state of physical or mental weariness) and lack of energy in the short term. Prolonged exposure may lead to a sense of impotence, desire for leadership or guidance, and even intolerance in some cases.&#10;&#10;The Green Flames' Gamma rays are considered an inorganic opiate, being thousands of times more subtle and powerful than any known drug, affecting the brain and behavior of creatures exposed to them. If millions of individuals were exposed to these radiations simultaneously, it could have severe consequences for freedom, individual liberty, and representative government. The Green Flames played a significant role in the short-lived but dangerous dictatorship of Vennox I on Venus, making their containment crucial for maintaining civilized life and ensuring political freedom." />

A visi set is likely a type of television or communication device that allows him to stay informed about what is happening in the wider world. This could mean that he has contacts with other people or organizations, and may be able to use these connections to help Grannie Annie and the narrator on their quest.

The corridor was bare of furnishings, but beyond the glass, they could see a two-room hut.&#10;2. The hut contained the latest type of visi set, indicating that the owner of the ship was not completely isolated from civilization. However, they did not find any signs of life inside the ship.&#10;3.

    <node id="Based on the story, Grannie Annie's plan for the future involves pursuing her passion for writing science fiction, particularly a new story idea about Mars. She remains determined to continue writing despite the setbacks she has faced, showcasing persistence and resilience in the face of adversity. The narrator initially declines to join Grannie in her research but later plans to do so due to her unwavering determination and the intrigue surrounding her previous experiences and discoveries. Therefore, the listener (the narrator) will eventually be joining Grannie in her pursuits." />
    <node id="The person who was tapped on the shoulder by the Venusian bellboy in the billiard room of the Spacemen's Club in Swamp City is the narrator. This individual may be in danger because Grannie Annie, a science fiction writer and a woman, has stumbled upon a murderous plot that is more terrifying than any she has ever concocted. The villain of this plot is not worried about Grannie Annie but rather the person he is shooting at, which is implied to be the narrator. It is unclear how the narrator is connected to this plot or why they are being targeted, but it is likely that they will become further involved in the story as it unfolds." />

    <node id="Annabella C. Flowers is a successful and prolific science fiction author, known for her dime novel style stories that are popular among readers despite not being critically acclaimed. She has an annual income that totals into six figures and has been writing more science fiction than anyone else alive. Annabella is also known for ignoring outdated laws and conventions, as evidenced by her presence in the Spacemen's Club on Venus, which only allows men and does not permit women. Despite this setback, she remains determined to pursue her passion for writing science fiction and is currently gathering background material for a new story idea about Mars." />

    <node id="Doctor Universe is a quiz master or game show host who presides over a question-and-answer event featuring nine experts. Each expert is responsible for answering questions related to one of the nine planets. The purpose of their presence on stage before the Satellite audience in Swamp City is to engage viewers and listeners from various planets by having them pose questions that the experts will attempt to answer correctly. If an expert fails to answer a question, the sender receives a check for one thousand planetoles. This format allows for audience interaction, education about different planets, and entertainment through competition. However, as revealed later in the story, Doctor Universe had ulterior motives – he aimed to use this platform to bid for system dictatorship, which was ultimately thwarted by ridicule from an unseen audience." />
    <node id="1. Grannie perceives a potential problem in the crowd's disgraceful behavior towards the Martian and their lack of control by the I.P. men, which could lead to dangerous consequences or conflicts. This is evident through Grannie Annie's concern, indicated by the glitter in her eyes as she quietly expresses her doubts.&#10;2. Grannie also perceives a need for entertainment and laughter from the Varsoom creatures, which she believes is their only chance of escape or befriending them. She addresses this issue by reading excerpts from her science fiction book in a radiant circle provided by a search lamp, hoping to attract the Varsoom's attention and make them laugh.&#10;3. Grannie has faced setbacks and ridicule as a science fiction writer, but she remains determined to pursue her passion for writing. She has an idea for a new story about Mars and intends to gather background material for it. By continuing to embrace her identity as a science fiction writer, Grannie is addressing the problem of adversity and setbacks by demonstrating persistence and resilience in her craft.&#10;4. Although not explicitly stated, there might be an underlying issue with the narrator's initial reluctance to join Grannie in her research for the new Mars story. However, Grannie's unwavering determination and intriguing past experiences eventually convince the narrator to change their mind and join her pursuits.&#10;&#10;In summary, Grannie perceives problems related to interspecies conflicts and her writing career but addresses them through proactive actions like entertaining the Varsoom and continuing to write science fiction despite setbacks. She also influences others, such as the narrator, by inspiring them with her determination and persistence." />

They emit a unique type of Gamma rays that are challenging to analyze due to their unusual composition, which includes Beta or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons. These Gamma rays can have significant effects on living beings, causing lassitude (a state of physical or mental weariness) and lack of energy in the short term. Prolonged exposure may lead to a sense of impotence, desire for leadership or guidance, and even intolerance in some cases.&#10;&#10;The Green Flames' Gamma rays are considered an inorganic opiate, being thousands of times more subtle and powerful than any known drug, affecting the brain and behavior of creatures exposed to them. If millions of individuals were exposed to these radiations simultaneously, it could have severe consequences for freedom, individual liberty, and representative government. The Green Flames played a significant role in the short-lived but dangerous dictatorship of Vennox I on Venus, making their containment crucial for maintaining civilized life and ensuring political freedom.">

The helpless Kagor&#10;was seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,&#10;snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned&#10;into his mouth.&#10; &#10;  Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men&#10;rushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to&#10;shout derisive epithets.&#10; &#10;  Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm&#10;and led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read&#10;THE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place&#10;was all but deserted.&#10; &#10;  In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober&#10;eyes.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?&quot;&#10; &#10;  I nodded. &quot;As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen.

    <edge source="Grannie Annie didn't believe that the I.P. men were strong enough to control the disgraceful behavior of the crowd towards the Martian. She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes, indicating her concern or disapproval of the situation." target="1. Grannie perceives a potential problem in the crowd's disgraceful behavior towards the Martian and their lack of control by the I.P. men, which could lead to dangerous consequences or conflicts. This is evident through Grannie Annie's concern, indicated by the glitter in her eyes as she quietly expresses her doubts.&#10;2. Grannie also perceives a need for entertainment and laughter from the Varsoom creatures, which she believes is their only chance of escape or befriending them. She addresses this issue by reading excerpts from her science fiction book in a radiant circle provided by a search lamp, hoping to attract the Varsoom's attention and make them laugh.&#10;3. Grannie has faced setbacks and ridicule as a science fiction writer, but she remains determined to pursue her passion for writing. She has an idea for a new story about Mars and intends to gather background material for it. By continuing to embrace her identity as a science fiction writer, Grannie is addressing the problem of adversity and setbacks by demonstrating persistence and resilience in her craft.&#10;4. Although not explicitly stated, there might be an underlying issue with the narrator's initial reluctance to join Grannie in her research for the new Mars story. However, Grannie's unwavering determination and intriguing past experiences eventually convince the narrator to change their mind and join her pursuits.&#10;&#10;In summary, Grannie perceives problems related to interspecies conflicts and her writing career but addresses them through proactive actions like entertaining the Varsoom and continuing to write science fiction despite setbacks. She also influences others, such as the narrator, by inspiring them with her determination and persistence.">

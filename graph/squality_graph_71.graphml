    <node id="Based on the story, man's natural life and progress before going back into the cave, as described by the character referred to as &quot;he,&quot; involved a long and slow process of advancing from living in caves. The key point here is that man was growing and making progress, with his dreams and plans for exploring space getting bigger and grander over time. This original state of progression and ambition is considered more desirable than man's current state because, instead of continuing to reach for the stars, man has retreated back into a limited, cave-like existence due to fear and the traumas of the past. The character laments that man has stopped building his dreams and becoming better, and has instead become overly focused on the safety provided by the Projects, which are compared to caves." />

It is not. Is this even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.&quot; He spun back to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed it as though it were a finger, not a gun. &quot;Listen, you,&quot; he snapped.&#10;&quot;Man was progressing.

And Man was reaching out for it.&quot; He glared as though daring me to doubt it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy, he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded politely.&#10; &#10; &quot;So what happened?&quot; he demanded, and immediately answered himself.&#10;&quot;I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did.

That's what he did!&quot;&#10; &#10; To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme understatement.

Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.&quot;&#10; &#10; And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm a trained atomic engineer,&quot; he went on. &quot;In my project, I worked on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job, and they knew it." />

The ever-present threat of other projects had never been more for me—or for most other people either, I suspected—than occasional ore-sleds that didn't return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr. Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.&#10; &#10; Dr. Kilbillie—Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years old—had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.

I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing, took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.&#10; &#10; On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with difficulty.&#10; &#10; I read them. They said:&#10; &#10; &#10; EMERGENCY ENTRANCE ELEVATOR SHAFT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY KEEP LOCKED&#10; &#10; I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed shut" />

Who cares about that?&quot;&#10; &#10; He frowned bitterly. &quot;The same answer,&quot; he muttered, more to himself than to me. &quot;The same answer every time. You people have crawled into your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.&quot;&#10; &#10; I looked around at my apartment. &quot;Rather a well-appointed cave,&quot; I told him.&#10; &#10; &quot;But a cave nevertheless.&quot; He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with a fanatical flame. &quot;Don't you ever wish to get Outside?&quot;&#10; &#10; Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. &quot;Outside? Of course not!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The same thing,&quot; he grumbled, &quot;over and over again. Always the same stupidity.

My bellowing was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.&#10; &#10; I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it, giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as rationally as you could please, &quot;Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I-am-sorry-sir-but-that——&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stop,&quot; I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her looking at me.

It didn't arrive.&#10; &#10; I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.&#10; &#10; I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female receptionist &quot;My name is Rice!&quot; I bellowed. &quot;Edmund Rice!

If it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.&#10; &#10; It didn't arrive.&#10; &#10; I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to give her advance warning that I would be late?&#10; &#10; Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.&#10; &#10; Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted.&#10; &#10; Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight.

It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I was giving myself plenty of time.&#10; &#10; But then the elevator didn't come.&#10; &#10; I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't understand it.&#10; &#10; The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.&#10; &#10; I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If it didn't" />

I understand your—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You understand ?&quot; I trembled with speechless fury.&#10; &#10; She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen, revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay any attention to. &quot;We're not supposed to give this information out, sir,&quot; she said, her voice low, &quot;but I'm going to tell you, so you'll understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is—&quot; she leaned even closer to the screen—&quot;there's a spy in the elevator.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; It was my turn to be stunned.&#10; &#10; I just gaped at her. &quot;A—a" />
    <node id=", and of how many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the other side of them.&#10; &#10; I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.&#10; &#10; I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen. I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient reason for me to be late.&#10; &#10; He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.&#10; &#10; I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.&#10; &#10; I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of stairs since I was twelve years old.&#10; &#10; Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators, didn't we? Usually" />

He takes the situation in stride and begins his descent, pausing only to wonder about a smallish door he encounters along the way.

    <node id=" of stairs since I was twelve years old.&#10; &#10; Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators, didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was the use of stairs?&#10; &#10; Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary information), the Project had been built when there still had been such things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.&#10; &#10; And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.&#10; &#10; Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.

    <node id="According to Dr. Kilbillie, the two most important factors that led to the rise of the Projects were the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion resulted in a lack of space, leading to the transformation of housing from horizontal expansion to vertical. By the end of the century, everyone lived in self-sufficient Projects that were completely enclosed, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, separate floors for schools and churches, and factories. The design and functionality of these projects evolved significantly over the course of the 20th century. Initially, small attempts were made to make the Projects more than just dwelling places by including restaurants, shopping centers, babysitting services, and dry cleaners. By mid-century, projects included a host of other adjuncts, and by the end of the century, they were completely self-sufficient. The ever-present threat of other projects led to occasional skirmishes, but for the most part, life within the Project was full and relatively safe." />
    <node id=" the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as World Wars One, Two, and Three.&#10; &#10; The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of many many factors, but two of the most important were the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course, meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects&#10;(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of other adjuncts.

And all because of, among other things, the population explosion.&#10; &#10; And the Treaty of Oslo.&#10; &#10; It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which meant that no Projects were bombed.&#10; &#10; Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or at least those" />

    <node id="Based on the story, there are no specific indications mentioned that directly suggest the protagonist's project is planning to attack the enemy project. The enemy spy initially asked if the protagonist had heard of any such plans, and when pressed for an explanation, the spy argued that if the protagonist's project was looking for signs of attack, then it would make sense for the enemy to do the same. The spy then pointed out that their defenses are non-existent or inadequate, making an attack more feasible. However, there is no concrete evidence presented in the dialogue itself.&#10;&#10;In fact, when the protagonist admits not following the spy's argument, the spy gets angry and shouts, which further implies that there is a lack of actual evidence against the protagonist's project.&#10;&#10;Additionally, it is important to consider the context: this conversation takes place in an elevator between floors 146 and 147, making it highly unlikely for either party to have access to sensitive or incriminating information at that moment. The spy's accusations appear to be based more on fear-mongering and manipulation than any actual evidence." />

The Army is trying to remove him from the elevator, but he is actively resisting their efforts. If the Army is unable to capture the spy, there could be significant consequences. These may include the loss of life if the spy successfully crushes anyone who tries to reach him in the shaft, as well as the potential for further security breaches if the spy is able to communicate with other enemies while he remains at large.

The stairs provide an alternate means for individuals to navigate the building safely, avoiding the dangerous situation presented by the jammed elevator. Additionally, the stairs offer a physical barrier between potential threats and those using them, as the walls of the stairwell serve as safeguards so long as all potential enemies remain on the other side. However, it is important to exercise caution when using the stairs, as the narrator encounters a smallish door along the way, which may present additional risks or challenges." />

    <node id="The Projects became self-sufficient with hydroponic food production, separate floors for various facilities, and robotic ore-sleds primarily due to two main factors: the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion led to a significant lack of space, causing housing to transform from horizontal expansion to vertical living in Projects. By the end of the century, these Projects were completely enclosed and self-sufficient, containing facilities like schools, churches, factories, and hydroponic food production in sub-basements.&#10;&#10;The Treaty of Oslo played a role by preventing strategic atomic weapons from being used during wars, which meant that Projects were not directly targeted or destroyed. However, tactical atomic weapons were still used extensively, resulting in widespread radioactivity across the world, except for within the Projects. This further emphasized the need for self-sufficiency and self-containment within the Projects to protect their inhabitants from external dangers.&#10;&#10;Robotic ore-sleds were developed to seek out raw materials that were unavailable within the Projects, ensuring their self-sufficiency and ability to sustain their populations without relying on external resources." />
    <node id="The self-sufficient Project is a massive, completely enclosed building spanning two hundred stories. It is a nation unto itself, with all necessary facilities and amenities for its inhabitants, including food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, schools, churches, factories, shops, restaurants, babysitting services, and dry cleaners. People never enter or leave the Project, leading to a sense of isolation from external dangers, which are reduced to abstract threats lurking at the backs of their minds. The Project's design and functionality evolved significantly over the 20th century as small attempts were made to make these structures more than just dwelling places, eventually becoming completely self-sufficient by the end of the century.&#10;&#10;Dr. Kilbillie, a historian in the story, had private names for every major war of the 20th century. He referred to World War One as the Ignoble Nobleman's War, World War Two as the Racial Non-Racial War, and World War Three as the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. According to Dr. Kilbillie, the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo were two major factors that led to the rise of the Projects. The Treaty of Oslo was significant because it prevented atomic war between two nations with atomic weapons by allowing only tactical weapons to be used. This ensured that no cities or infrastructure (like the Projects) were targeted, preserving them in the process. However, both sides still used tactical weapons extensively, leaving most of the world quite radioactive, except for the Projects." />

There were thirty-two hundred stairs in the building, but despite the inconvenience and added time, the narrator decided to use the stairs in order to reach his true love's floor." />
    <node id="Based on the story, the enemy spy is likely referring to any potential military equipment or defenses that the protagonist's project might have, which could be used for offensive purposes against the enemy project. However, the spy himself admits that the defenses are non-existent, and the protagonist confirms that the rocket launchers on the roof are rusted through with age, making them ineffective.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the spy claims that the Army is only supplied with uniforms, whistles, and hand guns, which suggests a lack of substantial military equipment or firepower. The protagonist initially disagrees with the spy's assessment but eventually realizes that the state of security in the Project may not be as robust as he had previously thought.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is unclear what specific military equipment or defenses the enemy spy is referring to, as the story does not provide enough details about the nature and extent of the projects' military capabilities." />

First, it is possible that recent maps of the building no longer include this door because it is an old, discarded, and unnecessary entrance, making guarding it unnecessary. Additionally, the door might have been sealed shut on the other side or simply overlooked due to human error during the map-making process. Another possibility is that the Army has already caught the spy who had been using the elevator shaft, therefore there would be no need for guards at this door.

This caused them to abandon their dreams of exploring space and retreat back to what they considered safe and familiar – the &quot;caves&quot; or Projects that they had originally emerged from in their progression.

It is a nation unto itself, with all necessary facilities and amenities for its inhabitants, including food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, schools, churches, factories, shops, restaurants, babysitting services, and dry cleaners. People never enter or leave the Project, leading to a sense of isolation from external dangers, which are reduced to abstract threats lurking at the backs of their minds. The Project's design and functionality evolved significantly over the 20th century as small attempts were made to make these structures more than just dwelling places, eventually becoming completely self-sufficient by the end of the century.&#10;&#10;Dr. Kilbillie, a historian in the story, had private names for every major war of the 20th century. He referred to World War One as the Ignoble Nobleman's War, World War Two as the Racial Non-Racial War, and World War Three as the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. According to Dr. Kilbillie, the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo were two major factors that led to the rise of the Projects. The Treaty of Oslo was significant because it prevented atomic war between two nations with atomic weapons by allowing only tactical weapons to be used. This ensured that no cities or infrastructure (like the Projects) were targeted, preserving them in the process. However, both sides still used tactical weapons extensively, leaving most of the world quite radioactive, except for the Projects.">

He believes that if the protagonist's project is looking for signs of attack, then the enemy would also do the same. By staying inside the apartment, he can gather more information and potentially uncover the truth about the protagonist's intentions. Additionally, by threatening to tie up the speaker, he ensures that he has enough time to search for evidence before leaving or taking further action.">

First, it is possible that recent maps of the building no longer include this door because it is an old, discarded, and unnecessary entrance, making guarding it unnecessary. Additionally, the door might have been sealed shut on the other side or simply overlooked due to human error during the map-making process. Another possibility is that the Army has already caught the spy who had been using the elevator shaft, therefore there would be no need for guards at this door. The spy's presence in the elevator shaft and his ability to take control of its manual controls have led to significant consequences, including a dangerous situation where he can aim the elevator at anyone trying to reach him in the shaft, potentially causing loss of life and further security breaches if he is able to communicate with other enemies while at large.">

This gives him the ability to aim the elevator at anyone who tries to get into the shaft, using it as a weapon to try and crush them. The Army is trying to remove him from the elevator, but he is actively resisting their efforts. If the Army is unable to capture the spy, there could be significant consequences. These may include the loss of life if the spy successfully crushes anyone who tries to reach him in the shaft, as well as the potential for further security breaches if the spy is able to communicate with other enemies while he remains at large. The situation also highlights a larger issue: if one spy has been able to make it to the 147th floor undetected, there may be others who have done so as well. This could put the entire project and everyone involved in it at risk.">

At sixteen steps a flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.&#10; &#10; Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could. If the door would open.&#10; &#10; It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and finally" target="The self-sufficient Project is a massive, completely enclosed building spanning two hundred stories. It is a nation unto itself, with all necessary facilities and amenities for its inhabitants, including food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, schools, churches, factories, shops, restaurants, babysitting services, and dry cleaners. People never enter or leave the Project, leading to a sense of isolation from external dangers, which are reduced to abstract threats lurking at the backs of their minds. The Project's design and functionality evolved significantly over the 20th century as small attempts were made to make these structures more than just dwelling places, eventually becoming completely self-sufficient by the end of the century.&#10;&#10;Dr. Kilbillie, a historian in the story, had private names for every major war of the 20th century. He referred to World War One as the Ignoble Nobleman's War, World War Two as the Racial Non-Racial War, and World War Three as the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. According to Dr. Kilbillie, the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo were two major factors that led to the rise of the Projects. The Treaty of Oslo was significant because it prevented atomic war between two nations with atomic weapons by allowing only tactical weapons to be used. This ensured that no cities or infrastructure (like the Projects) were targeted, preserving them in the process. However, both sides still used tactical weapons extensively, leaving most of the world quite radioactive, except for the Projects.">

These may include the loss of life if the spy successfully crushes anyone who tries to reach him in the shaft, as well as the potential for further security breaches if the spy is able to communicate with other enemies while he remains at large. The situation also highlights a larger issue: if one spy has been able to make it to the 147th floor undetected, there may be others who have done so as well. This could put the entire project and everyone involved in it at risk.">

It is a nation unto itself, with all necessary facilities and amenities for its inhabitants, including food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, schools, churches, factories, shops, restaurants, babysitting services, and dry cleaners. People never enter or leave the Project, leading to a sense of isolation from external dangers, which are reduced to abstract threats lurking at the backs of their minds. The Project's design and functionality evolved significantly over the 20th century as small attempts were made to make these structures more than just dwelling places, eventually becoming completely self-sufficient by the end of the century.&#10;&#10;Dr. Kilbillie, a historian in the story, had private names for every major war of the 20th century. He referred to World War One as the Ignoble Nobleman's War, World War Two as the Racial Non-Racial War, and World War Three as the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. According to Dr. Kilbillie, the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo were two major factors that led to the rise of the Projects. The Treaty of Oslo was significant because it prevented atomic war between two nations with atomic weapons by allowing only tactical weapons to be used. This ensured that no cities or infrastructure (like the Projects) were targeted, preserving them in the process. However, both sides still used tactical weapons extensively, leaving most of the world quite radioactive, except for the Projects.">

    <edge source="According to the speaker's perspective, humanity's natural and desirable life is one of progression, growth, and ambition. He believes that man was meant to build his dreams and become better over time, with dreams and plans for exploring space getting bigger and grander. The key example he gives is man's history of planning to tackle space exploration, starting with the moon, then the planets, and finally other galaxies.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the speaker sees man's current state as a retreat into a limited, cave-like existence due to fear and traumas of the past. He laments that man has stopped building his dreams and becoming better, and has instead become overly focused on the safety provided by the Projects, which are compared to caves.&#10;&#10;The speaker's perspective is influenced by a man he meets, who claims to have arrived from a nearby project without any radiation protection, indicating that the radiation level outside has significantly decreased. The man asserts that the radiation level is now &quot;practically as low as it was before the Atom War&quot; and has been so for at least ten years, leading him to believe that the world outside is safe and mankind can emerge from their shelters to rebuild their dreams." target="According to the man's story, humanity's ambitious space exploration plans regressed because of fear, represented by the metaphor of &quot;a hotfoot.&quot; The man describes how humanity was on the brink of making its &quot;first giant step&quot; into space, but just as they were about to do so, they were scared away by an unspecified trauma or setback. This caused them to abandon their dreams of exploring space and retreat back to what they considered safe and familiar – the &quot;caves&quot; or Projects that they had originally emerged from in their progression. The man's story implies that this fear was unwarranted, as evidenced by the significantly decreased radiation levels outside, but it still had a profound impact on humanity's aspirations and actions.">

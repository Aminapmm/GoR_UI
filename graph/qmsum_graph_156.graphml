    <node id="The transcript shows a debate between various political figures in Canada regarding systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, including the issue of racial profiling in policing. The Minister of Public Safety, Bill Blair, acknowledges that racial profiling is unlawful and contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act. He also mentions that they are working diligently within federal agencies to ensure that all officers receive training on culturally competent and bias-free delivery of service. However, he did not explicitly commit to ending street checks or carding immediately.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is recognition of the issue of systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism in Canada, including racial profiling in policing, and a commitment to training on culturally competent and bias-free delivery of service, there is no explicit commitment to ending the practice of street checks or carding immediately." />
    <node id=" police, the architect of this country's largest profiling program under the guise of street checks or carding, was made this country's Minister of Public Safety by this Prime Minister. As the tragic consequence of the unlawful, unconstitutional and racist practices in Toronto, black people are 20 times more likely than non-black people to be murdered by police. Does the Minister of Public Safety now admit that the police practice of street checks and carding is in fact a significant factor in Canada's systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, and will he act to immediately end it today?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Blair&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, let me be very clear. First of all, every Canadian is entitled to bias-free and culturally competent policing. I know from experience that there is nothing more corrosive to the relationship of trust that must exist between the police and racialized communities than the issue of racism or the biased influences of those decisions. Mr. Chair, racial profiling is not only abhorrent and unacceptable, it's in fact unlawful. It's contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it's contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act. We are working diligently within all of the federal agencies under my purview to ensure that all officers receive training" />

Yes, I will work across all departments to ensure that data is better collected.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Matthew Green&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, that's not a legal requirement.

The Prime Minister has the power to do something about the anti-black racism that Canada is faced with. Will the Prime Minister end racial profiling in Canada against black people once and for all?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, this government was the first government to recognize anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and unconscious bias and to take concrete actions against them in the context of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent but also in the context of a country that stands up for human rights and protects everyone. We have made significant steps forward, but there is so much to do, and I look forward to working with all members in this House to do just that.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Jagmeet Singh&#10;Content: I did not hear an answer. Will the Prime Minister end the racial profiling of black people in Canada?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon.

Will the minister now apologize to the black community for the harm caused under his tenure as chief of police?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Blair&#10;Content: Just to be very clear, Mr. Chair, I actually worked with the diverse communities of Toronto for nearly four decades. I worked with extraordinary leaders from the black community and I learned extensively from their lived experience. We worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of all of the people in all of our diverse communities.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Matthew Green&#10;Content: Bill C-51 was introduced by the Conservatives and supported by the Liberals, including this Prime Minister.

If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-policing of black bodies?

If the Prime Minister truly believes that black lives matter, will he commit to ensuring that there are race-based data to make better decisions? Will he commit to ensuring that there's access to education and to health resources? The Prime Minister has the power to do all these things right now. The Prime Minister simply needs to get it done. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, then similarly the Prime Minister must commit today to ending the racial profiling of indigenous people, the over-policing of indigenous people and the over-incarceration of indigenous people.

    <node id="1. The Liberal Party of Canada has supported seniors in Quebec and Canada during the COVID-19 crisis by providing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provides a taxable benefit of $2,000 every 4 weeks for up to 28 weeks to eligible workers who have stopped working or whose work hours have been reduced due to COVID-19.&#10;2. The Liberal Party has also implemented the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) program to protect jobs and encourage employers to re-hire workers previously laid off as a result of COVID-19, which covers 75% of an employee's wages up to $847 per week.&#10;3. The wage subsidy program is being managed to ensure fair distribution by being available to all sectors of the economy, protecting employees across the country who are working for businesses facing a reduction in revenue of 30% or more. However, it has been noted that the Liberal Party took money through the emergency wage subsidy program, and between 75 and 100 employees were receiving wages subsidized through this program. This has raised questions about how much taxpayers' money has been taken from the emergency wage subsidy program and will be used as election loot for the Liberal Party of Canada.&#10;4. There have not been any specific measures mentioned in the transcript that focus solely on supporting seniors in Quebec and Canada during the COVID-19 crisis, other than the general benefits provided by the CERB and CEWS programs." />

We have made transfers of $500million, that's halfabillion dollars, because of the recent COVID-19 crisis. We will continue to work with the provinces in the long term. But, for the moment, we are working on the emergency situation in which we find ourselves.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, the Conservatives have backtracked on the wage subsidy, and I congratulate them for that. Who pays for the part of the wage subsidy program that will be going into the coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, since this crisis began, we have made investments to protect jobs and workers, including accountants, human resources managers and receptionists. We are in the process of ensuring that people with all kinds of jobs in all kinds of organizations will be able to keep those jobs.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Yves-Franois Blanc" />

It can therefore be inferred that Canada is a creature of the provinces and that the provinces are not creatures of Canada. Could the Prime Minister read his answer to this question: who pays for the health transfers to the provinces?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, we have a country with a number of levels of government working together to serve Canadians. In times of crisis, but also in good times, Canadians expect that their governments will work together to provide the services and the care that they need. That is exactly what we are doing.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet&#10;Content: Let me remind the Prime Minister that all the provinces and Quebec are asking for increased and recurring health transfers that are unconditional and sustainable.

Some hon. members: Oh, oh!&#10;Speaker: Mr. Alain Therrien&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, I know that they think its funny to pilfer taxpayers money from government coffers. But that is not our style. The Liberal Party took money through the emergency wage subsidy program. I would just like to know how many people work for the Liberal Party of Canada.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau&#10;Content: I do not know how many people work for the Liberal Party, but I can say that the emergency wage subsidy is for all sectors of the economy. That is how we can protect employees across the country who are working for businesses facing a reduction in revenue of 30% or more.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Alain Therrien&#10;Content: They have 157MPs and they have known for two weeks that we are working on the wage subsidy. Not one member wondered how many people work for them. They are too busy helping themselves to the cookie jar. In an article in La Presse on May25, Liberal Party spokesman Braeden Caley said that between 75and 100employees were receiving wages subsidized through this program. Is that correct?&#10;Speaker: Hon." />
    <node id=" Mr. Alain Therrien&#10;Content: I would actually say that they want to have enough money for their next election campaign. I would like to know how much taxpayers' money has been taken from the emergency wage subsidy program and will be used as election loot for the Liberal Party of Canada. How much money have you taken from the program?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau&#10;Content: The emergency wage subsidy program allows us to protect 75% of the income that employees were earning before the crisis, to a maximum of $847. This is important for them and, of course, very important for our economy.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Alain Therrien&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, since I am not getting an answer, let me share with you the very simple calculation I cobbled together. One hundred employees at $847 a week is $340,000a month. That is the amount of taxpayers' money that the Liberal Party is putting into its pockets. If we multiply that amount by threethat's three months, since it started on March15we get over $1million.

Who is going to pay for the fact that one company has been chosen by a closed call for tender? One company has been awarded a private contract, probably a foreign multinational, probably for 2021, while we are perfectly capable of doing the work in Quebec and in Canada.

About 90,000surgical masks bound for the Quebec City UHC were stolen from the Toronto airport. As we all know, these masks are critical in the fight against COVID-19. Has the minister called for an investigation? When are we going to find out what happened to those stolen masks that were bound for Quebec?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

Pierre Poilievre&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, it turns out, according to Department of Finance officials, that less than 3% of Canada's recently added debt since March is for terms of more than five years.

John Ware played a crucial role in establishing the ranching industry in Alberta, while Josiah Henson overcame slavery to become a successful businessman in Ontario.

Current examples of racism and discrimination: Despite these contributions, Black Canadians and other racial minorities still face systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, including racial profiling in policing.

Indigenous people and Black people are disproportionately incarcerated, reflecting a biased justice system.&#10;3.

He would go on to become a teacher in British Columbia, once again serving with excellence to try to make a better world for the next generation. Throughout our history, black Canadians have put their lives on the line for their fellow Canadians, bravely serving around the world in our armed forces. While there are many things we can point to in our history with pride, that is not to say that we have a perfect record, nor that we are immune to the threat of racism or that anti-black racism is just an American problem. Canada has had its own dark episodes of racism that cannot be ignoredsadly, not just in our past. Every day, there are people who experience discrimination or racism in some form. Throughout this pandemic, we have seen a troubling spike in anti-Asian racism. No one should be attacked in their community or targeted on the bus because of the colour of their skin. Nor should places of worship be broken into and desecrated, like the synagogue in Montreal. The Conservatives condemn all acts of anti-semitism, racism and discrimination." />
    <node id=" However, I hope it has mostly sparked conversations. Racism is real, painful and unacceptable.  No one should ever feel unsafe because of the colour of their skin, especially around police officers who have a duty and a responsibility to uphold the law for all. Here in Canada, we are fortunate to live in a country that is welcoming, tolerant and inclusive. Canada was a beacon of freedom to so many escaping slavery during the U.S. Civil War. Our nation has benefited immensely from great Canadians who overcame prejudices and discrimination to serve their communities and make Canada a better country: Lincoln Alexander, elected as a Conservative in 1968, was the first black member of Parliament and went on to become the first black cabinet minister; John Ware was born into slavery in South Carolina but, following the American Civil War, was a leading figure in bringing the first cattle to Alberta and spearheading the ranching industry that would become the backbone of the province; Josiah Henson escaped slavery to become a thriving businessman in Ontario; and of course, Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia.

I think about Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto and the calls for justice for Regis. A black trans woman was killed in suspicious circumstances in an interaction with the police. I think about Stewart Kevin Andrews, a young indigenous man killed in an interaction with the police in Winnipeg. The anger and frustration are about this: How many more people need to die before there's action? How many more speeches will be made? How many more protests need to happen before something is done? How many more times will people plead to breathe? How many more times will they plead to live? What we're talking about is basic human dignity. How many more voices have to ask, demand, plead, beg for basic human dignity? People are angry. They're feeling like enough is enough. Why do they need to keep on asking? Why do black people, why do indigenous people need to keep on asking to be treated like humans? Why? You know, people are done with pretty speeches," />

Mr. Chair, building upon historic investments that we made in the last Parliament in law enforcement dealing with guns and gangs, we took the important next step in our promise to strengthen Canada's gun control by prohibiting weapons that many in the law enforcement community, including the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, have said have no place in our communities. There is much more to do. We will build on these early steps by strengthening our work and our laws at the border, by taking steps to prevent the theft and criminal diversion of guns and also by making significant investments in kids, families and communities where the conditions give rise to gun violence right across Canada.

Mr. Chair, as parliamentarians, our greatest responsibility is to keep Canadians safe. During the previous Parliament, our government made significant investments in the CBSA and the RCMP, and provided funds to provinces and territories to invest in programs that combat gun and gang violence and support our communities in providing positive alternatives for youth engagement and activities. On May 1, our government banned assault-style weapons. This is something that we pledged to do during the last federal election and something that victims' groups, law enforcement and everyday Canadians called on for decades, but we must know that we need to take more action to keep our communities safe.

    <node id="1. Enduring values and institutions: Canada is built on solid values such as respect for democracy, rule of law, and fundamental human rights, which attract immigrants seeking a better life. These values have created strong democratic institutions that uphold equality and freedom for all.&#10;&#10;2. Diversity as a result of strength: The transcript highlights that diversity is not the source of Canada's strength but rather the outcome of its strong foundation based on freedom. This freedom allows individuals to preserve their cultural traditions, live peacefully with others, and enjoy equality under the law regardless of race or ethnic background.&#10;&#10;3. Economic freedom: Canada offers economic freedom, which enables hard work to pay off and provides people the ability to work towards their dreams and choose their own path in life. This economic freedom has helped build Canada into a prosperous nation.&#10;&#10;4. Rich history of minority contributions: The transcript highlights the significant historical contributions made by Black Canadians and other racial minorities, which have shaped Canada's culture, economy, and society. These contributions demonstrate that Canada has long been a country that values diversity, inclusion, and opportunity for all.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition of systemic issues: The transcript acknowledges the existence of systemic prejudice, discrimination, and violence against people of color in Canada. By recognizing these challenges, Canada can work towards addressing them and ensuring equality under the law for all its citizens.&#10;&#10;6. Data collection on COVID-19 impacts: The importance of collecting disaggregated data on the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities is emphasized in the transcript. This will help identify disparities, ensure resources are allocated fairly, and contribute to a more equitable society.&#10;&#10;In summary, Canada's strength and diversity stem from its commitment to enduring values, democratic institutions, freedom, economic opportunities, historical recognition of minority contributions, and the willingness to address systemic issues that may affect racial minorities." />
    <node id=". We are all created in the image and likeness of God, and because of that, we are all equal. An infinite value exists in each one of us.  Canada is an incredibly diverse country. Canada is a nation of immigrants that stands on the traditional territories of first nations, Inuit and Mtis people. Waves of newcomers have come to Canada for a better life because our country is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights. Everyone comes here because Canada is built on solid values, democratic institutions, and respect for the rule of law, as well as for fundamental, universal human rights. We must absolutely protect these values, because they are what sets us apart. They allow Canada to offer what so many other countries simply cannot. There are those who say that diversity is our strength, and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture. Diversity is the result of our strength, and our strength is and always has been our freedom. It is the freedom for people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and" />
    <node id=" the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and the economic freedom that so many governments around the world deny their people. It is that economic freedom that ensures that hard work pays off. It gives people the ability to work towards their dreams and choose their own path in life. Together, generations of Canadians who trace their roots back to countries around the world have built Canada to truly the greatest country on earth, the true north strong and free. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and around the world. Minority rights must be protected. Freedom of religion must be protected. Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest must be protected. As John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, free to choose those who shall govern my country. This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair" />

There is no further information on who covered the costs.&#10;2. There has been no call for an investigation regarding the theft of 90,000 surgical masks bound for Quebec City UHC.

Why couldn't the Prime Minister have shown some backbone and banned Huawei a year ago?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon.

International relations: The Canadian government is also considering international relations, particularly with countries like China, in their discussions. This includes taking into account the detention of Canadians in China, false information about COVID-19, blocked exports, and actions against Hong Kong citizens.&#10;3. Collaboration with allies: Robust discussions are underway with Five Eyes partners, including the United States, to align on a decision regarding Huawei's involvement in 5G development in Canada.&#10;4. Access to innovative technology: The Canadian government wants to ensure that Canadians have access to the most beneficial 5G technology, balancing security and innovation.&#10;&#10;These factors, along with expert advice and counsel from security and intelligence communities, are being taken into account as the Canadian government continues their review of 5G technologies and their economic and security implications before making a decision on Huawei." />

Justin Trudeau, has acknowledged the issue of systemic discrimination in the justice system, particularly affecting Indigenous and black people, and has committed to working on reducing incarceration rates and improving the fairness of the justice system.&#10;2. Regarding data collection, the Prime Minister mentioned that investments have been made to Statistics Canada for better data collection in a disaggregated manner, including information related to COVID-19 impacts on racialized communities.&#10;3. However, when specifically asked about ending racial profiling against black people in Canada, the Prime Minister did not provide a clear yes or no answer. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if he has committed to addressing this issue directly.&#10;4. Although other government representatives have made commitments related to training and data collection, these do not directly address the issues of over-policing and over-incarceration as specifically requested by Mr. Jagmeet Singh.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the Prime Minister has acknowledged systemic discrimination in the justice system and made some commitments related to data collection, it is unclear if he has explicitly committed to addressing over-policing and over-incarceration of black and Indigenous people and collecting disaggregated data on COVID-19 impacts on racialized communities." />

That's for the protection of all Canadians. You mentioned travelling back and forth across the border. If the travel is deemed essential, that is an exception, but if it is not deemed essential, then a person must go into quarantine for 14 days.

She has also committed to transferring 60% of the AgriRecovery program funds for pork and beef producers, regardless of whether provinces choose to contribute their 40% share. However, a specific date for this transfer cannot be given as it depends on each province's implementation.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Minister Bibeau is committed to making major changes to the business risk management programs, her ability to meet the July deadline is dependent on factors beyond her control, such as provincial contributions and cooperation.

Supplementary unemployment benefits, or SUBs, give employers the opportunity to enhance their employees' employment insurance benefits when they need to temporarily lay them off. A number of companies, including Soprema in Drummond, have done so with the guarantee that the government would maintain the SUB terms when employment insurance is converted to the CERB. However, surprise, surprise, when the employees applied for the CERB in May, they found that they did not meet the criteria because the amount of SUBs they have received exceeded $1,000, the CERB income limit. In addition, they must reimburse the CERB because they found that they were not eligible for it. So, what does the Minister of Finance intend to do to correct his error?&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We will pause for a second. We have a point of order on the floor.

Harry Jerome was a successful Olympic athlete who won a bronze medal in 1964 and later became a teacher. Lincoln Alexander served as the first black member of Parliament and the first black cabinet minister. John Ware played a crucial role in establishing the ranching industry in Alberta, while Josiah Henson overcame slavery to become a successful businessman in Ontario. Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia.&#10;2. Current examples of racism and discrimination: Despite these contributions, Black Canadians and other racial minorities still face systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, including racial profiling in policing. The transcript highlights recent incidents of violence involving the police and people of color. Indigenous people and Black people are disproportionately incarcerated, reflecting a biased justice system.&#10;3. Data collection on COVID-19 impacts: There is a need for collecting disaggregated data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities, particularly indigenous and black people.

The two &quot;dangerous, invisible viruses&quot; that the speaker identifies are COVID-19 and race-based hatred, hate speech, and anti-black racism. The speaker emphasizes that while Canadians are dealing with the visible threat of the coronavirus pandemic, they must also acknowledge and address the less visible but equally dangerous virus of systemic racism and discrimination against Black individuals in Canada.&#10;2. It is important for Canadians to acknowledge that black lives matter because anti-black racism and violence against Black people are ongoing issues in Canada, not just in the United States. The speaker highlights specific cases of police violence and calls for justice for Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black woman killed in Toronto, as well as a Black trans woman who died in suspicious circumstances during an interaction with the police. The speaker emphasizes that people are angry and frustrated about the ongoing violence and discrimination faced by Black individuals, and the need for concrete actions and commitments to end these unjust practices.">

Historical contributions by Black Canadians: Throughout Canada's history, Black Canadians have made significant contributions. Harry Jerome was a successful Olympic athlete who won a bronze medal in 1964 and later became a teacher. Lincoln Alexander served as the first black member of Parliament and the first black cabinet minister. John Ware played a crucial role in establishing the ranching industry in Alberta, while Josiah Henson overcame slavery to become a successful businessman in Ontario. Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia.&#10;2. Current examples of racism and discrimination: Despite these contributions, Black Canadians and other racial minorities still face systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, including racial profiling in policing. The transcript highlights recent incidents of violence involving the police and people of color. Indigenous people and Black people are disproportionately incarcerated, reflecting a biased justice system.&#10;3.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in response to Scheer, expressed gratitude towards military personnel helping in long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario. He acknowledged the difficult situation and mentioned that having military personnel in these facilities is not a long-term solution. Instead, they are working on better long-term solutions with Quebec. In relation to Legault's request for military personnel to stay until fall, Trudeau did not directly address this request but implied that their presence is not a long-term solution.">

He acknowledges that the recent horrific reports of police violence against Black individuals in the United States are not isolated incidents but rather a lived reality for many people of color due to systems that perpetuate inequality and injustice. By addressing these issues in today's proceedings, Trudeau recognizes the need for change and understanding of the challenges faced by racial minorities in Canada and elsewhere." target="1. The two &quot;dangerous, invisible viruses&quot; that the speaker identifies are COVID-19 and race-based hatred, hate speech, and anti-black racism. The speaker emphasizes that while Canadians are dealing with the visible threat of the coronavirus pandemic, they must also acknowledge and address the less visible but equally dangerous virus of systemic racism and discrimination against Black individuals in Canada.&#10;2. It is important for Canadians to acknowledge that black lives matter because anti-black racism and violence against Black people are ongoing issues in Canada, not just in the United States. The speaker highlights specific cases of police violence and calls for justice for Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black woman killed in Toronto, as well as a Black trans woman who died in suspicious circumstances during an interaction with the police. The speaker emphasizes that people are angry and frustrated about the ongoing violence and discrimination faced by Black individuals, and the need for concrete actions and commitments to end these unjust practices.">

Enduring values and institutions: Canada is built on solid values such as respect for democracy, rule of law, and fundamental human rights, which attract immigrants seeking a better life. These values have created strong democratic institutions that uphold equality and freedom for all.&#10;&#10;2. Diversity as a result of strength: The transcript highlights that diversity is not the source of Canada's strength but rather the outcome of its strong foundation based on freedom. This freedom allows individuals to preserve their cultural traditions, live peacefully with others, and enjoy equality under the law regardless of race or ethnic background.&#10;&#10;3. Economic freedom: Canada offers economic freedom, which enables hard work to pay off and provides people the ability to work towards their dreams and choose their own path in life. This economic freedom has helped build Canada into a prosperous nation.&#10;&#10;4. Rich history of minority contributions: The transcript highlights the significant historical contributions made by Black Canadians and other racial minorities, which have shaped Canada's culture, economy, and society. These contributions demonstrate that Canada has long been a country that values diversity, inclusion, and opportunity for all.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition of systemic issues: The transcript acknowledges the existence of systemic prejudice, discrimination, and violence against people of color in Canada. By recognizing these challenges, Canada can work towards addressing them and ensuring equality under the law for all its citizens.&#10;&#10;6. Data collection on COVID-19 impacts: The importance of collecting disaggregated data on the impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities is emphasized in the transcript. This will help identify disparities, ensure resources are allocated fairly, and contribute to a more equitable society.&#10;&#10;In summary, Canada's strength and diversity stem from its commitment to enduring values, democratic institutions, freedom, economic opportunities, historical recognition of minority contributions, and the willingness to address systemic issues that may affect racial minorities.">

Justin Trudeau, has acknowledged the issue of systemic discrimination in the justice system, particularly affecting Indigenous and black people, and has committed to working on reducing incarceration rates and improving the fairness of the justice system.&#10;2. Regarding data collection, the Prime Minister mentioned that investments have been made to Statistics Canada for better data collection in a disaggregated manner, including information related to COVID-19 impacts on racialized communities.&#10;3. However, when specifically asked about ending racial profiling against black people in Canada, the Prime Minister did not provide a clear yes or no answer. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed if he has committed to addressing this issue directly.&#10;4. Although other government representatives have made commitments related to training and data collection, these do not directly address the issues of over-policing and over-incarceration as specifically requested by Mr. Jagmeet Singh.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the Prime Minister has acknowledged systemic discrimination in the justice system and made some commitments related to data collection, it is unclear if he has explicitly committed to addressing over-policing and over-incarceration of black and Indigenous people and collecting disaggregated data on COVID-19 impacts on racialized communities.">

There is much more to do. We will build on these early steps by strengthening our work and our laws at the border, by taking steps to prevent the theft and criminal diversion of guns and also by making significant investments in kids, families and communities where the conditions give rise to gun violence right across Canada.

Ban on Certain Firearms: The Canadian government has recently banned certain firearms, including some that were not designed for hunting or sport shooting but for military use. This ban has been criticized by some, including the member for Medicine Hat-Cardston-Warner, for prioritizing political interests over the safety and protection of Canadians.&#10;2. Lack of Notice on Banned Firearms List Changes: Mr. Glen Motz questioned why there was no notice given to firearm owners, retailers, or the police regarding changes to the banned firearms list. Hon. Bill Blair stated that the RCMP continues to do diligence to keep Canadians safe by updating the list, but no formal notices have been provided.&#10;3.

We are all created in the image and likeness of God, and because of that, we are all equal. An infinite value exists in each one of us.  Canada is an incredibly diverse country. Canada is a nation of immigrants that stands on the traditional territories of first nations, Inuit and Mtis people. Waves of newcomers have come to Canada for a better life because our country is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights. Everyone comes here because Canada is built on solid values, democratic institutions, and respect for the rule of law, as well as for fundamental, universal human rights. We must absolutely protect these values, because they are what sets us apart. They allow Canada to offer what so many other countries simply cannot. There are those who say that diversity is our strength, and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture. Diversity is the result of our strength, and our strength is and always has been our freedom. It is the freedom for people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and">

This freedom allows individuals to preserve their cultural traditions, live peacefully with others, and enjoy equality under the law regardless of race or ethnic background.&#10;&#10;3.

It is that economic freedom that ensures that hard work pays off. It gives people the ability to work towards their dreams and choose their own path in life. Together, generations of Canadians who trace their roots back to countries around the world have built Canada to truly the greatest country on earth, the true north strong and free. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and around the world. Minority rights must be protected. Freedom of religion must be protected. Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest must be protected. As John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, free to choose those who shall govern my country. This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair">

Respect for Wet'suwet'en Territory: The petition calls on the government to respect the territory of the Wet'suwet'en nation, which likely implies acknowledging their land rights and title claims. This refers to the ongoing dispute between the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs and the Canadian government over natural resource projects on their traditional lands without proper consultation or consent.&#10;2. Dismantle RCMP Exclusion Zones: The petition also requests the dismantling of RCMP exclusion zones that have been established within Wet'suwet'en territory during enforcement actions related to pipeline construction. This demand asks for the removal of police presence and security measures, which would enable the hereditary chiefs and their supporters to access their lands freely and continue their opposition to the projects if they so choose.&#10;&#10;These actions are based on principles from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action, which emphasize respecting indigenous self-determination and land rights.">

Justin Trudeau, has acknowledged the issue of systemic discrimination in the justice system, particularly affecting Indigenous and black people, and has committed to working on reducing incarceration rates and improving the fairness of the justice system.&#10;2. Regarding data collection, the Prime Minister mentioned that investments have been made to Statistics Canada for better data collection in a disaggregated manner, including information related to COVID-19 impacts on racialized communities.&#10;3. However, when specifically asked about ending racial profiling against black people in Canada, the Prime Minister did not provide a clear yes or no answer.

If a firearm that was not on the original prohibited list was transferred since May 1 and now that firearm appears on that prohibited list, are those transfers subject to a criminal prosecution?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

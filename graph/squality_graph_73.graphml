    <node id="1. The desperate measure needed to remove Jonathan's swollen boots is cutting them off, as they resist every attempt to tug them off.&#10;2. Jonathan reacts to this suggestion with alarm, thinking that they are planning to cut off his feet, not his boots. When he realizes the truth, he threatens violence against anyone who tries to remove his boots." />

A dozen girls volunteered with a rush. &quot;Hoist!&quot; said Billy. They lifted him like a sleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom, where they deposited him on the bed.&#10; &#10; Ann said to Olga; &quot;Help me with these boots.&quot; But they resisted every tug. &quot;It's no use,&quot; groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her bright yellow hair back from her eyes. &quot;His feet have swollen. We'll have to cut them off.&quot;&#10; &#10; At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.&#10; &#10; &quot; Cut off whose feet? &quot; he cried in alarm.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not your feet, silly,&quot; said Ann. &quot;Your boots.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Lay a hand on those boots,&quot; he scowled; &quot;and I'll make me another pair out of your hides. They set me back a week's salary.&quot; Having delivered himself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.&#10; &#10; Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. &quot;And this,&quot; she" />
    <node id=" decided, he wanted to sleep. &quot;What?&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?&quot; repeated Billy.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not outside the space docks.&quot;&#10; &#10; They expelled their breath, but not for an instant did they relax the barrage of their eyes. He shifted position in embarrassment. The movement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering lassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;You look exhausted,&quot; said Ann.&#10; &#10; Jonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. &quot;Just tired,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars.&quot; Indeed it was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His eyelids drooped lower and lower.&#10; &#10; &quot;First it's tobacco,&quot; said Olga; &quot;now he wants to sleep. Twenty-seven girls and he wants to sleep.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He is asleep,&quot; said the green-eyed blonde.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in his arms.&#10; &#10; &quot;Catch a hold,&quot; said Billy, pushing back from the table.

    <node id=" woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table until the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was called Billy.&#10; &#10; &quot;Quiet!&quot; She shrieked in her loud strident voice. &quot;Let him be. He can't go anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs rest.&quot; She turned to Jonathan who had shrunk down in his chair. &quot;How about some roast?&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot; He pushed back his plate with a sigh. &quot;If I only had a smoke.&quot;&#10; &#10; Olga gave her unruly black hair a flirt. &quot;Isn't that just like a man?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; said the green-eyed blonde. &quot;I've forgotten what they're like.&quot;&#10; &#10; Billy said, &quot;How badly wrecked is your ship?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's strewn all over the landscape,&quot; he replied sleepily.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is there any chance of patching it up?&quot;&#10; &#10; He considered the question. More than anything else, he decided, he wanted to sleep. &quot;What?&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?&quot; repeated Billy.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" his sleeve.&#10; &#10; &quot;Suppose the rest should come,&quot; he said in an embarrassed voice.&#10; &#10; &quot;They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch.

He began to recover his nerve.&#10; &#10; She said, &quot;You're the best looking thing.&quot; She rumpled his hair. &quot;I can't keep my eyes off you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. &quot;Ouch!&quot; He winced. He had forgotten his sore muscles.&#10; &#10; &quot;I forgot,&quot; said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.&#10;&quot;You're hurt.&quot;&#10; &#10; He pulled her back down. &quot;Not so you could notice it,&quot; he grinned.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well!&quot; came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. &quot;We're all glad to hear that!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground.

    <node id=" ground. He jerked around. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their features were grim. He said: &quot;I don't feel so well after all.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It don't wash,&quot; said Billy. &quot;It's time for a showdown.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take her stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a menacing angle. She said in an angry voice: &quot;He's mine. I found him. Leave him alone.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where do you get that stuff?&quot; cried Olga. &quot;Share and share alike, say I.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We could draw straws for him,&quot; suggested the green-eyed blonde.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look here,&quot; Jonathan broke in. &quot;I've got some say in the matter.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You have not,&quot; snapped Billy. &quot;You'll do just as we say.&quot; She took a step toward him.&#10; &#10; Jonathan edged away in consternation.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's going to run!&quot; Olga shouted.&#10; &#10; Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the plain. His nerves were jumping like" />
    <node id=" hair. A green cloth was wrapped around her sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her brown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table cloth at one time in its history.&#10; &#10; &quot;A man!&quot; she breathed. &quot;By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a man!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't let him get away!&quot; cried Ann.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hilda!&quot; the brunette shrieked. &quot;A man! It's a man!&quot;&#10; &#10; A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off warily.&#10; &#10; Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: &quot;Don't let him get away!&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way he had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the canyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the bend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.&#10; &#10; Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer weight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up bodily, started up the canyon" />
    <node id="1. The situation when Jonathan accidentally knocks over Ann Clotilde is that they are sitting together on the ground, and he suddenly leaps up when he hears the approach of Billy and the other girls. In his haste, he forgets about Ann's proximity and inadvertently dumps her to the ground.&#10;2. The girls appear with grim faces after hearing Jonathan's claim of not being hurt because they have noticed that he winced in pain when he put his arm around Ann Clotilde, indicating that he is indeed injured. However, when he downplays his injury and tries to reassure them, they become suspicious and confront him, demanding a showdown. This is why Jonathan feels intimidated and attempts to flee, leading to the girls binding and carrying him back to their camp." />
    <node id=" the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of the valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.&#10; &#10; They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind a promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming ordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew the girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp like a bag of meal.&#10; &#10; The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner reappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded and rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded him of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He looked away hastily.&#10; &#10; Someone hailed them from the space ship.&#10; &#10; &quot;We've caught a man,&quot; shrieked one of his captors.&#10; &#10; A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.&#10; &#10; &quot;A man!&quot; screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She had green eyes. &quot;We're rescued!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No. No,&quot; Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. &quot;He was wrecked like" />
    <node id=" nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer weight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up bodily, started up the canyon chanting: &quot; He was a rocket riding daddy from Mars. &quot; He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.&#10; &#10; Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the spaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had been broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of his left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy, tough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from mortification.&#10; &#10; He said, &quot;Put me down. I'll walk.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You won't try to get away?&quot; said Ann.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being held aloft by four barbarous young women.&#10; &#10; &quot;Let him down,&quot; said Ann. &quot;We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a break.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between two husky females, who og" />
    <node id="1. Jonathan, or &quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; has been stranded on an asteroid and is being rescued by a doctor and a young man from a spaceship.&#10;2. However, he refuses their help and instead chooses to return to the asteroid.&#10;3. The reason for his decision is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that he has become accustomed to living on the asteroid and has even started to enjoy it.&#10;4. He mentions that he only came back to the asteroid because of cigarettes, and when the doctor tells him that it will be three years before another spaceship comes by, Jonathan doesn't seem to mind.&#10;5. The doctor also compares Jonathan's desire to stay on the asteroid to an &quot;aesthetic movement&quot; during the medieval period, where people fled to the wilderness to escape temptation.&#10;6. This further suggests that Jonathan has found a sense of peace and solitude on the asteroid that he does not want to give up.&#10;7. Additionally, when Jonathan arrives back at the asteroid, he is greeted by a group of girls who are living there as well, which may also contribute to his decision to stay." />
    <node id=" return, young man?&quot;&#10; &#10; He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant. He said, &quot;You might report my accident to Universal. Tell them to stop one of their Jupiter-bound freighters here when the asteroid swings back in the space ways. I'll have a load for them.&quot;&#10; &#10; Inside the ship, Doctor Boynton moved over to a round transparent port hole. &quot;What a strange fellow,&quot; he murmured. He was just in time to see the castaway, loaded like a pack mule, disappear in the direction from which he had come.&#10; &#10; Robinson Crusoe was going back to his man (?) Friday—all twenty-seven of them." />
    <node id=" broke into a grin. He said, &quot;Do any of you know how to grow tobacco?&quot;&#10; &#10; They glanced at each other in perplexity.&#10; &#10; &quot;I like it here,&quot; continued Jonathan. &quot;I'm not going back.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What?&quot; cried the three explorers in one breath.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm going to stay,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I only came back here after the cigarettes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it back in the space lanes,&quot; said Doctor Boynton. &quot;You don't possibly expect to be picked up before then!&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobacco seed, and cigarettes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Odd.&quot; Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. &quot;Though if I remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits during the medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to the wilderness to escape the temptation of women .&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan laughed outright.&#10; &#10; &quot;You are sure you won't return, young man?&quot;&#10; &#10; He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant. He said, &quot;You might" />
    <node id="&#10; She said: &quot;Get down!&quot; Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her stomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared after her stupidly. &quot;Get down!&quot; she reiterated in a furious voice.&#10; &#10; He let himself to his hands and knees. &quot;Ouch!&quot; he said. He felt like he was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled after the girl. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. &quot;Centaurs!&quot; she said. &quot;I didn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which leads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach the hills we'll be safe.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, personally,&quot; she replied, &quot;I never saw a Centaur until I was wrecked on this asteroid.&quot; She reached the ravine, crawled head foremost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom, winced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the hills. Jonathan, groaning at each step" />
    <node id=" as he panted up, &quot;pilot for Universal. I was wrecked.&quot;&#10; &#10; A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed mustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a yellow composition holder. He said, &quot;I'm Doctor Boynton.&quot; He had a rich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. &quot;We are members of the Interstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a cursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr. Fawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning when we sighted the wreck.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I say,&quot; said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim, energetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun gingerly, respectfully. &quot;We're a week overdue now,&quot; he said. &quot;If you have any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd best be getting them aboard.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jonathan's face broke into a grin. He said, &quot;Do any of you know how to grow tobacco?&quot;&#10; &#10; They glanced at each other in perplexity.&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The girls who tackled, bound, and captured Jonathan are a group of amazons. This is evident in the text as they are referred to as such multiple times, and they possess exceptional strength, live in a canyon camp, and are armed with spears. They also display typical Amazonian behavior as described in mythology, such as their suspicion towards Jonathan's injury claim, their demand for a showdown, and their willingness to physically confront him when he tries to escape." />
    <node id=" the strength of her grip. &quot;They'd kill you,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I can sneak back,&quot; he insisted stubbornly. &quot;They might loot the ship. I don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley tobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on Ganymede.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot;&#10; &#10; He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly detached her hand.&#10; &#10; The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.&#10;&quot;We are going to the camp,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from under her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.&#10; &#10; A voice shouted: &quot;What's going on there?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward them from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was barefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around her sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her brown eyes wide in surprise. He thought" />

They paused on a bluff overlooking the prairie.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look!&quot; cried Ann pointing over the edge.&#10; &#10; A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first, Jonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up they resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to his own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.&#10; &#10; &quot;Centaurs!&quot; Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who reared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they hurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly like the neighing of horses.&#10; &#10; Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem of the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred to him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller" />
    <node id="1. Jonathan Fawkes, a well-known and tough man in the spaceways, experienced humiliation when he was overpowered by a group of Amazonian women. These women tackled, bound, and captured him, which was especially embarrassing for him since he had a reputation for being a man to be left alone. Despite his size, strength, and history of physical confrontations, this group of girls managed to trounce him. He meekly trudged between two of the women, feeling more powerless than ever before. The fact that they were young women made his defeat even more humiliating, as he had never been defeated by females prior to this incident." />
    <node id=" long? We lost track of time.&quot; She didn't take her eyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self conscious. She said, &quot;I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw your space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a heap. I thought you were dead.&quot; She stooped, picked up a spear.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about four miles,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think so,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space ship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They were the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he realized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown of concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.&#10; &#10; On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward them.&#10; &#10; She said: &quot;Get down!&quot; Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her stomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared" />
    <node id=" into the ship,&quot; she said. &quot;The man must be starved.&quot;&#10; &#10; He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the wrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of the floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His feet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the Thirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.&#10; &#10; With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang forward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be seated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like a captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar settings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan Fawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild women.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; As the meal boisterously progressed, he regained sufficient courage to glance timidly around. Directly across the table sat a striking, grey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She looked to him like a stenographer. He watched horrified as she seized a whole roast fowl, tore it apart with her fingers" />
    <node id="The Happy Castaway&#10; &#10; &#10; BY ROBERT E. McDOWELL&#10; &#10; Being space-wrecked and marooned is tough enough. But to face the horrors of such a planet as this was too much.

He was flat on his back, and a girl was bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the girl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The sky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his bunk aboard the space ship.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're not dead?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've some doubt about that,&quot; he replied dryly. He levered himself to his elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was pert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is—is anything broken" />
    <node id="1. The situation is that Jonathan has been invited to join a group of women for dinner. He finds their behavior strange and discomforting, as evidenced by his horrified reaction when one of the women tears apart a roast fowl with her fingers and gnaws on a leg. She catches him staring at her and rolls her eyes at him, further adding to his discomfort.&#10;2. The women make suggestive comments and proposals towards Jonathan, such as inviting him to go fishing or gathering fruit with them. He becomes increasingly uncomfortable and tries to distance himself from the situation by saying &quot;Heaven forbid.&quot;&#10;3. Billy, the rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounds on the table until the dishes dance in an attempt to calm the uproar at the table. From Jonathan's perspective, he has gathered that her name is Billy.&#10;4.

    <node id="Yes, based on the story, it is revealed that the spaceship carrying the twenty-seven girls did not collide with a meteor as reported, but instead crashed on an asteroid. This occurred three years ago, and since then, they have been stranded on the asteroid, thinking they are far from civilization." />

Otherwise there was no sign of life: just he and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast rolling prairie.&#10; &#10; &quot;I was going to explain,&quot; he heard her say. &quot;We think that we are on an asteroid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We?&quot; he looked back at her.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.

    <node id="1. Based on Olga's reaction to Jonathan's injury and his subsequent actions, it is clear that Jonathan has not been praying for his current situation during the last three years. Instead, Olga's statement is ironic, highlighting the contrast between what they had hoped for and what actually happened.&#10;2. Despite initially feeling safe and even enjoying being waited on by the twenty-seven amazons, Jonathan ultimately feels humiliated by his dependence on them. He wishes he could carry it off in a more cavalier fashion, but he recognizes that he is not the type to do so. The fact that his captors are young women further adds to his embarrassment. However, he also considers hiding out in the hills or joining the centaurs as alternatives, indicating that he has accepted his new reality and is looking for ways to cope with it." />
    <node id=" delivered himself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.&#10; &#10; Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. &quot;And this,&quot; she cried &quot;is what we've been praying for during the last three years.&quot;&#10; &#10; The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a cane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced all around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he presumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits and berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He walked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be hanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.&#10; &#10; He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by twenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it off in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the shade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be years before they were rescued.&#10; &#10; As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join the centaurs" />
    <node id="1. The man who was caught is named Jonathan, but he is also referred to as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; by one of the girls. When the group of girls who have been living on the asteroid after their spaceship crashed there discover him, they are overjoyed because they believe they are rescued. They hail him and one of them even screams, &quot;We're rescued!&quot; This suggests that they have been stranded on the asteroid for some time and have not seen another person since the crash.&#10;2. When Jonathan is first discovered, he is not initially willing to accept help from the doctor and young man who arrive in a spaceship to rescue him. Despite being stranded on the asteroid for an unspecified amount of time, he has become accustomed to living there and even seems to enjoy it. This is evident when he becomes excited at the prospect of growing tobacco on the asteroid.&#10;3. The fact that Jonathan is greeted by a group of girls when he returns to the asteroid may also contribute to his decision to stay. When he arrives, they are bathing in a stream near a crashed space liner, which suggests that they have also been stranded there for some time.&#10;4. It's worth noting that while the story refers to Jonathan as &quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; it does not explicitly state that he was previously shipwrecked or stranded on a desert island. However, the parallels between his situation and that of the fictional character Robinson Crusoe are clear, as he has been living alone on an uninhabited asteroid for an extended period of time." />

    <node id="1. Based on the story, it is not specified what Jonathan Fawkes has been praying for during the last three years. However, Olga's reaction to his injury suggests that he had not been praying for his current situation.&#10;2. After becoming an invalid due to his injury, Jonathan Fawkes feels both humiliated and safe being waited on by twenty-seven amazons. On one hand, he is embarrassed by his dependence on them, especially since they are young women. On the other hand, he recognizes that as long as he is an invalid, he is safe from any harm. He also wishes he could carry off his dependence in a more cavalier fashion, but realizes that it is not in his nature to do so." />
    <node id="Jonathan is acting uncomfortable because he is not used to the romantic advances of Ann Clotilde and is trying to navigate this unfamiliar social situation while also dealing with his injury. He tries to downplay his pain and dismiss his injury, but when Ann continues to flirt with him, he becomes even more uncomfortable. This is evident when he winces again after putting his arm around her and when he tries to change the subject by mentioning the possibility of the rest of the group arriving. Despite this, Ann persists in her advances, which contributes to Jonathan's discomfort. Additionally, Jonathan may also feel guilty for leading Ann on, as he knows he has no intention of staying with her and the other girls on the asteroid." />

Ann Clotilde placed the flat of her hand on his chest and shoved. &quot; Ooof! &quot; he grunted. He sat down rather more forcibly than he had risen.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't get up because of me,&quot; she informed him. &quot;It's my turn to cook, but I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do you know that you are irresistible?&quot; She seized his shoulders, stared into his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a hungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms.

Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?&quot; he panted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Too rough. They're like horses,&quot; she said. &quot;Nothing but a goat could get around in the hills.&quot;&#10; &#10; The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a gorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon of sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the crevices and floor of the canyon.&#10; &#10; They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped away, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her arm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied it to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded him.

Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the uniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.&#10;&quot;Hold on,&quot; he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette package, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.&#10; &#10; &quot;You got a cigarette?&quot; he asked without much hope.&#10; &#10; The girl shook her head. &quot;We ran out of tobacco the first few months we were here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where are you going?&quot; cried Ann in alarm.&#10; &#10; He said, &quot;I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the freighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her grip. &quot;They'd kill you,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I can sneak back,&quot; he insisted stubbornly. &quot;They might" />
    <node id="1. No, Jonathan is not asleep at the table. He is slumped forward across the table with his head buried in his arms, but based on the conversation that follows, it seems that he is only dozing off or in a highly fatigued state, rather than actually being asleep. The girls notice his exhaustion and try to take care of him by offering him food and rest, and Billy explicitly tells the others to let him be and sleep because he can't go anywhere for a few days due to his wrecked spaceship. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jonathan is in a state where he would fall into a deep sleep in such a public and unsafe setting." />
    <node id="1. The big rawboned brute of a girl who led Jonathan to the dining salon is named Billy. Based on her appearance and actions, we can infer that she is strong and assertive, as evidenced by her ability to physically capture Jonathan and bring him to the dining salon. She also displays leadership qualities, such as when she pounds on the table to calm down the uproar at the dinner table. Furthermore, she shows concern for Jonathan's well-being, telling the other girls to let him be and sleep since he cannot go anywhere for a few days due to his wrecked spaceship. Overall, Billy appears to be a no-nonsense, practical, and caring individual, albeit with a rough exterior." />
    <node id="1. The girls, specifically the group of amazons, have control over Jonathan's actions as they are the ones who tackle, bind, and carry him back to their camp. They also later demand a showdown and physically confront him when he tries to escape.&#10;2. After Jonathan flees, the girls decide who gets to pursue him based on their initial reactions and proximity to the situation. Ann Clotilde, Hilda, and a third girl are the first ones to spot Jonathan and react with excitement, leading them to chase after him. Other girls then join in the pursuit as they hear the commotion and see what's happening." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, Jonathan is astonished to find a group of girls living on the asteroid because he had previously thought that he was alone there. He is also surprised by their increased strength, as they are able to carry him on their shoulders with ease.&#10;2. Additionally, the sighting of a space liner on the asteroid further contributes to Jonathan's astonishment. This suggests that other people have also been stranded on the asteroid, and it raises questions about how they arrived there and what happened to their spaceship.&#10;3. The fact that the space liner appears to be crashed and damaged is also significant, as it indicates that something has gone wrong during their journey. This may explain why the group of girls have been stranded on the asteroid for some time.&#10;4. Overall, Jonathan's astonishment can be attributed to the unexpected and unusual nature of these discoveries, which challenge his previous assumptions about the asteroid and its inhabitants." />
    <node id="The conflict between Jonathan and the girls stems from their suspicion towards him, as they are not convinced by his injury claim and demand a showdown. This makes Jonathan feel intimidated, leading him to attempt to flee. However, the girls overpower him and carry him back to their camp. The source of the conflict can be traced back to the beginning when the girls tackle and bind Jonathan, suspecting that he is not injured as he claims.&#10;&#10;Jonathan is eager to flee from the girls because he feels intimidated by their behavior towards him. They demand a showdown, physically confront him when he tries to escape, and make suggestive comments and proposals towards him. This overly familiar and aggressive treatment makes Jonathan uncomfortable, leading him to want to distance himself from the situation. Additionally, the girls' Amazonian characteristics, such as their exceptional strength and suspicious nature, contribute to Jonathan's desire to flee.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jonathan's astonishment at discovering a group of girls living on the asteroid, along with the sighting of a crashed space liner, adds to his eagerness to leave the situation. He is overwhelmed by these unexpected and unusual discoveries, which challenge his previous assumptions about the asteroid and its inhabitants.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jonathan's desire to flee from the girls can be attributed to their aggressive and overly familiar behavior towards him, as well as his astonishment at the discovery of other inhabitants on the asteroid." />
    <node id="1. Jonathan jumped to his feet and abandoned Ann Clotilde when he noticed the other girls approaching because he was feeling uncomfortable with Ann's romantic advances and trying to navigate this unfamiliar social situation. He also may have felt guilty for leading her on, as he knew he had no intention of staying with her and the other girls on the asteroid. When he saw the group of girls approaching, he saw an opportunity to escape the situation.&#10;2. Jonathan said he wasn't hurt despite wincing in pain earlier because he was trying to downplay his injury and dismiss it in order to reassure the girls and avoid a confrontation with them. He also may have been attempting to hide his injury from them, as it would indicate that he is vulnerable and unable to defend himself. However, when he winced again after putting his arm around Ann Clotilde, the girls became suspicious and confronted him, leading to the events that followed." />

    <node id="Yes, the twenty-seven girls were actually transported to an asteroid instead of heading to the Jupiter colonies as brides for the colonists.

    <node id="1. The spaceship carrying twenty-seven girls, who were enlisted to be brides for colonists on Jupiter, crashed on what they thought was an asteroid three years ago. They lost track of time and had been stranded there since then.&#10;2. After the crash, they discovered that they had landed on a large prairie with a volcano in sight. The girls managed to survive by hunting and gathering food.&#10;3. When Jonathan Fawkes' spaceship crashed on the same asteroid, one of the girls, Ann Clotilde, found him and brought him back to their camp, which was about four miles away.&#10;4. It is later revealed that they were actually on a previously undiscovered planet, which explained why they had not been rescued after three years. The sighting of a space liner on the asteroid further contributes to the astonishment and raises questions about how it arrived there." />
    <node id="1. Ann, the leader of the group of girls living on the asteroid, objects to Jonathan returning to their spaceship to retrieve cigarettes because she is concerned for his safety.&#10;2. She warns him that the journey through the vacuum of space could be dangerous and put his life at risk.&#10;3. This suggests that Ann values Jonathan's life and well-being and does not want to see him come to harm.&#10;4. It also shows that she is willing to prioritize his safety over his desire for cigarettes, highlighting her caring and protective nature." />

This is evident when he becomes excited at the prospect of growing tobacco on the asteroid.&#10;3. The fact that Jonathan is greeted by a group of girls when he returns to the asteroid may also contribute to his decision to stay. When he arrives, they are bathing in a stream near a crashed space liner, which suggests that they have also been stranded there for some time.&#10;4. It's worth noting that while the story refers to Jonathan as &quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; it does not explicitly state that he was previously shipwrecked or stranded on a desert island. However, the parallels between his situation and that of the fictional character Robinson Crusoe are clear, as he has been living alone on an uninhabited asteroid for an extended period of time.">

The man who was caught is named Jonathan, but he is also referred to as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; by one of the girls. When the group of girls who have been living on the asteroid after their spaceship crashed there discover him, they are overjoyed because they believe they are rescued. They hail him and one of them even screams, &quot;We're rescued!&quot; This suggests that they have been stranded on the asteroid for some time and have not seen another person since the crash.&#10;2. When Jonathan is first discovered, he is not initially willing to accept help from the doctor and young man who arrive in a spaceship to rescue him. Despite being stranded on the asteroid for an unspecified amount of time, he has become accustomed to living there and even seems to enjoy it. This is evident when he becomes excited at the prospect of growing tobacco on the asteroid.&#10;3. The fact that Jonathan is greeted by a group of girls when he returns to the asteroid may also contribute to his decision to stay. When he arrives, they are bathing in a stream near a crashed space liner, which suggests that they have also been stranded there for some time.&#10;4. It's worth noting that while the story refers to Jonathan as &quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; it does not explicitly state that he was previously shipwrecked or stranded on a desert island. However, the parallels between his situation and that of the fictional character Robinson Crusoe are clear, as he has been living alone on an uninhabited asteroid for an extended period of time.">

    <node id="The story suggests that Tobias Whiting, the father of Mary Whiting, disappeared during the fourth night of their journey in the desert, taking Steve's unicopter. The reason for his disappearance is not explicitly stated in the text, but there are clues that suggest he may have betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji.&#10;&#10;Firstly, it is mentioned that Tobias Whiting had profits tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, and thanks to an unspecified event, he will never see it again. This suggests that he had some sort of dealings with the Kumaji.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Steve and Mary spot the unicopter from a long way off, and Steve realizes that Tobias Whiting must have reached the Kumaji encampment by now if he escaped the crash-landing without injury. This further suggests that Tobias Whiting intentionally flew the unicopter to the Kumaji encampment.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Mary expresses her hatred for her father, saying that he is not asleep and is &quot;thinking&quot; about something. Steve then springs at Tobias Whiting, intending to kill him but ultimately deciding to hobble him instead. This suggests that Tobias Whiting's disappearance was a deliberate act of betrayal.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the text does not explicitly state the reason for Tobias Whiting's disappearance, it strongly implies that he betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10; Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.&#10; &#10; The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.&#10; Their water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to&#10; reach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of&#10; fatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be&#10; done for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always&#10; slaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still&#10; four hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their&#10; backs.&#10; &#10; And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking&#10; Steve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the&#10; turbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but&#10; had assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had&#10; done so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.&#10; &#10; &quot;But why?&quot; someone asked. &quot;Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the&#10; day before said: &quot;It's no secret Whiting" />
    <node id=" , the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the&#10; sands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.&#10; Steve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond&#10; grew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out&#10; here with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her&#10; heart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in&#10; order to regain his fortune.&#10; &#10; On the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and&#10; made their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had&#10; expected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he&#10; escaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the&#10; Kumaji encampment by now.&#10; &#10; &quot;It doesn't seem badly damaged,&quot; Mary said.&#10; &#10; The platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of&#10; the rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Steve said. &quot;It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it&#10; all right.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To go—to them?&quot;" />
    <node id=" eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.&quot;&#10; &#10; The refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.&#10; They hardly seemed to be moving at all. &quot;Is my aunt all right?&quot; Steve&#10; said. She was the only family he remembered.&#10; &#10; Tobias Whiting shook his head slowly. &quot;I hate to be the one to tell you&#10; this. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died&#10; from the poisoned water last night.&quot;&#10; &#10; For a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was&#10; pity—pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death.&#10; Sadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; The caravan reached them then. The first person Steve saw was a girl.&#10; She wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face—it would be a&#10; pretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized—was etched with&#10; lines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. &quot;Who is he, Dad?&quot; the&#10; girl said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Young Cantwell. Remember?&quot;&#10; &#10; So this was Mary Whiting, Steve" />
    <node id="&#10; that.&quot; He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. &quot;But I&#10; never got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be&#10; poor again. We could have been rich.&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve asked, &quot;What happened to all your profits?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll&#10; never see it again.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to&#10; her. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding&#10; and hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up&#10; to recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias&#10; Whiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of&#10; them, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming.&#10; &#10; But Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was&#10; comforting and reassuring.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.&#10; &#10; The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day." />
    <node id=" help but the yelling was kept to a minimum so only one&#10; guard, the man outside, came....&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Darkness in the Kumaji encampment.&#10; &#10; Far off, a lone tribesman singing a chant old as the desert.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you asleep?&quot; Mary asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Steve said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Dad is. Listen to the way he's breathing—like a baby. As if—as if he&#10; wasn't going to betray all our people. Oh, I hate him, I hate him!&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve crawled to where the older man was sleeping. Tobias Whiting's&#10; voice surprised him. &quot;I'm not asleep. I was thinking. I—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm going to kill you,&quot; Steve said very softly, and sprang at Whiting.&#10; He paused, though. It was a calculated pause, and Whiting cried out as&#10; Steve had hoped he would. Then his hands found the older man's throat&#10; and closed there—not to kill him but to keep him from crying out again.&#10; &#10; Sand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside.&#10; Steve got up, met him halfway, felt" />

I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm&#10; sorry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What can we do?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;North?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;North.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And if by some miracle we find him?&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve said nothing. The answer—capture or death—was obvious. But you&#10; couldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you?&#10; &#10; As it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own&#10; efforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were&#10; spotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on&#10; their thlots . Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel&#10; aside. &quot;They'd kill us,&quot; he said. &quot;We can only surrender.&quot;&#10; &#10; They were hobbled and led painfully across the" />

Additionally, the Kumaji have always resented the colony's presence, as it means one less oasis for their own sustenance." />
    <node id="afternoon. &quot;Three folks died,&quot; the Kumaji&#10; said in his almost perfect English, &quot;from the poisoning of the well. The&#10; well was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,&#10; and go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?&quot; Oasis City,&#10; built at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the&#10; surface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,&#10; was almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of&#10; trackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....&#10; &#10; &quot;They have to,&quot; the old man said. &quot;And they have to hurry. Men, women&#10; and children. The Kumaji are after them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Steve felt irrational hatred then. He thought it would help if he could&#10; find some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way&#10; he felt, he knew, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists,&#10; trekking across a parched wilderness—to the safety of Oasis City—or&#10; death.&#10; " />
    <node id=" It was too dark for&#10; effective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all&#10; night and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any&#10; direction. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.&#10; &#10; Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,&#10;&quot;Steve, do you have to tell them?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We can tell them this,&quot; Steve said. &quot;Your father died a hero's death,&#10; sending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And not—not what he'd planned to do at first.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can&#10; make a mistake, can't he?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I love you, Steve. I love you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all&#10; reach Oasis City in safety.&#10; &#10; With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Steve gave him another drink. &quot;You still haven't told me what happened.&quot;&#10; Actually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century&#10; Earth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were&#10; sought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The&#10; Kumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life&#10; on the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one&#10; oasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,&#10; Kumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about&#10; the raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,&#10; so far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had&#10; suggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since&#10; a colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,&#10; almost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.&#10; &#10; &quot;When did it happen?&quot; Steve demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Last night.&quot; It was now midafternoon. &quot;Three folks died,&quot; the Kumaji&#10; said in his almost perfect English, &quot;from the poisoning of the well. The&#10; well was the" />

They're my people. I've been away too long.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Say, you're young Cantwell, aren't you? Now I remember.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, I'm Steve Cantwell.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm not going anyplace, young fellow.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But you can't stay here, without any good water to drink, without—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm staying,&quot; the old man said, still without self-pity, just&#10; matter-of-factly. &quot;The Earth folks have no room for me and I can't blame&#10;'em. The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good,&#10; long life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll&#10; need every extra strong right arm they can get.

Already, after only one day's travel, Steve&#10; could see that some of the people were spent and exhausted and had to&#10; ride on camelback. They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five&#10; hundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them....&#10; &#10; &quot;Hullo!&quot; Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding&#10; clumsily through the sand toward him. &quot;Cantwell's the name,&quot; Steve said.&#10;&quot;I'm one of you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bleak hostility in his face, the man approached. &quot;Cantwell. Yeah, I&#10; remember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh,&#10; no. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing&#10; here now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?&quot;&#10; &#10; The bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias&#10; Whiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a&#10; boy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in" />

He urged Steve to hurry because the desert wind would wipe out any evidence of their presence, making it harder for the Kumaji to track them down.&#10;2. Steve gave his canteen to the old man as a gesture of goodwill before he left. The old man had mentioned that he was staying behind and wanted to stay in his home village, so Steve may have felt pity for him and wanted to help him in some way. Additionally, Steve had just rinsed out his mouth with water from the canteen after coming into contact with poisoned sand, so the water in the canteen would have been especially valuable to the old man.&#10;3. Steve reacted to this information by quickly getting himself airborne and flying away without looking back at the deserted village or the old man again. He may have felt a sense of urgency to warn his people about the Kumaji's intentions and to get them to safety as soon as possible." />

His purple skin,&#10; which had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.&#10; &#10; Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost&#10; spasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the&#10; canteen and said:&#10; &#10; &quot;What happened here?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They're gone. All gone.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, but what happened?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Kumaji—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're Kumaji.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is my town,&quot; the old man said. &quot;I lived with the Earthmen. Now&#10; they're gone.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But you stayed here—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To die,&quot; the old man said, without self-pity. &quot;I'm too old to flee, too&#10; old to fight, too old for anything but death.

If you thought you were&#10; doing it for me....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've made up my mind,&quot; Tobias Whiting said.&#10; &#10; Mary turned to Steve, in despair. &quot;Steve,&quot; she said. &quot;Steve.&#10; Do—whatever you have to do. I—I'll understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve didn't answer her. Wasn't Whiting right now? he thought.

He'd talk if they did that....&#10; &#10; Then silencing Whiting wasn't the answer. But the Kumajis had one&#10; willing prisoner and two unwilling ones. They knew that.

He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's&#10; house. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the&#10; saline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table&#10; was set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last&#10; night's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.&#10; &#10; The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of&#10; the moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth—too&#10; late for anything.&#10; &#10; He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring&#10; at him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard&#10; scurried away.&#10; &#10; &quot;Earthman!&quot; a quavering voice called.&#10; &#10; Steve ran toward the sound.

I want to stay. This is my home. It's the only home&#10; I'll ever have. Good luck, young fellow.&quot;&#10; &#10; Slowly, Steve walked to his unicopter. It was nothing more than a small&#10; metal disk on which to stand, and a shaft with four turbo-blades. It&#10; could do sixty miles an hour at an elevation of two thousand feet.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Steve turned the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse ran back&#10; to the old man and gave him his canteen, turning away before it could be&#10; refused and striding quickly back to the unicopter and getting himself&#10; airborne without looking at the deserted village or the old man again.&#10; &#10; The old man's voice called after him: &quot;Tell the people ... hurry ...&#10; Kumaji looking for them to kill ... desert wind ought to wipe" />
    <node id="Tobias Whiting's bitterness and defeat were likely caused by the loss of his fortune and business with the Kumajis, as well as the impending attack on the colony by the Kumaji. His perception of Steve Cantwell's return was not positive, as he saw it as Steve coming to &quot;crow at their wake&quot; and rubbed in the fact that Steve left the colony to get an education while Tobias had to stay and lose everything. This is shown when he says &quot;I remember you... Had to go off to Earth to get yourself educated. What are you doing here now on that fancy aircraft of yours?&quot;" />
    <node id=", who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a&#10; boy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in&#10; his eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in&#10; his mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was&#10; well-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a&#10; big muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had&#10; hardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve&#10; Cantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the&#10; Kumajis, and had grown rich—by colony standards—at his business. Now,&#10; Steve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the&#10; others—either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a&#10; new colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation.&#10; Perhaps that explained his bitterness.&#10; &#10; &quot;So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.&quot;&#10; &#10; The refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.&#10; They" />
    <node id="Who is he, Dad?&quot; the&#10; girl said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Young Cantwell. Remember?&quot;&#10; &#10; So this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten&#10; years ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly.&#10; She was a woman now....&#10; &#10; &quot;Steve Cantwell?&quot; Mary said. &quot;Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I—I'm&#10; sorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your&#10; aunt. If there's anything I can do....&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a&#10; slim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time&#10; like this was little short of amazing, especially since it was&#10; completely genuine.&#10; &#10; He appreciated it.&#10; &#10; Tobias Whiting said: &quot;Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get&#10; along with the Kumaji.

Oh, yes!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can get her out of here, Cantwell?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I think so,&quot; Steve said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them—due south. The Earthmen are&#10; heading due south. They'll go—south. They won't find the caravan.&#10; You'll—all—get away. If it's—what you want, Mary.&quot;&#10; &#10; She leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: &quot;Isn't&#10; there anything we can do for him?&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve shook his head. &quot;But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to&#10; deceive them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll live long enough,&quot; Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he&#10; would. &quot;Luck to—all of you. From a—very foolish—man....&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Steve took Mary's hand and pulled" />
    <node id="Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the&#10; day before said: &quot;It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money—with the&#10; Kumaji.&quot;&#10; &#10; None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying&#10; anything, and Steve squeezed her hand.&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, wait a minute,&quot; one of Whiting's friends said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait, nothing.&quot; This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the&#10; colony. &quot;I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for&#10; that money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the&#10; Kumaji were looking for us, to kill us?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's what I was told,&quot; Steve said.&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Gort went on relentlessly. &quot;Then this is what I figure must&#10; have happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally&#10; decided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's&#10;'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the&#10; Kumaji," />
    <node id="Based on the story, Tobias Whiting agreed to reveal that the Earthmen were heading due south in exchange for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter Mary. He made a deal with the Kumaji to trade his inside information for their lives and freedom. However, he wanted to make sure it was going to the right people before revealing it. Whiting's intention was to deceive the Kumaji into believing that they were heading in a different direction than where the caravan actually was, giving them a chance to escape and avoid capture." />
    <node id=". The guard stabbed out&#10; awkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,&#10; but Steve hardly heard him.&#10; &#10; When the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was&#10; either dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours. Steve&#10; had never killed a man before, had never in violence and with intent to&#10; kill attacked a man....&#10; &#10; &quot;Steve!&quot;&#10; &#10; It was Mary, calling his name and crying.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's Dad. Dad was—hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad—&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out&#10; Tobias Whiting's pain-contorted face.&#10; &#10; &quot;My stomach,&quot; Whiting said, gasping for breath. &quot;The pain....&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He&#10; couldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He&#10; touched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying&#10; softly.&#10; &#10; &quot;You two ...&quot; Whiting gasped. &quot;You" />

Mary....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We came for you, Dad,&quot; she said coldly. &quot;To stop you.

I have information to trade, sure. But I want to&#10; make sure it's going to the right people. I want to get our....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Dad!

    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information about who poisoned the well or why. However, based on the context and the fact that the Kumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life on the desert, it is strongly implied that they are responsible for poisoning the well. This action was likely taken in an effort to drive out the Earth colony, which had settled in the oasis and was using up resources that the Kumaji also relied on for their own survival. The poisoning of the well ultimately led to the desertion of the town and Steve's delayed return to his boyhood home from Earth." />

Is the most callous&#10; traitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?&#10; That at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.&#10; &#10; &#10; Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when&#10; he reached the village.&#10; &#10; He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,&#10; parching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's&#10; unicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred&#10; miles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'&#10; second planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like&#10; a magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.&#10; &#10; He walked among the buildings" />

He also wants to use his &quot;extra strong right arm&quot; to help them in their journey to Oasis City or face the dangers together.&#10;2. When the old man says he has no room with the Earth folks or the Kumaji, he means that he is not welcome to return to the colony on Earth and he cannot stay with the Kumaji tribe because they will kill him for being a renegade. He has lived a good life and has no regrets, choosing to stay behind in the desert village to face death instead of fleeing with the colonists." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it is strongly implied that Tobias Whiting betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji and left in Steve's unicopter (helicopter) without saying goodbye to Mary because he had struck a deal with the Kumaji to trade the location of the Earthmen's valuable resource (presumably water or some other essential resource) for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter. However, Whiting wanted to make sure that he was revealing the information to the right people before fully committing to the deal.&#10;&#10;Whiting's intention was to deceive the Kumaji into believing that the Earthmen were heading in a different direction than where they actually were, giving them a chance to escape and avoid capture. However, it is unclear whether Whiting made it to the Kumaji encampment or not, as he disappeared during the fourth night of their journey in the desert.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that there is some debate among the characters in the story about why Whiting left. Jeremy Gort, a friend of Whiting's and former mayor of the colony, suggests that Whiting left to try and reclaim his lost fortune with the Kumaji, and that he may have crash-landed or crashed in the desert trying to reach them. However, this theory is unlikely given the evidence presented in the story.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide a definitive answer as to why Whiting left in Cantwell's helicopter without saying goodbye to Mary, it strongly implies that he did so as part of a betrayal to the Kumaji in order to trade information about the Earthmen's valuable resource for his life and safety." />

He won't get far.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He'll crash in the desert?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Crash or crash-land,&quot; Steve said.&#10; &#10; Mary sobbed, and bit her lip, and was silent.&#10; &#10; &quot;We've got to stop him,&quot; Gort said. &quot;And fast. If he gets to the Kumaji,&#10; they'll send down a raiding party and we'll be finished. We could never&#10; fight them off without the protection of our village. Near as I can&#10; figure, there's a Kumaji base fifty miles due north of here. Whiting&#10; knows it too, so that's where he'll be going, I figure. Can't spare more&#10; than a couple of men to look for him, though, in case the Kumaji find&#10; us—or are led to us—and attack.&quot;&#10; &#10; Steve said, &quot;I should have taken something out of the 'copter every&#10; night, so it couldn't start. I'll go.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mary came forward boldly. &quot;I have to go. He's my father. If he crashed&#10; out there, he may be hurt" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Tobias Whiting disappeared in the middle of the night with Steve's unicopter because he likely betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji. The clues that suggest this include his previous business dealings with a Kumaji moneylender and the fact that he had struck a deal with them to trade information about the Earthmen's valuable resource for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter.&#10;&#10;Whiting may have taken the unicopter to reach the Kumaji encampment, where he planned to reveal the location of the Earthmen's resource in exchange for his safety. He wanted to ensure that he was revealing the information to the right people before fully committing to the deal, which is why he left without saying goodbye to Mary.&#10;&#10;Whiting's intention was to deceive the Kumaji into believing that the Earthmen were heading in a different direction than where they actually were, giving them a chance to escape and avoid capture.

    <node id="1. When a Kumaji guard tries to attack Steve and Mary in their tent, Steve physically fights back by grappling with the guard and squeezing his neck with his fingers until the guard stops moving, realizing that he has to kill the guard or be killed by him.&#10;2. Steve decides not to pursue the fleeing colonists despite the danger and the old man's warning because it is too dark for effective pursuit and the wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail. He also knows that they can go in any direction, making it impossible to track them down.&#10;3. Steve reacts to the information about the Kumaji looking for the people and wanting to kill them by quickly getting himself airborne and flying away without looking back at the deserted village or the old man again, feeling a sense of urgency to warn his people about the Kumaji's intentions and to get them to safety as soon as possible.&#10;4. Steve is determined to go after the fleeing colonists despite the danger and the old man's warning because they are his people and he feels a sense of responsibility towards them, having been away for too long.

The poisoning of the well ultimately led to the desertion of the town and Steve's delayed return to his boyhood home from Earth.&#10;6. When faced with the threat of torture by the Kumajis, Steve considers silencing Tobias Whiting to prevent him from revealing any information. However, he ultimately decides against it because he knows that the Kumajis have one willing prisoner and two unwilling ones, and if Whiting yells for help but the yelling is kept to a minimum, only one guard would come to investigate. This would allow Steve to overpower the guard and escape with Mary." />
    <node id=" out again.&#10; &#10; Sand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside.&#10; Steve got up, met him halfway, felt the jarring contact of their bodies.&#10; The pike came up dimly in the darkness, the point scraping against&#10; Steve's ribs as the guard lunged awkwardly. Steve's fingers sought the&#10; thick-muscled neck, clamped there—squeezing.&#10; &#10; The guard writhed. His feet drummed the sand. With one hand he stabbed&#10; out wildly with the unwieldy pike. There was a cry from Mary and the&#10; guard managed a low squawking noise. Outside, the rest of the camp&#10; seemed undisturbed. There was death in Steve's strong tightening&#10; fingers. There had to be death there. Death for the Kumaji guard—or&#10; death for the fleeing Earthmen, who had lost one colony and must seek&#10; another.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; They fell together on the sand, the guard still struggling. Steve&#10; couldn't release his throat to grab the pike. The guard stabbed out&#10; awkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,&#10; but Steve hardly heard him.&#10; " />
    <node id="Tobias Whiting has become bitter and resentful due to the loss of his fortune and business with the Kumajis, as well as their impending attack on the colony. He also feels defeated and humiliated by the fact that Steve Cantwell, who left the colony to get an education, returned just in time to witness his downfall.&#10;&#10;Whiting's reluctance to flee with the other colonists to Earth or another outworld might be explained by the deal he made with the Kumaji. In exchange for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter Mary, he revealed that the Earthmen were heading due south, intending to deceive the Kumaji into believing they were going in a different direction than where the caravan actually was. He may have hoped that by betraying the colonists, he could secure a better fate for himself and his daughter with the Kumaji. However, when he realized that Steve suspected him of treachery, he fled and stole the unicopter to reach the Kumaji encampment." />
    <node id="The water in the Earth colony's well has been poisoned, making it undrinkable for the colonists. This is strongly implied to have been done by the Kumaji tribesmen, who have always resented the colony's presence and competition for resources in the desert wasteland where both groups live. The protagonist, Steve, discovers the bitterness of the water when he tries to drink from the well after returning to his boyhood home from Earth. Upon tasting the poisoned water, Steve's lips and mouth become paralyzed, forcing him to rinse his mouth out with sand and water from his canteen. This situation leaves the colonists with no choice but to walk all the way to Oasis City despite the harsh conditions and pursuit by the Kumaji tribesmen in order to survive." />
    <node id=" Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like&#10; a magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.&#10; &#10; He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on&#10; his gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the&#10; single well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick&#10; house, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof&#10; now, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed&#10; in a Kumaji raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest&#10; time as a boy.&#10; &#10; He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked&#10; as he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and&#10; brought the ladle to his lips.&#10; &#10; He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.&#10; &#10; Poisoned.&#10; &#10; He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost&#10; gagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen&#10; and rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact" />
    <node id="1. Steve is determined to stay in his home and warn the villagers because they are his people and he feels a sense of responsibility towards them, having been away for too long. He wants to use his &quot;extra strong right arm&quot; to help them in their journey to Oasis City or face the dangers together.&#10;2. Despite the old man's attempts to dissuade him and the fact that Steve lacks weapons, he is determined to warn the villagers because he has just learned from the old man that the Kumaji are looking for the people and want to kill them. He wants to hurry and warn his people so they can reach safety.&#10;3. The old man's statement about having no room with the Earth folks or the Kumaji, and his decision to stay behind in the desert village to face death, may also influence Steve's determination to stay and warn the villagers. He may feel a sense of urgency to help his people and ensure their safety, as the old man has chosen to stay behind and face death.&#10;4. Additionally, Steve gives his canteen to the old man as a gesture of goodwill before he leaves, which may indicate that he feels pity for the old man and wants to help him in some way. This further highlights Steve's sense of responsibility and desire to help those in need, even if it means putting himself in danger." />
    <node id="Based on Jeremy Gort's understanding of Tobias Whiting's mindset and the Kumaji's intentions, it is likely that Whiting attempted to reach the Kumaji encampment in Steve Cantwell's unicopter to trade information about the Earthmen's valuable resource for his life and safety. However, Gort suggests that if Whiting knew the Kumaji, then he would have known that they were not looking to make deals but rather to kill the Earthmen.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is possible that Whiting's attempt to reach the Kumaji was met with hostility, and he may have been killed or captured by them. Alternatively, Whiting may have realized the futility of his mission and decided to flee, possibly crashing the unicopter in the process.&#10;&#10;Overall, based on Jeremy Gort's understanding of Whiting's mindset and the Kumaji's intentions, it is likely that Whiting's attempt to reach the Kumaji encampment did not end well for him." />
    <node id="1. Alert the colony and organize a search party to find Tobias Whiting: Since Whiting is likely lost or injured in the desert, it is crucial to inform the colony and gather a group of people to search for him as soon as possible. The longer they wait, the greater the risk of him succumbing to dehydration, heatstroke, or other hazards of the desert.&#10;2. Share information about Whiting's dealings with the Kumaji: To ensure that everyone is informed and can make decisions based on all available facts, it is essential to share what is known about Whiting's business dealings with the Kumaji moneylender and his potential betrayal of the caravan. This information will help the colony understand why Whiting may have left and assist in determining the best course of action to locate him.&#10;3. Approach the Kumaji with caution: If it is suspected that Whiting has betrayed the caravan, it is vital to approach any interaction with the Kumaji cautiously. They may be expecting an attack or retaliation from the colonists and could react negatively if they feel threatened. It would be best to send a small, peaceful delegation to negotiate with the Kumaji and gather information about Whiting's whereabouts.&#10;4. Investigate the Kumaji encampment: If negotiations with the Kumaji prove unfruitful or unsuccessful, it may be necessary to investigate their encampment further to locate Whiting. This should be done with caution and stealth, as an open attack could result in unnecessary casualties and hinder efforts to find Whiting.&#10;5. Prepare for potential conflict: If the Kumaji are found to be harboring Whiting or hostile towards the colonists, it may be necessary to prepare for defensive measures or even a retaliatory strike. However, this should always be a last resort and every effort should be made to resolve the situation peacefully to avoid further loss of life.&#10;6. Continue searching until Whiting is found: Regardless of whether he is located through negotiations with the Kumaji or through independent search efforts, it is crucial to continue looking for Whiting until he is found. The longer he remains missing, the greater the risk to his safety and well-being." />
    <node id="1. Steve and Mary are undertaking a journey northward across the sand towards the Kumaji settlement, where they believe Mary's father, Tobias Whiting, may be. They are concerned about encountering Kumaji patrols, as the Kumajis have been looking for the people in the caravan and want to kill them. Steve and Mary set out on this journey after Mary promises to do whatever Steve asks her to if they find her father trying to sell them out to the Kumajis." />

I promise.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's good enough for me,&quot; Steve said.&#10; &#10; A few minutes later, armed with atorifles and their share of the food&#10; and water that was left, Steve and Mary set out northward across the&#10; sand while the caravan continued east. Fear of what they might find&#10; mounted.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; The first night, they camped in the lee of low sandhills. The second&#10; night they found a small spring with brackish but drinkable water. On&#10; the third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji&#10; settlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or thlotback , the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the&#10; sands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.&#10; Steve and" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Tobias Whiting went off in Steve Cantwell's unicopter (helicopter) without saying goodbye to Mary because he had likely struck a deal with the Kumaji to trade the location of the Earthmen's valuable resource for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter. Whiting wanted to make sure that he was revealing the information to the right people before fully committing to the deal, which is why he left without saying goodbye to Mary.&#10;&#10;Whiting's likely destination is the Kumaji encampment, where he planned to reveal the location of the Earthmen's resource in exchange for his safety.

    <node id="1. Tobias Whiting may have betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji: The story provides several clues that suggest Tobias Whiting had dealings with the Kumaji and may have struck a deal with them to reveal the location of the Earthmen's valuable resource in exchange for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter. He likely took Steve's unicopter to reach the Kumaji encampment and reveal the information.&#10;2. Whiting wanted to deceive the Kumaji: By leaving in the middle of the night without saying goodbye to Mary, Whiting may have intended to deceive the Kumaji into believing that the Earthmen were heading in a different direction than where they actually were, giving them a chance to escape and avoid capture.&#10;3. Jeremy Gort's theory is unlikely: While Jeremy Gort suggests that Whiting left to try and reclaim his lost fortune with the Kumaji, this theory is unlikely given the evidence presented in the story. It is more likely that Whiting had struck a deal with the Kumaji and left in Steve's unicopter to reveal the information.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the story does not provide a definitive answer as to why Tobias Whiting left in Steve's unicopter without saying goodbye to Mary, it strongly implies that he did so as part of a betrayal to the Kumaji in order to trade information about the Earthmen's valuable resource for his life and safety." />
    <node id="1. Steve returned to his boyhood home from Earth to find the town deserted and the well poisoned because he had been away for some time and wanted to reconnect with his people and community. However, he arrived too late to find that the colonists had abandoned the town due to the poisoning of the well, which was strongly implied to have been done by the Kumaji tribesmen in an effort to drive out the colony.&#10;2. The state of the community center and the presence of an old Kumaji man provided a glimmer of understanding for Steve because it allowed him to piece together what had happened in his absence. The old man, who was a resident of the town and had lived with the Earthmen, informed Steve that the Kumaji were responsible for poisoning the well and driving out the colonists. This helped Steve understand the reasons behind the desertion of the town and the danger his people were facing." />
    <node id="1. Steve and Mary must first ensure their own safety and escape from the Kumaji patrols. Since Steve struck Mary's atorifle aside when they were captured, they no longer have a weapon to defend themselves. They need to find a way to either get their weapon back or acquire another one without getting caught.&#10;2. Once they are safe, they should continue their journey northward towards the Kumaji settlement, as they had originally planned. Now that they know Tobias Whiting is alive and has betrayed the colonists, it is crucial for them to find him before he can reveal any more information to the Kumajis.&#10;3. When they find Whiting, Steve and Mary must confront him about his treachery and try to persuade him to redeem himself by helping the colonists instead. Since Whiting betrayed the colonists in exchange for sparing his life and ensuring his daughter's safety, he might be willing to change sides if he believes that Steve and Mary can offer him a better deal or protect him from the Kumajis.&#10;4. If Whiting refuses to help them or they cannot persuade him to change sides, Steve and Mary must find a way to inform the colonists about his betrayal without putting themselves in danger. They could do this by sending a message through another trusted person or using a secret code to communicate with the colonists.&#10;5. Finally, Steve and Mary must ensure their own safety and that of the colonists as they make their way to Oasis City. Steve has already shown his determination to protect his people and use his &quot;extra strong right arm&quot; to help them in their journey. He and Mary must continue to work together and stay vigilant to face any dangers that may come their way." />
    <node id="Steve is considering whether or not to allow Tobias Whiting to reveal information to the Kumajis because he is concerned about the safety of both himself and Mary. If Steve were to silence Whiting, the Kumaji would likely torture them for the information, which Steve knows he cannot endure without breaking and revealing the location of the Earthmen's valuable resource.&#10;&#10;However, simply allowing Whiting to reveal the information is also not an ideal solution, as it would lead to the capture and potential harm of the entire caravan. Steve comes up with a plan to use Whiting's willingness to reveal the information to their advantage by having him yell for help, but keeping the yelling to a minimum so that only one guard comes to investigate. This would allow Steve to overpower the guard and potentially escape with Mary and the other colonists.&#10;&#10;Mary's safety plays a significant role in Steve's decision-making process. He knows that if he were to silence Whiting, the Kumaji would torture Mary for information, which he could not bear to see. Therefore, he must weigh the potential harm that could come to the entire caravan against the risk of harm coming specifically to Mary and himself." />
    <node id="1. The likelihood of Tobias Whiting successfully trading with the Kumaji for his life and safety is low, based on Jeremy Gort's understanding of the Kumaji's intentions. Gort suggests that if Whiting knew the Kumaji, he would have known that they were not looking to make deals but rather to kill the Earthmen. Therefore, it is possible that Whiting's attempt to reach the Kumaji encampment was met with hostility, and he may have been killed or captured by them.&#10;2. It is unclear how far Whiting can travel in Steve Cantwell's helicopter (unicopter) with almost no fuel left. The story does not provide enough information about the helicopter's fuel capacity, how much fuel was left when Whiting took off, or how far the Kumaji encampment is from their location. However, given that Whiting disappeared during the fourth night of their journey in the desert, it can be assumed that he did not travel very far before running out of fuel or encountering other difficulties.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on Jeremy Gort's understanding of the Kumaji's intentions and the story's lack of information about the helicopter's fuel capacity, it is unlikely that Whiting will successfully trade with the Kumaji for his life and safety. Additionally, it is unclear how far Whiting can travel in Steve's helicopter with almost no fuel left." />
    <node id="Steve Cantwell is a man who has returned to the colony where he grew up, after having left several years ago to get an education on Earth. During his visit, he learns of the passing of his aunt, who was one of the colonists affected by the poisoned water supply.

At the time of their reunion, Mary is now a grown woman and shows genuine concern for Steve following the news of his aunt's passing. The depth of their relationship is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is clear that they share a history together and care for each other as old friends or acquaintances." />

    <node id="Tobias Whiting, the father of Mary Whiting, disappeared during the fourth night of their journey in the desert while they were traveling with a caravan. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance suggest that he may have betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji.&#10;&#10;Firstly, it is mentioned that Tobias Whiting had profits tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, and thanks to an unspecified event, he will never see it again. This suggests that he had some sort of dealings with the Kumaji.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Steve and Mary spot the unicopter from a long way off, and Steve realizes that Tobias Whiting must have reached the Kumaji encampment by now if he escaped the crash-landing without injury. This further suggests that Tobias Whiting intentionally flew the unicopter to the Kumaji encampment.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Mary expresses her hatred for her father, saying that he is not asleep and is &quot;thinking&quot; about something. Steve then springs at Tobias Whiting, intending to kill him but ultimately deciding to hobble him instead. This suggests that Tobias Whiting's disappearance was a deliberate act of betrayal.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the text does not explicitly state the reason for Tobias Whiting's disappearance, it strongly implies that he betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji." />
    <node id="During the night ride, Steve and Mary were able to successfully deceive the Kumaji patrols and reach the caravan safely. They decided to tell the caravan that Mary's father, Tobias Whiting, died a hero's death by sending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction, while leaving out his initial plan to sell them out to the Kumajis.

They are concerned about encountering Kumaji patrols, as the Kumajis have been looking for the people in the caravan and want to kill them. When a Kumaji guard invades their tent in the middle of the night, Steve takes desperate measures by attacking the guard with his fists, despite being unarmed. He fights the guard to protect himself and Mary from harm and to prevent the guard from raising an alarm that would alert other Kumajis to their presence.

Alert the colony and organize a search party to find Tobias Whiting: Since Whiting is likely lost or injured in the desert, it is crucial to inform the colony and gather a group of people to search for him as soon as possible. The longer they wait, the greater the risk of him succumbing to dehydration, heatstroke, or other hazards of the desert.&#10;2. Share information about Whiting's dealings with the Kumaji: To ensure that everyone is informed and can make decisions based on all available facts, it is essential to share what is known about Whiting's business dealings with the Kumaji moneylender and his potential betrayal of the caravan. This information will help the colony understand why Whiting may have left and assist in determining the best course of action to locate him.&#10;3.

Prepare for potential conflict: If the Kumaji are found to be harboring Whiting or hostile towards the colonists, it may be necessary to prepare for defensive measures or even a retaliatory strike. However, this should always be a last resort and every effort should be made to resolve the situation peacefully to avoid further loss of life.&#10;6.

He wanted to ensure that he was revealing the information to the right people before fully committing to the deal, which is why he left without saying goodbye to Mary.&#10;&#10;Whiting's intention was to deceive the Kumaji into believing that the Earthmen were heading in a different direction than where they actually were, giving them a chance to escape and avoid capture. However, it is unclear whether Whiting made it to the Kumaji encampment or not, as he disappeared during the fourth night of their journey in the desert.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide a definitive answer as to why Whiting left in Cantwell's helicopter without saying goodbye to Mary, it strongly implies that he did so as part of a betrayal to the Kumaji in order to trade information about the Earthmen's valuable resource for his life and safety.">

Share information about Whiting's dealings with the Kumaji: To ensure that everyone is informed and can make decisions based on all available facts, it is essential to share what is known about Whiting's business dealings with the Kumaji moneylender and his potential betrayal of the caravan. This information will help the colony understand why Whiting may have left and assist in determining the best course of action to locate him.&#10;3. Approach the Kumaji with caution: If it is suspected that Whiting has betrayed the caravan, it is vital to approach any interaction with the Kumaji cautiously. They may be expecting an attack or retaliation from the colonists and could react negatively if they feel threatened. It would be best to send a small, peaceful delegation to negotiate with the Kumaji and gather information about Whiting's whereabouts.&#10;4.

Prepare for potential conflict: If the Kumaji are found to be harboring Whiting or hostile towards the colonists, it may be necessary to prepare for defensive measures or even a retaliatory strike.

Alert the colony and organize a search party to find Tobias Whiting: Since Whiting is likely lost or injured in the desert, it is crucial to inform the colony and gather a group of people to search for him as soon as possible. The longer they wait, the greater the risk of him succumbing to dehydration, heatstroke, or other hazards of the desert.&#10;2. Share information about Whiting's dealings with the Kumaji: To ensure that everyone is informed and can make decisions based on all available facts, it is essential to share what is known about Whiting's business dealings with the Kumaji moneylender and his potential betrayal of the caravan. This information will help the colony understand why Whiting may have left and assist in determining the best course of action to locate him.&#10;3. Approach the Kumaji with caution: If it is suspected that Whiting has betrayed the caravan, it is vital to approach any interaction with the Kumaji cautiously. They may be expecting an attack or retaliation from the colonists and could react negatively if they feel threatened. It would be best to send a small, peaceful delegation to negotiate with the Kumaji and gather information about Whiting's whereabouts.&#10;4. Investigate the Kumaji encampment: If negotiations with the Kumaji prove unfruitful or unsuccessful, it may be necessary to investigate their encampment further to locate Whiting. This should be done with caution and stealth, as an open attack could result in unnecessary casualties and hinder efforts to find Whiting.&#10;5. Prepare for potential conflict: If the Kumaji are found to be harboring Whiting or hostile towards the colonists, it may be necessary to prepare for defensive measures or even a retaliatory strike. However, this should always be a last resort and every effort should be made to resolve the situation peacefully to avoid further loss of life.&#10;6. Continue searching until Whiting is found: Regardless of whether he is located through negotiations with the Kumaji or through independent search efforts, it is crucial to continue looking for Whiting until he is found. The longer he remains missing, the greater the risk to his safety and well-being.">

He may have hoped that by betraying the colonists, he could secure a better fate for himself and his daughter with the Kumaji.

    <edge source="Based on the story, it is strongly implied that Tobias Whiting betrayed the caravan to the Kumaji and left in Steve's unicopter (helicopter) without saying goodbye to Mary because he had struck a deal with the Kumaji to trade the location of the Earthmen's valuable resource (presumably water or some other essential resource) for sparing his life and ensuring the safety of his daughter.

Alert the colony and organize a search party to find Tobias Whiting: Since Whiting is likely lost or injured in the desert, it is crucial to inform the colony and gather a group of people to search for him as soon as possible. The longer they wait, the greater the risk of him succumbing to dehydration, heatstroke, or other hazards of the desert.&#10;2. Share information about Whiting's dealings with the Kumaji: To ensure that everyone is informed and can make decisions based on all available facts, it is essential to share what is known about Whiting's business dealings with the Kumaji moneylender and his potential betrayal of the caravan. This information will help the colony understand why Whiting may have left and assist in determining the best course of action to locate him.&#10;3. Approach the Kumaji with caution: If it is suspected that Whiting has betrayed the caravan, it is vital to approach any interaction with the Kumaji cautiously. They may be expecting an attack or retaliation from the colonists and could react negatively if they feel threatened. It would be best to send a small, peaceful delegation to negotiate with the Kumaji and gather information about Whiting's whereabouts.&#10;4. Investigate the Kumaji encampment: If negotiations with the Kumaji prove unfruitful or unsuccessful, it may be necessary to investigate their encampment further to locate Whiting. This should be done with caution and stealth, as an open attack could result in unnecessary casualties and hinder efforts to find Whiting.&#10;5. Prepare for potential conflict: If the Kumaji are found to be harboring Whiting or hostile towards the colonists, it may be necessary to prepare for defensive measures or even a retaliatory strike. However, this should always be a last resort and every effort should be made to resolve the situation peacefully to avoid further loss of life.&#10;6. Continue searching until Whiting is found: Regardless of whether he is located through negotiations with the Kumaji or through independent search efforts, it is crucial to continue looking for Whiting until he is found. The longer he remains missing, the greater the risk to his safety and well-being.">

Alert the colony and organize a search party to find Tobias Whiting: Since Whiting is likely lost or injured in the desert, it is crucial to inform the colony and gather a group of people to search for him as soon as possible. The longer they wait, the greater the risk of him succumbing to dehydration, heatstroke, or other hazards of the desert.&#10;2. Share information about Whiting's dealings with the Kumaji: To ensure that everyone is informed and can make decisions based on all available facts, it is essential to share what is known about Whiting's business dealings with the Kumaji moneylender and his potential betrayal of the caravan. This information will help the colony understand why Whiting may have left and assist in determining the best course of action to locate him.&#10;3. Approach the Kumaji with caution: If it is suspected that Whiting has betrayed the caravan, it is vital to approach any interaction with the Kumaji cautiously. They may be expecting an attack or retaliation from the colonists and could react negatively if they feel threatened. It would be best to send a small, peaceful delegation to negotiate with the Kumaji and gather information about Whiting's whereabouts.&#10;4. Investigate the Kumaji encampment: If negotiations with the Kumaji prove unfruitful or unsuccessful, it may be necessary to investigate their encampment further to locate Whiting. This should be done with caution and stealth, as an open attack could result in unnecessary casualties and hinder efforts to find Whiting.&#10;5. Prepare for potential conflict: If the Kumaji are found to be harboring Whiting or hostile towards the colonists, it may be necessary to prepare for defensive measures or even a retaliatory strike. However, this should always be a last resort and every effort should be made to resolve the situation peacefully to avoid further loss of life.&#10;6. Continue searching until Whiting is found: Regardless of whether he is located through negotiations with the Kumaji or through independent search efforts, it is crucial to continue looking for Whiting until he is found. The longer he remains missing, the greater the risk to his safety and well-being.">

This helped Steve understand the reasons behind the desertion of the town and the danger his people were facing." target="1. Steve and Mary must first ensure their own safety and escape from the Kumaji patrols. Since Steve struck Mary's atorifle aside when they were captured, they no longer have a weapon to defend themselves. They need to find a way to either get their weapon back or acquire another one without getting caught.&#10;2. Once they are safe, they should continue their journey northward towards the Kumaji settlement, as they had originally planned. Now that they know Tobias Whiting is alive and has betrayed the colonists, it is crucial for them to find him before he can reveal any more information to the Kumajis.&#10;3. When they find Whiting, Steve and Mary must confront him about his treachery and try to persuade him to redeem himself by helping the colonists instead. Since Whiting betrayed the colonists in exchange for sparing his life and ensuring his daughter's safety, he might be willing to change sides if he believes that Steve and Mary can offer him a better deal or protect him from the Kumajis.&#10;4. If Whiting refuses to help them or they cannot persuade him to change sides, Steve and Mary must find a way to inform the colonists about his betrayal without putting themselves in danger. They could do this by sending a message through another trusted person or using a secret code to communicate with the colonists.&#10;5. Finally, Steve and Mary must ensure their own safety and that of the colonists as they make their way to Oasis City. Steve has already shown his determination to protect his people and use his &quot;extra strong right arm&quot; to help them in their journey. He and Mary must continue to work together and stay vigilant to face any dangers that may come their way.">

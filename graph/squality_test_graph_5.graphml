Later, they come across a building where Maota lives, which is different from the other buildings in the city and smaller in size.&#10;&#10;Maota lives in this unusual building because he is an ancient being who has been around for a long time, as evidenced by his knowledge of the machine that Michaelson finds fascinating. The building may represent a space that is more suited to Maota's unique existence and needs, separate from the rest of the city. It is possible that Maota has lived in this building for an extended period, allowing him to be close to the city while also maintaining his solitude and privacy." />

He felt Maota's presence.&#10; &#10; &quot;You devil!&quot; Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger, irrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.&#10;&quot;I said you were a god. I said you were a god. I said you were a god...! &quot;" />
    <node id="This is where you live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around. The room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is this old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing a life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above the bed a &quot;clock&quot; was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his fright—thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.&#10; &#10; Maota pointed to it.&#10; &#10; &quot;You asked about this machine,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I will tell you.&quot; He laid his hand against it. &quot;Here is power to follow another direction.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight, then sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he forced a short laugh. &quot;Maota, you are complex. Why not stop all this mystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course.&quot; Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. &quot;What do you suppose happened to this race?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You tell me.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="'s thought was directed at him in this place of no direction. &quot;Think of the city and you will see it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking through a window.

You did not win after all.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Neither did you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But this existence has compensations,&quot; Maota said. &quot;You can be anywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the old, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life force—he didn't stop to define it—in his body. Why was his dead body different from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread stretching from the reality of his body to his present state?&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't like your thoughts,&quot; Maota said. &quot;No one can go back. I tried.

Far away.&quot; Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the city?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There are many directions. You would not understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;East. West. North. South. Up. Down.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of the city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed against larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading to a particular building.&#10; &#10; Michaelson said, &quot;This is where you live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maota went inside.

He got up and looked around, then it struck him. He was standing up!&#10; &#10; &#10; The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference between himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where he went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind, leading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the&#10;&quot;clock&quot; was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.&#10; &#10; To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result as before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.&#10; &#10; &quot;You devil!&quot; Maota" />

The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian tombs—none can hold a candle to this.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mr. Earthgod....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man shrugged. &quot;It is not an item worthy of dispute.

But Maota was an old man.&#10; &#10; He dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to pick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers, hung on and was pulled to his feet.&#10; &#10; They struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking sand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth, over Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw impersonal shadows down where they fought.&#10; &#10; Then quite suddenly a finger or hand—neither knew whose finger or hand—touched the firing stud.&#10; &#10; There was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the total destruction they might have caused.&#10; &#10; &quot;It only hit the ground,&quot; Michaelson said.&#10; &#10; A black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and—" />

He looked down into the black, charred hole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking half-heartedly again for the book.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look,&quot; Michaelson said. &quot;I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human. Why not have a try at negotiating our differences?&quot;&#10; &#10; He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's face. Finally he shook his head sadly. &quot;When we first met I hoped we could think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge.

He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in sight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.&#10; &#10; &quot;See?&quot; he said. &quot;The spirits read. They must have been great readers, these people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how gentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson laughed. &quot;You certainly have an imagination.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; Maota cried, suddenly angry. &quot;You want to close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no slightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is, for spirits whose existence I cannot prove.&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man's eyes were furious now, deadly.

Throw it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items around.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It won't break. Throw it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand against his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed through it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for a suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle softly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but his desire to hear the book was strong.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Old Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the syntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been a professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley, Browning.

    <node id="In the story, the character named Native, who is also referred to as Mr. Earthgod, expresses the need to preserve the ancient city where they are currently residing. He suggests building a museum on a hill just outside the city where all the old writings and artifacts can be collected, preserved, and displayed for future generations to learn from. This would involve carefully excavating and cataloging each item to prevent further decay and damage.&#10;&#10;&#09;The character named Maota, who is a resident of the ancient city, initially disagrees with Native's proposal. He believes that the city should be left untouched and that the spirits of the people who once lived there may return one day. However, as the story progresses, Maota begins to understand the value of preserving the city's history and culture.&#10;&#10;&#09;To build a museum and collect old writings for deciphering, several steps must be taken. First, an appropriate location must be selected that is large enough to accommodate the museum and any excavation sites. Next, permits and permissions must be obtained from relevant authorities to carry out archaeological digs and move any artifacts discovered.&#10;&#10;&#09;Once permission has been granted, a team of archaeologists and historians can begin excavating the site carefully, ensuring that all artifacts are documented and preserved for further study. Any writing or inscriptions found on these artifacts must be carefully cataloged and studied by linguists and historians to decipher their meaning and gain insights into the culture and history of the people who created them.&#10;&#10;&#09;Once a sufficient collection of artifacts has been gathered, they can be displayed in the museum for visitors to see and learn from. Interpretive materials, such as labels, signs, and multimedia displays, can be used to help visitors understand the significance of each artifact and its place within the broader context of the ancient city's history and culture.&#10;&#10;&#09;In summary, to preserve the ancient city discussed in the story, a museum should be built on a nearby hill where all the old writings and artifacts can be collected, preserved, and displayed for future generations to learn from. This would involve carefully excavating and cataloging each item, studying any writing or inscriptions found on them, and creating interpretive materials to help visitors understand their significance." />

Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They must be preserved. Future generations will thank us.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you mean,&quot; the old man asked, aghast, &quot;that you want others to come here? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who lived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged and preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their foul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot; Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.&#10; &#10; Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his body. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his heel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.&#10; &#10; The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper" />

It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring in his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.&#10; &#10; A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall, fragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring God-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already destroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the artistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.&#10; &#10; I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They say these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's see, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand lifetimes.&#10; &#10; And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those years!&#10; &#10; He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery of the city.

For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history? Why not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a subject worthy of a book.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maota shook his head. &quot;One does not study a dead culture to learn how they made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must kill you now, so I can get some rest.&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man raised the gun.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait!

I will kill you anyway.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I suggest we negotiate.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; Maota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand and wind, leather skin lined and" />
    <node id="The &quot;keeper of the city&quot; is a man referred to as the webfoot or Old Maota. He is a native of the city who has been there for a long time and considers himself the caretaker of the city, believing that spirits may return to it. He insists that the protagonist, Michaelson, must leave the city because he fears that Michaelson's presence and actions may disturb or destroy the homes of ancient spirits that may still reside in the city. The webfoot believes that even a small change, such as Michaelson touching or handling objects in the city, could cause a spirit to lose its way. He is very serious about this and warns Michaelson to leave quickly or be killed." />

Who are you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am keeper of the city.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You?&quot; Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was, said, &quot;What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The spirits may return.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his trousers. He pointed. &quot;See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say, some alloy impervious to rust and wear.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The spirits are angry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons, and rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Leave!&quot;&#10; &#10; The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in anger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly serious.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id=" spirits are angry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer than I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms?

    <node id=", weathered old face was working around the mouth in anger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly serious.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look,&quot; he said. &quot;No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know that? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half covered with sand and dirt.&quot;&#10; &#10; He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The sun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He glanced backward. The webfoot was following.&#10; &#10; &quot;Mr. Earthgod!&quot; the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.&#10;&quot;You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy the home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of change and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now, or be killed.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He turned and walked off, not looking back.&#10; &#10; Michaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide, hands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond a huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of the intelligent ones" />
    <node id="1. Pressing the button on the instrument, as described by Maota, transports the user's mind to another place or dimension. This is revealed when Michaelson presses the button and finds himself standing up, no longer in his own body. The resulting implication is that this instrument allows for some form of consciousness travel or astral projection, enabling the user to separate their mind from their physical body.&#10;2. Later, Maota explains that this instrument has the power to follow another direction, which might imply that it can be used for more than just transporting the mind. It could potentially allow users to explore other dimensions, realities, or even time-travel, given the right knowledge and application of its abilities.&#10;3. The significance of pressing the button is that it provides access to a world beyond our own, challenging the user's perceptions and understanding of reality. The implications are vast, as this technology could revolutionize science, medicine, and transportation if harnessed properly. However, given the story's context, it seems that only Michaelson has successfully used the instrument for mind-transportation, leaving its full potential unknown." />
    <node id="Of course.&quot; Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. &quot;What do you suppose happened to this race?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You tell me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know how the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not die out, as a species becomes extinct.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson was amused, but interested. &quot;Something like a fourth dimension?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death. I have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people who conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science, who devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the face of the instrument? Press the button, and....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the streets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now I will do so.&quot;&#10; &#10; Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched whine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it then rose" />
    <node id=" day. He spent long hours in the huge square building with the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination. Then he searched the books for information about the instrument.&#10; &#10; Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all evidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He had to know if the machine would work for him.&#10; &#10; And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows over the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old man's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but determined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the button.&#10; &#10; The high-pitched whine started.&#10; &#10; Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes; nothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only like the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left or right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look!&quot; Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no direction. &quot;Think of the city and you will see it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson did, and" />

They had been digging in the sand, searching for the book which Maota believed was lost in the struggle.&#10;3. The book is not directly linked to a living being, but Maota, one of the characters, believes that the book has a soul and loves him for taking care of it. He is distraught when he thinks the book is lost or destroyed. Later, it is revealed that the book is capable of producing sounds or voices when touched, which contributes to Maota's belief in its &quot;living&quot; nature." />
    <node id=" his hair. Feeling better, he went back.&#10; &#10; The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought a coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind sighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the sand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.&#10; &#10; It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over the binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted at the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the writing was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the writing.&#10; &#10; Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.&#10; &#10; &quot;God in heaven!&quot; he exclaimed.&#10; &#10; He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the length of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not Maota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he stooped and picked up the book again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good God!&quot; he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had touched the writing again" />
    <node id="1. In this passage, Michaelson throws the book to Maota as a gesture of goodwill and to show that he is not threatening. This action helps to de-escalate the tense situation and allows them to continue their conversation without the immediate threat of violence.&#10;2. Based on Maota's attitude towards sharing the content of the book, it is clear that he values it highly and sees it as more than just a physical object. He refers to it as &quot;talking&quot; which suggests that it has some sort of special or unique properties. However, when Michaelson asks him what kind of book it is and what's in it, Maota responds with confusion, suggesting that he may not fully understand the significance or value of the book himself. This reinforces the idea that the book is not just a regular book, but something more special and unique. Overall, this passage highlights the importance of communication and trust in building relationships and resolving conflicts." />
    <node id="Fine, but my head aches a little.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry,&quot; Maota said.&#10; &#10; &quot;For what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;For hitting you.

I should have killed you outright.&quot;&#10; &#10; He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.&#10; &#10; It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked like a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its appearance. It was a deadly weapon.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;before you kill me, tell me about the book.&quot; He held it up for Maota to see.&#10; &#10; &quot;What about the book?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What kind of book is it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what kind of book? You have seen it. It is like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it talks.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, no. I mean, what's in it?&quot;&#10; &#10;" />

    <node id="1. The explorer, Mr. Michaelson, is an archaeologist who has discovered an ancient city on Alpha Centauri II that was built by a colony from the fifth planet of the system. He is fascinated by the city's structures, which come in various shapes and sizes such as square, ellipsoid, spheroid, conical towers, and bridges connecting them. The buildings show a high level of advancement in technology and design.&#10;&#10;2. While exploring, he finds well-preserved artifacts like an ancient bowl with metal untouched by the ages and a one-foot-high statue that is identical to Earthmen. These discoveries suggest that the civilization that built this city had advanced knowledge of metallurgy and craftsmanship.&#10;&#10;3. Michaelson also observes desert plants growing on roofs of smaller buildings, indicating that the city has been abandoned for centuries, possibly due to the migration or extinction of its inhabitants. Sand has filled the doorways, and the overall atmosphere is one of age, decay, and silence.&#10;&#10;4. Despite warnings from a local webfooted man called Old Maota, who believes that disturbing the city will anger ancient spirits residing there, Michaelson continues his exploration, driven by curiosity and the thrill of discovery. This shows his dedication to archaeology but also disregard for the cultural beliefs of the native people.&#10;&#10;5. Throughout his exploration, Michaelson experiences a sense of solitude and slight apprehension, being aware of the potential dangers on an alien planet. However, he is comforted by the fact that he carries a mysterious device (a tiny cylinder) embedded behind his ear, which can take him back to Earth instantly with just a thought." />

One look into the alert old eyes had told him that.&#10; &#10; Michaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity. He entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed floors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items, making a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched by the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest detail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books still standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without tools.&#10; &#10; Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.&#10; &#10; He stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell of age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered through clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness, dead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in the sun.&#10; &#10; There was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although this was Alpha Centaurus II" />

Then he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving his arms madly. &quot;Mr. Earthgod,&quot; he cried. &quot;It is sacred ground where you are trespassing!&quot;&#10; &#10; The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short, even for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up and down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet dragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.&#10; &#10; &quot;You never told us about this old dead city,&quot; Michaelson said, chidingly. &quot;Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it beautiful?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Leave?&quot; Michaelson asked, acting surprised" />

He was far down the ancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of time to wonder about him.&#10; &#10; He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings before him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge with tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square buildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges connected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind after half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony surfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets and filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller buildings.&#10; &#10; Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins happily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact, marveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to catch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully.

    <node id="1. The cylinder behind Michaelson's ear is a device that allows him to achieve mental time travel or astral projection, separating his mind from his physical body. When he presses the button on the cylinder, he is able to transport his consciousness to another place or dimension.&#10;2. In contrast, Maota's experience with the cylinder is different because he plans to go in a direction other than the conventional compass directions (east, west, north, south, up, or down). He explains that there is another direction, but Michaelson admits that he wouldn't understand it. This implies that Maota may have a deeper understanding or connection to the cylinder's abilities and potential uses beyond mere mental time travel.&#10;3. The cylinder's significance lies in its ability to challenge the user's perceptions of reality and enable them to explore other dimensions, realities, or even time-travel given the right knowledge and application of its abilities. However, only Michaelson has successfully used the instrument for mind-transportation, leaving its full potential unknown." />
    <node id="1. The speaker in this text is Michaelson.&#10;2. Michaelson argues to Maota that he is not a god, despite Maota's belief to the contrary, by explaining that he has discussed the possibility of going back in time with many people, and no one has been able to do it. He then tries to use a cylinder to transport himself to another place or time, but Maota resists, fearing for his safety. When Michaelson successfully uses the cylinder, he realizes that he is standing up and that this must be the difference between himself and Maota - when he uses the cylinder, he goes somewhere else, where Maota is now. He then sees his own body fall down and feels Maota's presence, leading him to believe that the cylinder is a mechanism for transporting only the mind to another place or time." />
    <node id="The &quot;clock&quot; above the bed and the instrument that Maota described as having power to follow another direction are both related to the cylinder and its ability to transport the mind to another place or time. The 'clock' seems to be a mechanism for this mental transportation, while the cylinder is what Michaelson uses to physically travel to a different location. This is evidenced by the fact that when Michaelson uses the cylinder, he sees his own body lying down and feels Maota's presence, indicating that his mind has traveled to the same place as Maota's but his physical body remains in its original location. The 'clock' and the cylinder are means for the characters to access a form of existence where they can be &quot;anywhere, see anywhere on this planet&quot; and even on Earth, as Maota describes it." />
    <node id="Michaelson determined that he wanted to fight the old webfooted man, Old Maota, after being knocked unconscious and waking up with a head wound. The weapon used to injure him was an ancient book, which suggests that Old Maota attacked Michaelson in order to protect the city from desecration. The head wound and the blood loss it caused likely contributed to Michaelson's desire to fight, as he may have been feeling angry, disoriented, or vulnerable due to the injury. Additionally, the fact that his own blood was mixing with that of the ancient city might have further fueled his determination to stay and fight for what he wanted to discover there." />

But there was a new determination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool wanted, a fight he would get.

Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked blood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.&#10; &#10; The wind had turned cool.

Here he stopped, gasping for air, feeling the pain throb in his head.&#10; &#10; Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could be accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss of blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail of important discoveries he had no common sense.&#10; &#10; He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.&#10; &#10; Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in the sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair, familiar to Michaelson.&#10; &#10; Michaelson asked, &quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sorry to hear that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How do you feel?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fine, but my head aches a little.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry,&quot; Maota said.&#10; &#10; &quot;For what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;For" />

He emphasizes this point by stating that he can be hurt, loves, hates, was born, and will die, just like any other human being. Michaelson also tells Maota that he has tried to go back in time, but no one has been able to do it, further proving his humanity." />

One either loves them, or kills them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's another thing. I am not a god.

    <node id="1. The button on the instrument, as described by Maota, allows for consciousness travel or astral projection when pressed. When Michaelson presses the button, he finds himself standing up, no longer in his own body, indicating that the button separates the user's mind from their physical body and transports it to another place or dimension.&#10;2. The possible outcome of pressing the button could be challenging the user's perceptions and understanding of reality, as they are transported to a world beyond their own. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields such as science, medicine, and transportation if harnessed correctly. However, based on the story, only Michaelson has successfully used the instrument for mind-transportation, leaving its full potential unknown. The button might also allow users to explore other dimensions, realities, or even time-travel given the right knowledge and application of its abilities." />

Maota lives in a unique building that is different from the other buildings in the city and smaller in size, possibly representing a space that is more suited to his needs as an ancient being who has been around for a long time. He may have lived in this building for an extended period, allowing him to be close to the city while also maintaining his solitude and privacy.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the significance of the clock-like machine and Maota's solitary life is that they are both related to the cylinder and its ability to transport the mind to another place or time.

The metal wall and inscriptions that he points out are significant because they provide evidence that the city was once inhabited by intelligent beings who left behind advanced technology and inscriptions that may hold important information about their culture and way of life.

This mysterious quality and Maota's emotional attachment to the book may pique Michaelson's interest in understanding its significance and value.

The significance of Michaelson throwing the book to Maota's feet is that it serves as a conciliatory gesture, demonstrating that he does not wish to threaten or harm Maota and wants to continue their conversation peacefully. This action helps to build trust and rapport between them, which is crucial for resolving conflicts and establishing a positive relationship.&#10;2. Michaelson's desire to hear the book being read reflects his interest in understanding its unique properties and value. As previously mentioned, the book has the ability to produce sounds or voices when touched, which could indicate that it contains important knowledge or wisdom from ancient spirits or cultures. Michaelson, as a scholar and researcher, may be interested in learning more about the significance and value of the book's contents, even if it means putting himself in a potentially dangerous situation. His respect for Maota and desire to build trust with him may also play a role in his decision to listen to the book being read.&#10;&#10;Regarding Michaelson's concern for the book's well-being, while he does value the book as a valuable artifact, his actions suggest that his interest in understanding its unique properties and significance outweighs his immediate concern for its physical safety. By throwing the book to Maota's feet instead of letting him fetch it, Michaelson is demonstrating his willingness to take risks and engage with the book in a way that may be unconventional or even dangerous. However, this does not necessarily mean that he lacks concern for the book's well-being; rather, it reflects his desire to learn more about its unique properties and value." />

Steady for a moment, it then rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.&#10; &#10; The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay still. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more carefully. No question about it.&#10; &#10; The old man was dead.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside the city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and gleamed in the moonlight.

When the gun went off, it hit the ground, causing a two-foot diameter, blackened hole.&#10;&#10;2. The book plays an important role in relation to the hole because it is what the two characters were fighting over when they accidentally fired the gun. They had been digging in the sand, searching for the book which Maota believed was lost in the struggle. For the old man, the book is deeply significant and distressing to lose because he believes that it has a soul and loves him for taking care of it. He sees it as a &quot;living&quot; being with spirits that drink the book like an elixir, and its potential loss or destruction is met with anger and fervor." />

He suggests building a museum on a hill just outside the city where all the old writings and artifacts can be collected, preserved, and displayed for future generations to learn from. This would involve carefully excavating and cataloging each item to prevent further decay and damage.&#10;&#10;&#09;The character named Maota, who is a resident of the ancient city, initially disagrees with Native's proposal. He believes that the city should be left untouched and that the spirits of the people who once lived there may return one day. However, as the story progresses, Maota begins to understand the value of preserving the city's history and culture.&#10;&#10;&#09;To build a museum and collect old writings for deciphering, several steps must be taken. First, an appropriate location must be selected that is large enough to accommodate the museum and any excavation sites. Next, permits and permissions must be obtained from relevant authorities to carry out archaeological digs and move any artifacts discovered.&#10;&#10;&#09;Once permission has been granted, a team of archaeologists and historians can begin excavating the site carefully, ensuring that all artifacts are documented and preserved for further study. Any writing or inscriptions found on these artifacts must be carefully cataloged and studied by linguists and historians to decipher their meaning and gain insights into the culture and history of the people who created them.&#10;&#10;&#09;Once a sufficient collection of artifacts has been gathered, they can be displayed in the museum for visitors to see and learn from. Interpretive materials, such as labels, signs, and multimedia displays, can be used to help visitors understand the significance of each artifact and its place within the broader context of the ancient city's history and culture.&#10;&#10;&#09;In summary, to preserve the ancient city discussed in the story, a museum should be built on a nearby hill where all the old writings and artifacts can be collected, preserved, and displayed for future generations to learn from.

Down.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of the city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed against larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading to a particular building.&#10; &#10; Michaelson said, &quot;This is where you live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around. The room" target="The native, known as the webfoot or Old Maota, insists that Michaelson leave Alpha Centauri II because he believes that Michaelson's presence and actions may disturb or destroy the homes of ancient spirits that may still reside in the city. He thinks that even a small change, such as Michaelson touching or handling objects in the city, could cause a spirit to lose its way. The metal wall and inscriptions that he points out are significant because they provide evidence that the city was once inhabited by intelligent beings who left behind advanced technology and inscriptions that may hold important information about their culture and way of life. However, Old Maota fears that any attempt to decipher or tamper with these artifacts could anger the spirits and bring harm upon them.">

Pressing the button on the instrument, as described by Maota, transports the user's mind to another place or dimension. This is revealed when Michaelson presses the button and finds himself standing up, no longer in his own body. The resulting implication is that this instrument allows for some form of consciousness travel or astral projection, enabling the user to separate their mind from their physical body.&#10;2. Later, Maota explains that this instrument has the power to follow another direction, which might imply that it can be used for more than just transporting the mind. It could potentially allow users to explore other dimensions, realities, or even time-travel, given the right knowledge and application of its abilities.&#10;3. The significance of pressing the button is that it provides access to a world beyond our own, challenging the user's perceptions and understanding of reality. The implications are vast, as this technology could revolutionize science, medicine, and transportation if harnessed properly. However, given the story's context, it seems that only Michaelson has successfully used the instrument for mind-transportation, leaving its full potential unknown.">

In this passage, Michaelson throws the book to Maota as a gesture of goodwill and to show that he is not threatening. This action helps to de-escalate the tense situation and allows them to continue their conversation without the immediate threat of violence.&#10;2. Based on Maota's attitude towards sharing the content of the book, it is clear that he values it highly and sees it as more than just a physical object. He refers to it as &quot;talking&quot; which suggests that it has some sort of special or unique properties. However, when Michaelson asks him what kind of book it is and what's in it, Maota responds with confusion, suggesting that he may not fully understand the significance or value of the book himself. This reinforces the idea that the book is not just a regular book, but something more special and unique. Overall, this passage highlights the importance of communication and trust in building relationships and resolving conflicts.">

The cylinder behind Michaelson's ear is a device that allows him to achieve mental time travel or astral projection, separating his mind from his physical body. When he presses the button on the cylinder, he is able to transport his consciousness to another place or dimension.&#10;2. In contrast, Maota's experience with the cylinder is different because he plans to go in a direction other than the conventional compass directions (east, west, north, south, up, or down). He explains that there is another direction, but Michaelson admits that he wouldn't understand it. This implies that Maota may have a deeper understanding or connection to the cylinder's abilities and potential uses beyond mere mental time travel.&#10;3. The cylinder's significance lies in its ability to challenge the user's perceptions of reality and enable them to explore other dimensions, realities, or even time-travel given the right knowledge and application of its abilities.

However, as the story progresses, Maota begins to understand the value of preserving the city's history and culture.&#10;&#10;&#09;To build a museum and collect old writings for deciphering, several steps must be taken. First, an appropriate location must be selected that is large enough to accommodate the museum and any excavation sites. Next, permits and permissions must be obtained from relevant authorities to carry out archaeological digs and move any artifacts discovered.&#10;&#10;&#09;Once permission has been granted, a team of archaeologists and historians can begin excavating the site carefully, ensuring that all artifacts are documented and preserved for further study. Any writing or inscriptions found on these artifacts must be carefully cataloged and studied by linguists and historians to decipher their meaning and gain insights into the culture and history of the people who created them.&#10;&#10;&#09;Once a sufficient collection of artifacts has been gathered, they can be displayed in the museum for visitors to see and learn from.

According to the old man in the story, there are several steps that need to be taken to preserve the spiritual significance of the place where they currently reside:&#10;2. Build a museum on a hill just outside the city where all the old writings and artifacts can be collected, preserved, and displayed for future generations to learn from. This would involve carefully excavating and cataloging each item, studying any writing or inscriptions found on them, and creating interpretive materials to help visitors understand their significance.&#10;3. Collect all the old writings and perhaps decipher them to gain insights into how the ancient people thought and their culture's values and beliefs. This would enable future generations to think the thoughts of those who lived in that place long ago.&#10;4. Put everything under glass to protect them from decay, and build chambers to further preserve them for future study. By doing so, the artifacts can be kept safe and preserved for a longer period.&#10;5. Create a resource for scholars and researchers to study and learn from, thus benefiting society by creating a valuable cultural institution that honors the ancient civilization and ensures that their legacy and contributions are not lost to time.">

He sees this as a way to honor the ancient civilization, ensure that their legacy and contributions are not lost to time, and create a valuable cultural institution that benefits society.">

The native, known as the webfoot or Old Maota, is threatening Michaelson to leave Alpha Centauri II because he believes that Michaelson's presence and actions may disturb or destroy the homes of ancient spirits that may still reside in the city. He thinks that even a small change, such as Michaelson touching or handling objects in the city, could cause a spirit to lose its way. The webfoot takes his role as the keeper of the city very seriously and is willing to use force to protect it from any potential harm.&#10;2. The spirits hold significance in this situation because they represent the webfoot's belief in the spiritual dimension of the city, which he believes was once inhabited by intelligent beings who left behind advanced technology and inscriptions that may hold important information about their culture and way of life. The webfoot fears that any attempt to decipher or tamper with these artifacts could anger the spirits and bring harm upon them.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the native is threatening Michaelson to leave the city because he believes that his presence and actions may disturb or destroy the homes of ancient spirits who may still reside in the city. This shows the significance of the spirits in this situation as they represent the webfoot's belief in the spiritual dimension of the city and its importance to their culture and way of life.">

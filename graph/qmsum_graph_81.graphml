    <node id="The TRAPS method refers to a speech recognition approach where the time trajectory of energy at a given frequency is taken, resulting in a vector. This vector can be assigned to a phoneme, describing the phoneme which is in the center of the vector. The classification is then based on this vector. The TRAPS method involves recognizing speech based on a shortened spectrum, such as LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and mel cepstrum, by sliding a spectrogram along the frequency axis and analyzing the energy distribution across critical bands in the signal. This method is discussed in the conversation between PhD E and Professor B, but further details about its implementation and performance are not provided in the transcript." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: The TRAPS sound familiar , I {disfmarker} but I don't {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah I mean tha This is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name , but , what it is , is that normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , uh , everything starts with a spectral slice . Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding {disfmarker} sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and you keep shifting this thing , and you have a spectrogram .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So you can say &quot; well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency &quot; , and what" />
    <node id=" , across bands . And {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Well how do you {disfmarker} how do you uh convert this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number , {pause} time t&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Yeah but what 's the number ? Is it just the {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy ,&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: it 's just the amount of energy in that band from f in that time interval .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: yeah . Yes , yes . Yes , yes .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And that 's what {disfmarker} that 's what I 'm saying then , so this is a {disfmarker} this is a starting vector . It 's just like shortened f {pause} spectrum , or something . But now we are trying to understand" />
    <node id="marker} so this is {disfmarker} so this is where it is . So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected , like noise separation . Uh so we are looking in ways is {disfmarker} in uh which {disfmarker} uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically , which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise , and so far not much uh success .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested , instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model . Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise . And I thought &quot; well , that makes sense , &quot; but so far we can't get much {disfmarker} much out of it .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: uh we may try some standard techniques like spectral subtraction and {disfmarker" />
    <node id=" a all - pole model to such a spectrum . Because a all - pole model will still try to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to put the {disfmarker} the continuation basically of the {disfmarker} of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero . That 's what we want to try . I have a visitor from Brno . He 's a {disfmarker} kind of like young faculty . pretty hard - working so he {disfmarker} so he 's {disfmarker} so he 's looking into that .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition . This uh {disfmarker} this is this recognition from temporal patterns .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm ! What is that ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Ah , you don't know about TRAPS !&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: The TRAPS sound familiar , I {disfmarker} but I don't {" />
    <node id="Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So you can say &quot; well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency &quot; , and what you get is then , that you get a p {pause} vector .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And this vector can be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} s assigned to s some phoneme . Namely you can say i it {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker} I will say that this vector will eh {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector . And you can try to classify based on that .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: And you {disfmarker} so you classi so it 's a very different vector , very different properties , we don't know much about it , but the truth is {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .

    <node id=" the signal right ?&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: and you can show that in {disfmarker} that if the {disfmarker} if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the {disfmarker} the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Unless this noise is modulated . If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less . The moment you {disfmarker} moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of {disfmarker} I start from {disfmarker} from here , so you {disfmarker} {comment} you have uh no noise then you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching" />

    <node id="The usability of certain software can be challenging to implement on another architecture because it may have been initially developed using specific assumptions about the hardware and operating system. In this transcript, Professor B mentions that the software was first created using a plain C or C++ on non-Intel architectures, and later rewritten by Lucash for an Intel system called Aurora-two. This specialization for Intel architecture may make it difficult to run the software on other platforms like SUN.&#10;&#10;Intel libraries are typically available for use on Windows and Intel architecture-based systems. However, they might not be readily accessible or optimized for other platforms. Professor B mentions that there are optimized versions of these libraries for Intel's own architecture, but they may not have been checked for compatibility with other systems like SUN.&#10;&#10;To summarize, the usability of software can be challenging to implement on another architecture due to specific assumptions made during development, and Intel libraries are typically available for use on Windows and Intel-based systems." />
    <node id="1. **Number of Vectors:** The discussion revolves around the minimum number of vectors required to represent a signal, with one being the absolute minimum. They are considering increasing the number of vectors to better analyze and recognize signals.&#10;&#10;2. **Dimension of Vectors:** The concept of critical band is introduced as a potential dimension for these vectors. A critical band refers to a range of frequencies that, when stimulated together, give rise to the perception of a single tone. This idea was initially chosen arbitrarily, but they are now questioning if it is the right decision.&#10;&#10;3. **Critical Band and Signal Recognition:** There's a belief that signals can be processed across critical bands, meaning that recognizing speech might involve analyzing energy distribution not just within a single critical band but also in neighboring ones. This is based on various experiments showing that people can split signals into critical bands, and that noise modulated at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can affect recognition.&#10;&#10;4. **Vector Correlation:** The elements of each vector are quite correlated, particularly neighboring ones, because they represent similar configurations of the vocal tract. This high correlation poses issues for certain classifiers, leading to considerations of decorrelating them.&#10;&#10;5. **Frequency Bands Width and Adjacent Critical Bands:** There's a discussion about the width of the frequency bands and the potential benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously, which could provide an advantage in signal recognition.&#10;&#10;6. **Converting Energy into Vector of Numbers:** Lastly, there's a question about how to convert the energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers. The proposed solution is to use logarithmic spectral energy, which represents the amount of energy in that band from the given time interval." />

    <node id="isfmarker} this is a starting vector . It 's just like shortened f {pause} spectrum , or something .

They {disfmarker} they represent the same {disfmarker} almost the same configuration of the vocal tract .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So there 's a very high correlation . So the classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it . So we 're thinking about de - correlating them .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Then the question is uh &quot; can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions &quot; , or to what extent ?

    <node id="Content: How wide are the uh frequency bands ?&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: That 's another thing .

This is based on various experiments showing that people can split signals into critical bands and that noise modulated at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can affect recognition.&#10;&#10;4. **Vector Correlation:** The high correlation between elements of each vector, particularly neighboring ones, poses issues for certain classifiers. This has led to considerations of decorrelating them.&#10;&#10;5. **Width of Frequency Bands and Adjacent Critical Bands:** There's a discussion about the width of the frequency bands and the potential benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously. This could provide an advantage in signal recognition due to masking experiments which suggest that something is happening across critical bands.&#10;&#10;6. **Converting Energy into Vectors:** The text suggests converting energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers by using logarithmic spectral energy, representing the amount of energy in that band from the given time interval." />

Higher parameters are considered more important than lower ones for recognition because they contribute mainly to the slope in a frequency response, which is crucial for recognizing specific features in speech signals. This was observed by Professor B and mentioned during the conversation with PhD E.&#10;&#10;2. At Bell Labs, various lifters were used in attempts to improve speech recognition, including:&#10;   - Raised cosine lifter (still used in HTK, for reasons unclear)&#10;   - Exponential lifter&#10;   - Triangle lifter&#10;   These lifters were applied to fiddle with insertions, deletions, or give relative importance to various parameters during speech recognition." />

    <node id="1. **Fletcher Experiment:** The Fletcher experiment is significant in the field of psychoacoustics as it demonstrated that when people are exposed to a narrowband noise (a type of sound with energy concentrated in a specific frequency range) along with a signal, their ability to detect the signal is impaired. This phenomenon is called masking. The experiment helped establish the concept of critical bands, which are ranges of frequencies that, when stimulated together, give rise to the perception of a single tone.&#10;&#10;2. **Modulating Noise and Masking:** Modulating the noise at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can reduce masking. This happens because modulation makes the noise more distinguishable from the signal, allowing the brain to separate them more effectively. In other words, the brain can take into consideration what's happening in neighboring frequency bands when there is a relative relation between the modulated noise and the signal.&#10;&#10;3. **Cognitive Consideration of Neighboring Frequency Bands:** The Fletcher experiment and subsequent research suggest that cognitive processes are involved in signal recognition, as the brain considers energy distribution not just within a single critical band but also in neighboring ones. This has led researchers to explore the benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously, which could provide an advantage in signal recognition due to masking experiments suggesting that something is happening across critical bands." />
    <node id=" have uh no noise then you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing . And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So that 's the famous experiment of Fletcher , a long time ago .

    <node id="1. Low variance in a component indicates that the data points are close to the mean, which makes it more reliable since there's less variation within the component. To distinguish between natural low variance and low variance caused by noise, you can analyze the data and its sources:&#10;   - If the low variance is due to the nature of the data (e.g., consistent patterns), then it's likely naturally occurring.&#10;   - If the low variance is caused by noise, there would be inconsistencies in the data, which might require additional processing or filtering.&#10;2. Factors that determine whether a component has low variance and is more reliable include:&#10;   - The quality of the raw data&#10;   - How well the feature extraction process captures relevant information&#10;   - Model assumptions and the suitability for the given data&#10;&#10;To increase the importance of a specific component with low variance, consider these suggestions:&#10;&#10;1. Increase the variance by multiplying it with a number larger than one (Professor B, PhD E). This can result in a larger contribution from that component to the overall score.&#10;2. Adjust the mean of the component while increasing the variance (PhD E, PhD C) for better results.&#10;3. Modify and rerun recognition after making variance modifications multiple times to explore different possibilities (PhD E, PhD C, Professor B).&#10;4. Alternatively, adjust the model by changing certain components' variances instead of altering features directly (PhD C, PhD E). Increasing the variance can decrease the importance of a component due to its smaller contribution in the overall score (PhD D, Professor B)." />
    <node id="1. Competition and shared technology: The speakers, including PhD E and Professor B, realized they were not just friends but competitors when they discovered that multiple leading proposals, including one from French Telecom Alcatel and another unspecified proposal, both featured voice activity detector (VAD) technology. Previously, this information had not been volunteered by either party, possibly because neither wanted to reveal their competitive edge.&#10;&#10;2. Plenty of issues: There are &quot;plenty of issues&quot; related to VAD technology, as mentioned by Professor B and PhD E. Although the specific issues are not detailed in the transcript, it is clear that there is room for improvement in this area.&#10;&#10;3. Standard techniques: Professor B suggests trying &quot;standard techniques&quot; like spectral subtraction to deal with noisy speech, which could potentially improve VAD performance.&#10;&#10;4. Ad-hoc technique suggested by Dennis Klatt: Professor B mentions a method proposed by Dennis Klatt, which involves adding a moderate amount of noise to all data. This approach aims to make any additive noise less effective because the noise is already present in the data. However, it is unclear if this method was specifically applied to VAD technology or not.&#10;&#10;5. TRAPS method: The TRAPS method for speech recognition, discussed between PhD E and Professor B, could potentially be used to improve VAD performance. By recognizing speech based on a shortened spectrum, such as LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and mel cepstrum, the energy distribution across critical bands in the signal can be analyzed, which might help in better detecting voice activity.&#10;&#10;In summary, issues regarding the use of VAD technology include competition between parties, reluctance to share competitive information, and various unspecified problems that require improvement. Potential solutions include using standard techniques like spectral subtraction, applying the TRAPS method for speech recognition, or exploring ad-hoc techniques suggested by Dennis Klatt." />

    <node id="1. The new voice activity detector performed 22% better than the old baseline. This was stated by Professor B in the meeting transcript.&#10;&#10;2. If the new voice activity detector performed worse than the old baseline, the objection would be why this happened, since they don't claim their voice activity detector is wonderful and it's just one of many techniques used for comparison. They would question why their ad-hoc method (adding a moderate amount of noise to all data) or standard techniques like spectral subtraction didn't help improve the performance as expected." />

    <node id="1. To make the standard deviation wider, you can multiply the variance of the component by a number larger than one. This will increase the variance, resulting in a larger contribution from that component in the overall score. This is suggested by PhD E and Professor B.&#10;2. To make the standard deviation narrower, you can modify the mean of the component while multiplying the variance. However, this is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement for decreasing the importance of the component. Reducing the variance will result in a smaller contribution from that component in the overall score.&#10;3. When making the standard deviation narrower, it may worsen scores for certain components unless they are exactly on the mean. This is because less variance is allowed.&#10;4. To decrease the importance of a specific component, you can increase its variance. As stated by PhD D and Professor B, multiplying the variance could be an alternative approach to achieve this goal.&#10;&#10;In summary, to modify the standard deviation of a model to make it wider or narrower, you can multiply the variance of the component by a number larger or smaller than one, while also potentially adjusting the mean of the component. This will allow you to explore different possibilities and achieve certain research goals." />

    <node id="1. The simple technique described by Professor B involves processing a speech signal's spectrum using the output from a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This can be done in two ways:&#10;&#10;   a. Adding a constant to the power spectrum: After obtaining the power spectrum through FFT, a fixed constant value is added to it. The motivation behind this method is that adding noise uniformly across all frequencies can potentially make any additional noise less effective because some noise is already present in the data. This technique was proposed by Dennis Klatt.&#10;&#10;   b. Leaving out low-energy parts of the spectrum: This approach involves analyzing the power spectrum and identifying sections with lower energy levels. These low-energy regions are then removed or ignored during further processing. The idea is to create a simplified version of the spectrum, which can be used for speech recognition purposes.&#10;&#10;2. Professor B also suggests attempting to fit an all-pole model to the modified spectrum (after removing low-energy parts). An all-pole model attempts to continue the shape and characteristics of the original signal into regions where energy has been removed or reduced, making it suitable for analyzing truncated spectra with missing data. This can help improve the robustness of speech recognition algorithms in noisy environments." />
    <node id=" Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down , but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much , it 's a very simple technique .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique , you just take your spectrum and {disfmarker} and use whatever is coming from FFT , {pause} add constant ,&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: you know ? on {disfmarker} onto power spectrum .

They are considering increasing the number of vectors to better analyze and recognize signals.&#10;&#10;2. **Dimension of Vectors:** The concept of critical band is introduced as a potential dimension for these vectors. A critical band refers to a range of frequencies that, when stimulated together, give rise to the perception of a single tone. This idea was initially chosen arbitrarily, but they are now questioning if it is the right decision.&#10;&#10;3. **Critical Band and Signal Recognition:** There's a belief that signals can be processed across critical bands, meaning that recognizing speech might involve analyzing energy distribution not just within a single critical band but also in neighboring ones. This is based on various experiments showing that people can split signals into critical bands, and that noise modulated at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can affect recognition.&#10;&#10;4. **Vector Correlation:** The elements of each vector are quite correlated, particularly neighboring ones, because they represent similar configurations of the vocal tract. This high correlation poses issues for certain classifiers, leading to considerations of decorrelating them.&#10;&#10;5. **Frequency Bands Width and Adjacent Critical Bands:** There's a discussion about the width of the frequency bands and the potential benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously, which could provide an advantage in signal recognition.&#10;&#10;6. **Converting Energy into Vector of Numbers:** Lastly, there's a question about how to convert the energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers.

This is based on various experiments showing that people can split signals into critical bands and that noise modulated at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can affect recognition.&#10;&#10;4. **Vector Correlation:** The high correlation between elements of each vector, particularly neighboring ones, poses issues for certain classifiers. This has led to considerations of decorrelating them.&#10;&#10;5. **Width of Frequency Bands and Adjacent Critical Bands:** There's a discussion about the width of the frequency bands and the potential benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously. This could provide an advantage in signal recognition due to masking experiments which suggest that something is happening across critical bands.&#10;&#10;6. **Converting Energy into Vectors:** The text suggests converting energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers by using logarithmic spectral energy, representing the amount of energy in that band from the given time interval.">

The experiment helped establish the concept of critical bands, which are ranges of frequencies that, when stimulated together, give rise to the perception of a single tone.&#10;&#10;2. **Modulating Noise and Masking:** Modulating the noise at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can reduce masking. This happens because modulation makes the noise more distinguishable from the signal, allowing the brain to separate them more effectively. In other words, the brain can take into consideration what's happening in neighboring frequency bands when there is a relative relation between the modulated noise and the signal.&#10;&#10;3. **Cognitive Consideration of Neighboring Frequency Bands:** The Fletcher experiment and subsequent research suggest that cognitive processes are involved in signal recognition, as the brain considers energy distribution not just within a single critical band but also in neighboring ones. This has led researchers to explore the benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously, which could provide an advantage in signal recognition due to masking experiments suggesting that something is happening across critical bands.">

Low variance in a component indicates that the data points are close to the mean, which makes it more reliable since there's less variation within the component. To distinguish between natural low variance and low variance caused by noise, you can analyze the data and its sources:&#10;   - If the low variance is due to the nature of the data (e.g., consistent patterns), then it's likely naturally occurring.&#10;   - If the low variance is caused by noise, there would be inconsistencies in the data, which might require additional processing or filtering.&#10;2.

This approach aims to make any additive noise less effective because the noise is already present in the data." target="1. The simple technique described by Professor B involves processing a speech signal's spectrum using the output from a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This can be done in two ways:&#10;&#10;   a. Adding a constant to the power spectrum: After obtaining the power spectrum through FFT, a fixed constant value is added to it. The motivation behind this method is that adding noise uniformly across all frequencies can potentially make any additional noise less effective because some noise is already present in the data. This technique was proposed by Dennis Klatt.&#10;&#10;   b. Leaving out low-energy parts of the spectrum: This approach involves analyzing the power spectrum and identifying sections with lower energy levels. These low-energy regions are then removed or ignored during further processing. The idea is to create a simplified version of the spectrum, which can be used for speech recognition purposes.&#10;&#10;2. Professor B also suggests attempting to fit an all-pole model to the modified spectrum (after removing low-energy parts). An all-pole model attempts to continue the shape and characteristics of the original signal into regions where energy has been removed or reduced, making it suitable for analyzing truncated spectra with missing data. This can help improve the robustness of speech recognition algorithms in noisy environments.">

This phenomenon is called masking. The experiment helped establish the concept of critical bands, which are ranges of frequencies that, when stimulated together, give rise to the perception of a single tone.&#10;&#10;2. **Modulating Noise and Masking:** Modulating the noise at the same frequency as the signal within a critical band can reduce masking. This happens because modulation makes the noise more distinguishable from the signal, allowing the brain to separate them more effectively. In other words, the brain can take into consideration what's happening in neighboring frequency bands when there is a relative relation between the modulated noise and the signal.&#10;&#10;3. **Cognitive Consideration of Neighboring Frequency Bands:** The Fletcher experiment and subsequent research suggest that cognitive processes are involved in signal recognition, as the brain considers energy distribution not just within a single critical band but also in neighboring ones. This has led researchers to explore the benefits of using two adjacent critical bands simultaneously, which could provide an advantage in signal recognition due to masking experiments suggesting that something is happening across critical bands." target=" have uh no noise then you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing .

Potential solutions include using standard techniques like spectral subtraction, applying the TRAPS method for speech recognition, or exploring ad-hoc techniques suggested by Dennis Klatt." target="aker: PhD C&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: We get this sort of improvement , how come that we don't see it on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on your endpointed data ?&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Yeah .

This will increase the variance, resulting in a larger contribution from that component in the overall score. This is suggested by PhD E and Professor B.&#10;2.

    <edge source="1. The simple technique described by Professor B involves processing a speech signal's spectrum using the output from a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This can be done in two ways:&#10;&#10;   a. Adding a constant to the power spectrum: After obtaining the power spectrum through FFT, a fixed constant value is added to it. The motivation behind this method is that adding noise uniformly across all frequencies can potentially make any additional noise less effective because some noise is already present in the data. This technique was proposed by Dennis Klatt.&#10;&#10;   b. Leaving out low-energy parts of the spectrum: This approach involves analyzing the power spectrum and identifying sections with lower energy levels. These low-energy regions are then removed or ignored during further processing. The idea is to create a simplified version of the spectrum, which can be used for speech recognition purposes.&#10;&#10;2. Professor B also suggests attempting to fit an all-pole model to the modified spectrum (after removing low-energy parts). An all-pole model attempts to continue the shape and characteristics of the original signal into regions where energy has been removed or reduced, making it suitable for analyzing truncated spectra with missing data. This can help improve the robustness of speech recognition algorithms in noisy environments." target=" Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down , but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much , it 's a very simple technique .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique , you just take your spectrum and {disfmarker} and use whatever is coming from FFT , {pause} add constant ,&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: you know ? on {disfmarker} onto power spectrum .

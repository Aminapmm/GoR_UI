    <node id="based on the narrative, Carol (Molly) has undergone a change in her perspective towards the boys in her town, specifically after overhearing Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock's conversation. Initially, she viewed the boys impersonally, pitying them but not considering that they might have any interest in her. However, after overhearing their conversation, she becomes aware that they are observing her and judging her, making her feel self-conscious. She is particularly disturbed by the fact that even young boys like Cy Bogart are discussing her husband's personal habits.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol realizes that she may not fit in with the townspeople as much as she thought she did. She wonders if the townsfolk see her as stuck-up and whether they are watching and judging her actions. This realization makes her feel isolated and uncertain about her place in the community.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that Carol's perspective on the boys in her town has shifted from one of detached pity to a recognition of their judgmental attitude towards her. This shift in perspective has made her feel self-conscious and unsure of her place in the community." />

No schoolgirl passed&#10;their observation-posts more flushingly than did Mrs. Dr. Kennicott. In&#10;shame she knew that they glanced appraisingly at her snowy overshoes,&#10;speculating about her legs. Theirs were not young eyes--there was no&#10;youth in all the town, she agonized. They were born old, grim and old&#10;and spying and censorious.&#10;&#10;She cried again that their youth was senile and cruel on the day when&#10;she overheard Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock.&#10;&#10;Cyrus N. Bogart, son of the righteous widow who lived across the alley,&#10;was at this time a boy of fourteen or fifteen. Carol had already seen&#10;quite enough of Cy Bogart.

He was, in fact, a museum&#10;specimen of what a small town, a well-disciplined public school, a&#10;tradition of hearty humor, and a pious mother could produce from the&#10;material of a courageous and ingenious mind.&#10;&#10;Carol was afraid of him. Far from protesting when he set his mongrel on&#10;a kitten, she worked hard at not seeing him.&#10;&#10;The Kennicott garage was a shed littered with paint-cans, tools, a&#10;lawn-mower, and ancient wisps of hay. Above it was a loft which Cy&#10;Bogart and Earl Haydock, young brother of Harry, used as a den, for&#10;smoking, hiding from whippings, and planning secret societies. They&#10;climbed to it by a ladder on the alley side of the shed.&#10;&#10;This morning of late January, two or three weeks after Vida's&#10;revelations, Carol had gone into the stable-garage to find a hammer.&#10;Snow softened her step.

    <node id="The text describes how the advent of automobiles and leisure activities have contributed to the social divisions in Gopher Prairie, making it more apparent who belongs to which social class. The ease and luxury of driving around in cars have led people to view skiing, sliding, and other physical activities as &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;old-fashioned.&quot; As a result, there is a longing for city recreations, with the town taking pride in neglecting traditional activities like coasting, just as cities take pride in their lack of interest in rural sports.&#10;&#10;Moreover, these changes have also impacted the values and perceptions of people in the town. Carol, who has recently moved there, finds herself being judged for her speech and clothing choices, with the locals viewing her as affected and showing off. The text highlights that the Gopher Prairie standards are reasonable to Gopher Prairians, just as Lake Shore Drive standards are to Chicagoans or Londoners. However, it is worth noting that there are more Gopher Prairies than Chicagos or Londons, which may indicate a wider acceptance of these values and social dynamics in smaller towns across the country.&#10;&#10;In summary, the impact of automobiles and leisure activities on Gopher Prairie has been to heighten social divisions, shift values towards luxury and ease, and create a culture where traditional recreational activities are viewed as inferior to those enjoyed in cities. The text also highlights how newcomers like Carol must navigate these dynamics and adapt their behavior to fit in, or risk being seen as outsiders." />

Her&#10;finger-tips loved the silken fur.&#10;&#10;Her liveliest activity now was organizing outdoor sports in the&#10;motor-paralyzed town.&#10;&#10;The automobile and bridge-whist had not only made more evident the&#10;social divisions in Gopher Prairie but they had also enfeebled the&#10;love of activity. It was so rich-looking to sit and drive--and so easy.&#10;Skiing and sliding were &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;old-fashioned.&quot; In fact, the&#10;village longed for the elegance of city recreations almost as much as&#10;the cities longed for village sports; and Gopher Prairie took as&#10;much pride in neglecting coasting as St. Paul--or New York--in" />

Sam Clark was no more loyal than girl librarians she&#10;knew in St. Paul, the people she had met in Chicago. And those others&#10;had so much that Gopher Prairie complacently lacked--the world of gaiety&#10;and adventure, of music and the integrity of bronze, of remembered&#10;mists from tropic isles and Paris nights and the walls of Bagdad, of&#10;industrial justice and a God who spake not in doggerel hymns.&#10;&#10;One seed. Which seed it was did not matter. All knowledge and freedom&#10;were one. But she had delayed so long in finding that seed. Could she&#10;do something with this Thanatopsis Club?

Workmen were&#10;wheeling barrels of flour into a box-car; a farmer sitting on sacks of&#10;wheat in a bobsled argued with the wheat-buyer; machinery within the&#10;mill boomed and whined, water gurgled in the ice-freed mill-race.&#10;&#10;The clatter was a relief to Carol after months of smug houses. She&#10;wished that she could work in the mill; that she did not belong to the&#10;caste of professional-man's-wife.&#10;&#10;She started for home, through the small slum. Before a tar-paper shack,&#10;at a gateless gate, a man in rough brown dogskin coat and black plush&#10;cap with lappets was watching her.

    <node id="The woman, named Carol Kennicott, had an experience at the Bon Ton Store where she encountered Guy Pollock and Raymie Wutherspoon. Pollock was tentatively buying a gray scarf, and Carol invited him to come play cribbage some evening. He seemed genuinely interested and begged to come.&#10;&#10;Raymie Wutherspoon, a salesperson at the store, tiptoed up to Carol and asked her to come back to his department to see a pair of patent leather slippers he had set aside for her. Raymie unlaced her boots, tucked her skirt about her ankles, and slid on the slippers for her. She took them, and Raymie told her that she was a good salesman. However, Raymie insisted that he wasn't a salesman at all but simply liked elegant things.&#10;&#10;Carol noticed that some people in town seemed to be treating her differently, and she felt self-conscious about it. She couldn't help but feel like they were watching her and judging her. When she went to Ludelmeyer's the next day, she had a shock of shame when she saw the grocer, his clerk, and Mrs. Dave Dyer giggling. They quickly stopped and looked embarrassed when she entered, making Carol feel guilty for no reason.&#10;&#10;Overall, the experience at the Bon Ton Store was a positive one for Carol, as she was able to connect with Guy Pollock and enjoy his company. However, her interactions with Raymie Wutherspoon were more complicated, as he seemed to have ulterior motives for helping her try on shoes. Furthermore, the negative reactions from some townspeople made Carol feel self-conscious and paranoid, causing her to question whether they were intentionally being rude or if she was simply overthinking things." />

That evening when Kennicott took her to call&#10;on the crochety Lyman Casses, their hosts seemed flustered at their&#10;arrival. Kennicott jovially hooted, &quot;What makes you so hang-dog, Lym?&quot;&#10;The Casses tittered feebly.&#10;&#10;Except Dave Dyer, Sam Clark, and Raymie Wutherspoon, there were no&#10;merchants of whose welcome Carol was certain. She knew that she read&#10;mockery into greetings but she could not control her suspicion, could&#10;not rise from her psychic collapse. She alternately raged and flinched&#10;at the superiority of the merchants. They did not know that they&#10;were being rude, but they meant to have it understood that they were&#10;prosperous and &quot;not scared of no doctor's wife.&quot; They often said, &quot;One&#10;man's as good as another--and a darn sight better" />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is clear that Carol's experience at the social gathering was a challenging one for her. She had expected to be welcomed and embraced by the townspeople, but instead, she felt like an outsider. The women at the gathering seemed to be judging and gossiping about her, which made her feel self-conscious and paranoid.&#10;&#10;Carol struggled to keep from becoming oversensitive and to avoid appearing unpopular. However, she found it difficult to hide her true feelings when faced with condescending comments and questions about her appearance, her husband's personal habits, and her efforts to fit in with the community. For instance, she responded sharply when Ella Stowbody asked if she planned to send to Minneapolis for her dress for the next soiree.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol felt relieved by the admiration of Rita Simons, who looked at the steel buckles on her pumps with admiration. However, she resented Mrs. Howland's tart demand about her new couch and responded defensively, which only served to create more tension between them.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, Carol made an effort to connect with the townspeople by showing interest in their lives and families. She asked after Mrs. McGanum's baby's throat and was attentive while she described symptoms. This approach seemed to be effective, as the contaminated families were gracious towards her.&#10;&#10;When Vida Sherwin and Miss Ethel Villets arrived, Carol felt more confident and began to talk about her experiences driving in the countryside with Will. However, her efforts to connect with the townspeople were short-lived when she discovered that they had been ridiculing her attempts to give them a gay party and her Chinese costume.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is evident that Carol's experience at the social gathering was a difficult one for her.

    <node id="The protagonist, Carol, questioning whether marrying Kennicott was a mistake, indicates her growing dissatisfaction with her life in Gopher Prairie. This doubt may stem from her feeling of not fitting in with the townsfolk and their conventional ways, as well as the judgmental attitude she has become aware of among the boys in town. The trip to Lac-qui-Meurt in the Big Woods helps alleviate this internal struggle by providing Carol with a fresh perspective and boosting her confidence in herself.&#10;&#10;Carol's visit to the Chippewa Indian reservation, Lac-qui-Meurt, allows her to contrast the simplicity and warmth of the Native American community with the superficiality she experiences in Gopher Prairie. By observing the dignified and kind nature of Mrs. Kennicott, Carol gains a deeper understanding of her husband and his family's values, which strengthens her bond with them.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the journey to Lac-qui-Meurt helps Carol realize that she has been too hard on herself, thinking of herself as superior to others when, in reality, everyone shares common imperfections and desires. This realization contributes to her decision not to escape from Gopher Prairie but rather to find meaning and happiness within it by connecting with people more deeply and appreciating the value of community life.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Carol's internal struggle with whether marrying Kennicott was a mistake is closely tied to her dissatisfaction with her life in Gopher Prairie and the lack of connection she feels with its inhabitants. The trip to Lac-qui-Meurt allows her to reevaluate her situation, regain her confidence, and strengthen her relationships, ultimately helping her find happiness within her marriage and community." />

    <node id="based on the narrative, Carol, the protagonist, has become increasingly close with Bea Sorenson, one of the maids in her household. Bea considers Carol superior to the other women in the town because she admires her and sees her as a beautiful and accomplished lady, similar to college friends she loved and looked up to. Their relationship is not based on a master-servant dynamic but rather like that of Freshman for Junior, with Bea expressing genuine admiration and affection towards Carol. This closeness between Carol and Bea highlights the former's growth in understanding and valuing the townspeople, including those in lower social classes." />

But she discovered that Bea was&#10;extraordinarily like girls she had loved in college, and as a companion&#10;altogether superior to the young matrons of the Jolly Seventeen.

Though they began with&#10;propriety, Carol sitting by the kitchen table and Bea at the sink or&#10;blacking the stove, the conference was likely to end with both of them&#10;by the table, while Bea gurgled over the ice-man's attempt to kiss her,&#10;or Carol admitted, &quot;Everybody knows that the doctor is lots more clever&#10;than Dr. McGanum.&quot; When Carol came in from marketing, Bea plunged into&#10;the hall to take off her coat, rub her frostied hands, and ask, &quot;Vos&#10;dere lots of folks up-town today?&quot;&#10;&#10;This was the welcome upon which Carol depended.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VI&#10;&#10;Through her weeks of cowering there was no change in her surface life.&#10;No one save Vida was aware of her agonizing.

    <node id="The &quot;girl from the Cities&quot; is Carol Kennicott, the main character and wife of Doctor Kennicott in the story. At first, she is referred to as &quot;the girl from the Cities&quot; because she is an outsider who moved to Gopher Prairie from a city, and this shows her unfamiliarity with the rural lifestyle and attitudes of the townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Carol's reaction to learning that Doc Kennicott used to chew tobacco before marrying her is surprise, as it was news to her. This detail about Kennicott's past highlights his small-town roots and contrasts with Carol's more sophisticated upbringing in the city. The fact that Kennicott no longer chews tobacco after marrying Carol also indicates a change in his behavior due to his new domestic life and perhaps a desire to please his wife." />
    <node id="Through her weeks of cowering there was no change in her surface life.&#10;No one save Vida was aware of her agonizing.

    <node id="The townspeople perceive Carol as an affected reformer because she does not conform to their traditional ways and standards. They see her use of the word &quot;American&quot; instead of the local dialect's &quot;Ammurrican&quot; as a form of showing off, as it highlights her differences and sets her apart from them. Additionally, her actions, such as paying her maids more than the average wage and advocating for change in the town, further reinforce their perception of her as an outsider trying to impose her values on them.&#10;&#10;The townspeople's negative perception of Carol is also influenced by their own prejudices and fears. They view her efforts to reform the town as a threat to their way of life and see her as someone who looks down on them, rather than as someone who wants to help improve their community. This negative perspective creates a barrier between Carol and the townspeople, making it difficult for her to connect with them and create meaningful relationships.&#10;&#10;In summary, the townspeople perceive Carol as an affected reformer because of her use of language, her actions that challenge traditional norms, and their own prejudices and fears. These factors contribute to a negative perspective that creates distance between Carol and the townspeople, making it challenging for her to be accepted and understood in the community." />

    <node id="Carole might have wondered if people criticize her based on her interactions with the townsfolk, such as when she overheard their giggles at Ludelmeyer's grocery store and felt guilty, or when their hosts seemed flustered during a social call. These experiences may have led her to suspect that they were talking about her behind her back and criticizing her.&#10;&#10;When Carol inquired about people criticizing her, Kennicott responded by acknowledging that there were some townsfolk who were not welcoming towards her, but he reassured her that it was not personal. He suggested that they meant to have it understood that they were prosperous and not scared of the doctor's wife, implying that their behavior stemmed from insecurity rather than malice. He also mentioned that Carol was reading mockery into greetings, indicating that some of her feelings may be self-imposed." />

    <node id="The narrative does not provide a specific list of activities or resources that were limited in the town where Carol lived. However, it can be inferred that the cultural and intellectual opportunities available in the town were lacking, as Carol felt bored and unfulfilled after exploring its initial attractions. She had already read most of the books in the local library, attended all the social events, and become a member of various clubs. Despite these efforts, she still found herself feeling unsatisfied and longing for more stimulating experiences. This suggests that the town may have had limited resources in terms of education, arts, and other forms of cultural enrichment, leaving Carol feeling restricted and confined in her new environment." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Carol experiences negative consequences after giving in to her desire to run and halloo in public. When she gallops down a block and jumps over a curb, she is met with the disapproving gazes of three old women and notices that the curtain had moved at another window across the street, indicating that her behavior was being watched and judged by the townspeople. This makes Carol feel self-conscious and aware of the strict social norms of the town, causing her to suppress her youthful and defiant impulses in order to conform to the expectations of a &quot;Nice Married Woman.&quot; As a result, she attends the next weekly bridge of the Jolly Seventeen sedately and feeling confined by her new identity.

    <node id="In the narrative, Sam Clark believes that the only people with real imaginative brains in Gopher Prairie are a select few, including himself and the socialist foreman at the flour-mill, because he perceives that the town is primarily composed of individuals who possess ledger-keeping brains, duck-hunting brains, or baby-spanking brains. In other words, Sam Clark regards most people in the town as having practical or mundane intellects, rather than creative or innovative minds. This viewpoint may stem from his own business-oriented background and perspective, which values pragmatic thinking and problem-solving skills over artistic or intellectual pursuits. Additionally, the socialist foreman's political beliefs and working-class status might also contribute to Sam Clark's perception of him as having real imaginative brains, given that unconventional ideas and perspectives often stem from critical thinking and a willingness to challenge the status quo." />

She felt embarrassed and guilty, and she sensed mockery in greetings from some people in the town. This experience may have reinforced Carol's belief that the conservative culture of the town restricts her individuality and social freedom, causing her to feel frustrated and angry." />
    <node id=" Mrs. Dave Dyer.&#10;&#10;Her only anxious period was during the conference on husbands.&#10;&#10;The young matrons discussed the intimacies of domesticity with a&#10;frankness and a minuteness which dismayed Carol. Juanita Haydock&#10;communicated Harry's method of shaving, and his interest in&#10;deer-shooting. Mrs. Gougerling reported fully, and with some irritation,&#10;her husband's inappreciation of liver and bacon. Maud Dyer chronicled&#10;Dave's digestive disorders; quoted a recent bedtime controversy with&#10;him in regard to Christian Science, socks and the sewing of buttons&#10;upon vests; announced that she &quot;simply wasn't going to stand his always&#10;pawing girls when he went and got crazy-jealous if a man just danced&#10;with her&quot;; and rather more than sketched Dave's varieties of kisses.&#10;&#10;So meekly did Carol give attention, so obviously was she at last&#10;desirous of being one of them, that they looked on her fondly, and&#10;encouraged her to give such details of her honeymoon as might be of&#10;interest. She was embarrassed rather than resentful. She deliberately&#10;misunderstood. She" />
    <node id="After her trip to Lac-qui-Meurt, Carol experienced a change in perspective and increased confidence in herself. She gained a deeper understanding of her husband and his family's values through observing the dignified and kind nature of Mrs. Kennicott. This realization strengthened her bond with them and helped her see Kennicott in a new light, recognizing his genuine care for others as inherited from his mother.&#10;&#10;Carol also realized that she had been too hard on herself, thinking of herself as superior to others when, in reality, everyone shares common imperfections and desires. This revelation contributed to her decision not to escape from Gopher Prairie but rather to find meaning and happiness within it by connecting with people more deeply and appreciating the value of community life.&#10;&#10;Upon their return to Gopher Prairie on a bright, windy winter day, Kennicott was cheerful and greeted friends as they walked through town. Carol, now more accepting of her life in Gopher Prairie, took part in organizing outdoor sports in the motor-paralyzed town, further connecting with the community and finding happiness within it.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's trip to Lac-qui-Meurt allowed her to reevaluate her situation, regain her confidence, and strengthen her relationships, ultimately helping her find happiness within her marriage and community. Upon their return, both Carol and Kennicott were in good spirits, greeting friends and participating in town activities together." />
    <node id="Sam Clark believes that the only people with real imaginative brains in Gopher Prairie are a few individuals, including the socialist foreman at the flour-mill, because of his own business-oriented background and perspective which values pragmatic thinking and problem-solving skills over artistic or intellectual pursuits. He perceives most townspeople as having practical or mundane intellects, such as ledger-keeping brains, duck-hunting brains, or baby-spanking brains. The socialist foreman's political beliefs, working-class status, and unconventional ideas probably contribute to Sam Clark's perception of him as having real imaginative brains.&#10;&#10;Sam Clark has heated debates with the socialist foreman at the flour-mill because they have different ideologies and perspectives. The foreman is a regular old-line party member with dogmatic views on reforming various issues, while Sam Clark values pragmatism and practicality in thinking and problem-solving. Their contrasting viewpoints likely contribute to their contentious exchanges of ideas." />

He seemed genuinely interested and begged to come. Later, Raymie Wutherspoon, a salesperson at the store, helped Carol try on a pair of patent leather slippers and insisted that he wasn't a salesman but simply liked elegant things. Carol noticed that some people in town seemed to be treating her differently, making her feel self-conscious and paranoid. However, her interaction with Guy Pollock was a positive one, as she was able to connect with him and enjoy his company. Overall, the experience at the Bon Ton Store was both positive and negative for Carol, as she formed a connection with Pollock but also experienced complex interactions with Raymie and negative reactions from some townspeople." />

Although they come from different backgrounds and have different socio-economic statuses, Miles shows respect and courtliness toward Carol, who seems to be intrigued by his independence and proletarian philosophy.

Frosted shingles smoked against a sky colored like&#10;flax-blossoms, sleigh-bells clinked, shouts of greeting were loud in the&#10;thin bright air, and everywhere was a rhythmic sound of wood-sawing. It&#10;was Saturday, and the neighbors' sons were getting up the winter fuel.&#10;Behind walls of corded wood in back yards their sawbucks stood in&#10;depressions scattered with canary-yellow flakes of sawdust. The frames&#10;of their buck-saws were cherry-red, the blades blued steel, and the&#10;fresh cut ends of the sticks--poplar, maple, iron-wood, birch--were&#10;marked with engraved rings of growth. The boys wore shoe-packs, blue&#10;flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons, and mackinaws of crimson,&#10;lemon yellow, and foxy brown.&#10;&#10;Carol cried &quot;Fine day!&quot; to the boys; she came in a glow to Howland &amp;&#10;Gould's grocery, her collar white with frost from her breath; she bought&#10;a can of tomatoes as though it were Orient fruit;" />

His seating options include a barrel chair and a plank chair, and he also owns a dogskin coat that he tosses into the bunk when he's not wearing it. The only decoration in his room is a magazine color-plate of a village in the Harz Mountains.&#10;&#10;Regarding his way of making a living, Bjornstam describes himself as an independent worker who does odd jobs and remains rude to those he considers &quot;polite cusses&quot; like bank clerks.

    <node id="Through the bartender's experiences and observations of the rowdy behavior of young men at the Minniemashie House and other local establishments, the narrator reveals Carol's understanding that the masculine ideal in this town is associated with vulgarity, disrespect towards women, lack of respect for authority, crude behavior, and materialism. These young men see themselves as virile and amusing based on American fiction they have consumed, and they believe that boys who are not compounded of the gutter and the mining-camp are mollycoddles and unhappy.&#10;&#10;Carol had pity for them initially but kept a distance, viewing them impersonally. However, after overhearing Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock's conversation about her and her husband, she realizes that they have been observing and judging her all along. This makes her feel self-conscious and uncertain of her place in the community, as she now recognizes their judgmental attitude towards her.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol is disappointed to find that the town has its own set of problems despite her hope for a healthier environment than the city. The behavior of these young men reinforces her belief that the town's conservative culture restricts her individuality and social freedom, causing frustration and anger. Therefore, Carol's understanding of masculinity in this town is linked to negative behaviors and attitudes, making it difficult for her to connect with the townspeople and feel a sense of belonging." />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that when Kennicott is absent, Carol feels more exposed and vulnerable to the critical gaze of the townsfolk. This is because Kennicott's presence generally serves as a protective barrier for Carol, helping her feel less conspicuous and more accepted in Gopher Prairie society. Without him, she may feel a heightened sense of isolation and disconnection from the community, as well as increased self-doubt and uncertainty about her place within it.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Kennicott's absence might further highlight Carol's status as an &quot;outsider&quot; or &quot;the girl from the Cities,&quot; making her more susceptible to judgment and criticism based on her differences from the town's traditional values and way of life. Furthermore, without Kennicott there to reassure and support her, Carol may feel more anxious about navigating social situations in Gopher Prairie and defending herself against any perceived or actual criticisms from the townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Overall, the consequences of Kennicott's absence for Carol are primarily emotional and psychological, as she must cope with increased feelings of vulnerability, self-doubt, and isolation during his short trip to Rochester." />
    <node id="The narrator, Carol, longs for a different living situation due to her feelings of loneliness and discontent in the small town of Gopher Prairie. The town's limited cultural and intellectual opportunities have left her feeling bored and unfulfilled after exploring its initial attractions. She had already read most of the books in the local library, attended all the social events, and become a member of various clubs, but still felt dissatisfied and longing for more stimulating experiences (SUPPORTING MATERIALS).&#10;&#10;Carol's feelings of loneliness and discontent are further exacerbated by her status as an &quot;outsider&quot; or &quot;the girl from the Cities,&quot; making her more susceptible to judgment and criticism based on her differences from the town's traditional values and way of life. Kennicott's absence during his short trip to Rochester heightens her sense of isolation, self-doubt, and vulnerability (NARRATIVE).&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol experiences negative consequences after giving in to her desire to run and halloo in public, highlighting the strict social norms of the town and causing her to suppress her youthful and defiant impulses in order to conform to the expectations of a &quot;Nice Married Woman&quot; (NARRATIVE).&#10;&#10;The narrator's understanding of masculinity in this town is also linked to negative behaviors and attitudes, making it difficult for her to connect with the townspeople and feel a sense of belonging. The rowdy behavior of young men at local establishments reinforces her belief that the town's conservative culture restricts her individuality and social freedom, causing frustration and anger (NARRATIVE).&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, Carol has become increasingly close with Bea Sorenson, one of the maids in her household. Their relationship highlights the former's growth in understanding and valuing the townspeople, including those in lower social classes. However, overall, the specific aspects of the town that contribute to Carol's feelings of loneliness and discontent include its limited cultural and intellectual opportunities, strict social norms, conservative culture, and negative behaviors and attitudes towards women and individuality." />

    <edge source="based on the narrative, Carol (Molly) has undergone a change in her perspective towards the boys in her town, specifically after overhearing Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock's conversation. Initially, she viewed the boys impersonally, pitying them but not considering that they might have any interest in her. However, after overhearing their conversation, she becomes aware that they are observing her and judging her, making her feel self-conscious. She is particularly disturbed by the fact that even young boys like Cy Bogart are discussing her husband's personal habits.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol realizes that she may not fit in with the townspeople as much as she thought she did. She wonders if the townsfolk see her as stuck-up and whether they are watching and judging her actions. This realization makes her feel isolated and uncertain about her place in the community.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that Carol's perspective on the boys in her town has shifted from one of detached pity to a recognition of their judgmental attitude towards her. This shift in perspective has made her feel self-conscious and unsure of her place in the community." target="Based on the narrative, it is clear that Carol's experience at the social gathering was a challenging one for her. She had expected to be welcomed and embraced by the townspeople, but instead, she felt like an outsider. The women at the gathering seemed to be judging and gossiping about her, which made her feel self-conscious and paranoid.&#10;&#10;Carol struggled to keep from becoming oversensitive and to avoid appearing unpopular. However, she found it difficult to hide her true feelings when faced with condescending comments and questions about her appearance, her husband's personal habits, and her efforts to fit in with the community. For instance, she responded sharply when Ella Stowbody asked if she planned to send to Minneapolis for her dress for the next soiree.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Carol felt relieved by the admiration of Rita Simons, who looked at the steel buckles on her pumps with admiration. However, she resented Mrs. Howland's tart demand about her new couch and responded defensively, which only served to create more tension between them.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, Carol made an effort to connect with the townspeople by showing interest in their lives and families. She asked after Mrs. McGanum's baby's throat and was attentive while she described symptoms. This approach seemed to be effective, as the contaminated families were gracious towards her.&#10;&#10;When Vida Sherwin and Miss Ethel Villets arrived, Carol felt more confident and began to talk about her experiences driving in the countryside with Will. However, her efforts to connect with the townspeople were short-lived when she discovered that they had been ridiculing her attempts to give them a gay party and her Chinese costume.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is evident that Carol's experience at the social gathering was a difficult one for her. She felt like an outsider and struggled to connect with the townspeople, who seemed to be judging and gossiping about her. Despite these challenges, she made efforts to fit in by showing interest in their lives and families, but ultimately, her attempts were met with ridicule and contempt.">

This doubt may stem from her feeling of not fitting in with the townsfolk and their conventional ways, as well as the judgmental attitude she has become aware of among the boys in town. The trip to Lac-qui-Meurt in the Big Woods helps alleviate this internal struggle by providing Carol with a fresh perspective and boosting her confidence in herself.&#10;&#10;Carol's visit to the Chippewa Indian reservation, Lac-qui-Meurt, allows her to contrast the simplicity and warmth of the Native American community with the superficiality she experiences in Gopher Prairie. By observing the dignified and kind nature of Mrs. Kennicott, Carol gains a deeper understanding of her husband and his family's values, which strengthens her bond with them.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the journey to Lac-qui-Meurt helps Carol realize that she has been too hard on herself, thinking of herself as superior to others when, in reality, everyone shares common imperfections and desires. This realization contributes to her decision not to escape from Gopher Prairie but rather to find meaning and happiness within it by connecting with people more deeply and appreciating the value of community life.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Carol's internal struggle with whether marrying Kennicott was a mistake is closely tied to her dissatisfaction with her life in Gopher Prairie and the lack of connection she feels with its inhabitants. The trip to Lac-qui-Meurt allows her to reevaluate her situation, regain her confidence, and strengthen her relationships, ultimately helping her find happiness within her marriage and community.">

At first, she is referred to as &quot;the girl from the Cities&quot; because she is an outsider who moved to Gopher Prairie from a city, and this shows her unfamiliarity with the rural lifestyle and attitudes of the townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Carol's reaction to learning that Doc Kennicott used to chew tobacco before marrying her is surprise, as it was news to her. This detail about Kennicott's past highlights his small-town roots and contrasts with Carol's more sophisticated upbringing in the city. The fact that Kennicott no longer chews tobacco after marrying Carol also indicates a change in his behavior due to his new domestic life and perhaps a desire to please his wife.">

He is known for his cynical demeanor but is loved by children, who enjoy hearing his improbable stories of sea-faring and horse-trading. Bjornstam can do anything with his hands, making him invaluable to the community during winter preparations. Despite being considered slightly insane and an outsider by some, he is a democrat who treats everyone equally. He is known for wearing a brown dog-skin overcoat and a plush cap that becomes a pulp of ice and coal-dust during his work in the winter.">

Additionally, her actions, such as paying her maids more than the average wage and advocating for change in the town, further reinforce their perception of her as an outsider trying to impose her values on them.&#10;&#10;The townspeople's negative perception of Carol is also influenced by their own prejudices and fears. They view her efforts to reform the town as a threat to their way of life and see her as someone who looks down on them, rather than as someone who wants to help improve their community. This negative perspective creates a barrier between Carol and the townspeople, making it difficult for her to connect with them and create meaningful relationships.&#10;&#10;In summary, the townspeople perceive Carol as an affected reformer because of her use of language, her actions that challenge traditional norms, and their own prejudices and fears. These factors contribute to a negative perspective that creates distance between Carol and the townspeople, making it challenging for her to be accepted and understood in the community.">

She had already read most of the books in the local library, attended all the social events, and become a member of various clubs. Despite these efforts, she still found herself feeling unsatisfied and longing for more stimulating experiences. This suggests that the town may have had limited resources in terms of education, arts, and other forms of cultural enrichment, leaving Carol feeling restricted and confined in her new environment.">

This is because Kennicott's presence generally serves as a protective barrier for Carol, helping her feel less conspicuous and more accepted in Gopher Prairie society. Without him, she may feel a heightened sense of isolation and disconnection from the community, as well as increased self-doubt and uncertainty about her place within it.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Kennicott's absence might further highlight Carol's status as an &quot;outsider&quot; or &quot;the girl from the Cities,&quot; making her more susceptible to judgment and criticism based on her differences from the town's traditional values and way of life. Furthermore, without Kennicott there to reassure and support her, Carol may feel more anxious about navigating social situations in Gopher Prairie and defending herself against any perceived or actual criticisms from the townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Overall, the consequences of Kennicott's absence for Carol are primarily emotional and psychological, as she must cope with increased feelings of vulnerability, self-doubt, and isolation during his short trip to Rochester.">

Winter is not just a season in the North Middlewest; it is an industry that requires constant effort and vigilance. Householders, such as Sam Clark and Mr. Dawson, put up storm sheds at every door and erect storm windows on second-story jambs. Miles Bjornstam, known as &quot;The Red Swede,&quot; plays a crucial role in this process as he is the only person besides the repairman at Sam Clark's who understands plumbing. He becomes the commissioner general of Gopher Prairie during winter, rushing from house to house to look over furnaces and water pipes.&#10;&#10;Miles Bjornstam is a tall, thick, red-mustached bachelor with an opinionated atheist and general-store arguer. He is known for his cynical demeanor but is loved by children, who enjoy hearing his improbable stories of sea-faring and horse-trading. Bjornstam can do anything with his hands, making him invaluable to the community during winter preparations. Despite being considered slightly insane and an outsider by some, he is a democrat who treats everyone equally. He is known for wearing a brown dog-skin overcoat and a plush cap that becomes a pulp of ice and coal-dust during his work in the winter.">

Winter is not just a season in the North Middlewest; it is an industry that requires constant effort and vigilance. Householders, such as Sam Clark and Mr. Dawson, put up storm sheds at every door and erect storm windows on second-story jambs. Miles Bjornstam, known as &quot;The Red Swede,&quot; plays a crucial role in this process as he is the only person besides the repairman at Sam Clark's who understands plumbing. He becomes the commissioner general of Gopher Prairie during winter, rushing from house to house to look over furnaces and water pipes.&#10;&#10;Miles Bjornstam is a tall, thick, red-mustached bachelor with an opinionated atheist and general-store arguer. He is known for his cynical demeanor but is loved by children, who enjoy hearing his improbable stories of sea-faring and horse-trading. Bjornstam can do anything with his hands, making him invaluable to the community during winter preparations. Despite being considered slightly insane and an outsider by some, he is a democrat who treats everyone equally. He is known for wearing a brown dog-skin overcoat and a plush cap that becomes a pulp of ice and coal-dust during his work in the winter.">

    <edge source="In the narrative, Carol experiences negative consequences after giving in to her desire to run and halloo in public. When she gallops down a block and jumps over a curb, she is met with the disapproving gazes of three old women and notices that the curtain had moved at another window across the street, indicating that her behavior was being watched and judged by the townspeople. This makes Carol feel self-conscious and aware of the strict social norms of the town, causing her to suppress her youthful and defiant impulses in order to conform to the expectations of a &quot;Nice Married Woman.&quot; As a result, she attends the next weekly bridge of the Jolly Seventeen sedately and feeling confined by her new identity. This experience further emphasizes the limitations placed on Carol by the town's conservative culture and highlights her struggles to balance her desires for individuality and social acceptance." target="The narrator, Carol, longs for a different living situation due to her feelings of loneliness and discontent in the small town of Gopher Prairie. The town's limited cultural and intellectual opportunities have left her feeling bored and unfulfilled after exploring its initial attractions. She had already read most of the books in the local library, attended all the social events, and become a member of various clubs, but still felt dissatisfied and longing for more stimulating experiences (SUPPORTING MATERIALS).&#10;&#10;Carol's feelings of loneliness and discontent are further exacerbated by her status as an &quot;outsider&quot; or &quot;the girl from the Cities,&quot; making her more susceptible to judgment and criticism based on her differences from the town's traditional values and way of life. Kennicott's absence during his short trip to Rochester heightens her sense of isolation, self-doubt, and vulnerability (NARRATIVE).&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol experiences negative consequences after giving in to her desire to run and halloo in public, highlighting the strict social norms of the town and causing her to suppress her youthful and defiant impulses in order to conform to the expectations of a &quot;Nice Married Woman&quot; (NARRATIVE).&#10;&#10;The narrator's understanding of masculinity in this town is also linked to negative behaviors and attitudes, making it difficult for her to connect with the townspeople and feel a sense of belonging. The rowdy behavior of young men at local establishments reinforces her belief that the town's conservative culture restricts her individuality and social freedom, causing frustration and anger (NARRATIVE).&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, Carol has become increasingly close with Bea Sorenson, one of the maids in her household. Their relationship highlights the former's growth in understanding and valuing the townspeople, including those in lower social classes. However, overall, the specific aspects of the town that contribute to Carol's feelings of loneliness and discontent include its limited cultural and intellectual opportunities, strict social norms, conservative culture, and negative behaviors and attitudes towards women and individuality.">

This revelation contributed to her decision not to escape from Gopher Prairie but rather to find meaning and happiness within it by connecting with people more deeply and appreciating the value of community life.&#10;&#10;Upon their return to Gopher Prairie on a bright, windy winter day, Kennicott was cheerful and greeted friends as they walked through town. Carol, now more accepting of her life in Gopher Prairie, took part in organizing outdoor sports in the motor-paralyzed town, further connecting with the community and finding happiness within it.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's trip to Lac-qui-Meurt allowed her to reevaluate her situation, regain her confidence, and strengthen her relationships, ultimately helping her find happiness within her marriage and community. Upon their return, both Carol and Kennicott were in good spirits, greeting friends and participating in town activities together." target="The narrative suggests that when Kennicott is absent, Carol feels more exposed and vulnerable to the critical gaze of the townsfolk. This is because Kennicott's presence generally serves as a protective barrier for Carol, helping her feel less conspicuous and more accepted in Gopher Prairie society. Without him, she may feel a heightened sense of isolation and disconnection from the community, as well as increased self-doubt and uncertainty about her place within it.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Kennicott's absence might further highlight Carol's status as an &quot;outsider&quot; or &quot;the girl from the Cities,&quot; making her more susceptible to judgment and criticism based on her differences from the town's traditional values and way of life. Furthermore, without Kennicott there to reassure and support her, Carol may feel more anxious about navigating social situations in Gopher Prairie and defending herself against any perceived or actual criticisms from the townsfolk.&#10;&#10;Overall, the consequences of Kennicott's absence for Carol are primarily emotional and psychological, as she must cope with increased feelings of vulnerability, self-doubt, and isolation during his short trip to Rochester.">

These young men see themselves as virile and amusing based on American fiction they have consumed, and they believe that boys who are not compounded of the gutter and the mining-camp are mollycoddles and unhappy.&#10;&#10;Carol had pity for them initially but kept a distance, viewing them impersonally. However, after overhearing Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock's conversation about her and her husband, she realizes that they have been observing and judging her all along. This makes her feel self-conscious and uncertain of her place in the community, as she now recognizes their judgmental attitude towards her.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol is disappointed to find that the town has its own set of problems despite her hope for a healthier environment than the city. The behavior of these young men reinforces her belief that the town's conservative culture restricts her individuality and social freedom, causing frustration and anger.

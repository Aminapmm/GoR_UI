    <node id="1. The bomb at Lupus V was discovered unexploded, despite being detonated, due to a cut detonating wire.&#10;2. This occurred before an alien attack on the colony, suggesting that someone or something had prior knowledge of the attack and intentionally prevented the bomb from exploding.&#10;3. The colonists speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire, possibly due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules.&#10;4. However, this explanation is less likely given the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;5. The precise nature and origin of the &quot;something&quot; that prevented the bomb from exploding remain mysterious and unexplained." />
    <node id=" quiet place a long way from home. Late in the year 2360—the exact date remains unknown—an alien force attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and the dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the army.&#10; &#10; When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists, thirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children, were missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines, even books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were the bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had, nobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier finally stumbled on something.&#10; &#10; For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main buildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be buried in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow a whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn vital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb at Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The detonating wire had been cut.&#10; &#10; In the heart" />
    <node id=", but I never....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You think one of your people did it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rossel stared at him. &quot;Isn't that obvious?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like most government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was silent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,&#10;&quot;Maybe an animal?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan shook his head. &quot;No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or found it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think? The wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one is cut too—newly cut.&quot;&#10; &#10; The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.&#10; &#10; &quot;So something,&quot; said Dylan, &quot;knew enough about this camp to know that a bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that something didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the center of the camp" />

A moment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.&#10; &#10; &quot;Was he drunk ?&quot; Rossel began angrily. &quot;Was that a bottle of liquor ?&quot;&#10; &#10; The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the envelope in Rossel's hand. &quot;You'd better read that and get moving. We haven't much time.&quot;&#10; &#10; He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As Rossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but could not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch that, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy clouds and the cold.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The first contact Man had ever had with an intelligent alien race occurred out on the perimeter in a small quiet place a long way from home. Late in the year 2360—the exact date remains unknown—an alien force attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus" />
    <node id=" bomb at Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The detonating wire had been cut.&#10; &#10; In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of earth, the wire had been dug up and cut.&#10; &#10; The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five hundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small, weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread the news, and Man began to fall back.&#10; &#10; In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won stars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of the colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died in fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those ships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a society which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only defense Earth had.&#10; &#10; This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth with a bottle on his hip.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well sh" />
    <node id=" Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay quietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow, thanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he would not have to venture out into that miserable cold.&#10; &#10; Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with uncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was distinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could take no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single button, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling of the colonists' ship.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow, thinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later the realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three had never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard the signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was all they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered. There was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He checked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the air was as" />
    <node id=" &quot;we'll do what we can. Maybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.&quot;&#10; &#10; The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around him and the scurrying people.&#10; &#10; &quot;Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan shook his head. &quot;The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.&quot; Because the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but he said, as kindly as he could, &quot;We'll get 'em all out. One way or another, we won't leave anybody.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had happened.&#10; &#10; Dylan showed him the two clean ends. &quot;Somebody dug it up, cut it, then buried it again and packed it down real nice.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The damn fool!&quot; Rossel exploded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Who?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on a live bomb like this, but I never....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You think one of your people did it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rossel stared at him. &quot;Isn't that" />
    <node id="1. Dylan's detachment from losing the core of himself can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military bars or jails. He has become numb and indifferent to the idea of not being able to regain his lost self, feeling that it makes no particular difference. This mindset is reflected in his actions and reactions throughout the story.&#10;&#10;2. When Dylan realizes the wire has been cut, he initially reacts with shock but quickly recovers due to his expectation of such an event. The clean and bright end of the wire suggests a deliberate action rather than an accident, leading him to consider possible explanations for this occurrence. He feels a sense of urgency, as this incident indicates that something or someone doesn't want the camp destroyed, but also experiences irritation when Rossel leans on him.&#10;&#10;3. Rossel then asks about the capacity of Dylan's ship because their own ship is overloaded, carrying 60 people while only having room for 40. The urgency in Rossel's question stems from the fact that they need to evacuate some members of their group due to the overload. Dylan reacts by feeling light-headed and knowing that someone will have to stay behind and face the unknown threat, realizing it might be him." />
    <node id=" it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of the bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults which are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the core of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point: it made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed nobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something pleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands.&#10; &#10; Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it threw him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire had just been cut.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his hands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and then, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real, there was no time for that.&#10; &#10; When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he did not notice the wire.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan looked at him" />
    <node id=" bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that something didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the center of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then walked right out again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen,&quot; said Rossel, &quot;I'd better go ask.&quot;&#10; &#10; He started away but Dylan caught his arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;Tell them to arm,&quot; he said, &quot;and try not to scare hell out of them. I'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his hands.&#10; &#10; He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that he'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was perhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.&#10; &#10; All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How? Telepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?&#10; &#10; No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there would be no need for an attack. But you don't" />
    <node id=" so excited he did not notice the wire.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan looked at him vaguely. &quot;She sleeps two and won't take off with more'n ten. Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.&#10;&quot;We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take forty. We came out in groups, we never thought....&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. &quot;You're sure? No baggage, no iron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck—she's all we could afford.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. &quot;It 'pears that somebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. &quot;All right,&quot; he said quickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, &quot;we'll do what we can. Maybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.&quot;&#10; &#10; The colonist had begun" />
    <node id=" no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He checked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the air was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan.&#10; &#10; Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what he felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said hopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the men in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and he was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what would have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But even stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he realized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then that he thought of Bossio.&#10; &#10; Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three was dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was gone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow. More than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken, unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge" />
    <node id=" but he said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at the same time, because now they were coming to him.&#10; &#10; He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it was bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they wouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their ship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put a call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only answer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and he wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you could not blame him.&#10; &#10; Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man—who turned out to be Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically cleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might get the rest of the folks out on that.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan shrugged. &quot;Don't count on it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But they have a contract!&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The message from Fleet Headquarters that Captain Dylan receives in an envelope is not explicitly stated in the text. However, it can be inferred that the message contains important information or instructions, as evidenced by the thick, official-looking appearance of the envelope and Rossel's question about whether Dylan had a message for him.&#10;&#10;2. The significance of the young man's arrival and behavior is related to the tension and urgency surrounding the situation at the military base. The young man's presence in the airlock of the hovering ship, his call to Dylan, and his tossing down of a bottle all suggest a sense of casualness or nonchalance in the face of danger. This behavior may serve to heighten the contrast between Dylan's calm and professional demeanor and the recklessness of some of the other characters in the story." />
    <node id=" tears gathering in the ends of his eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Captain Dylan, sir.&quot; His voice was low and did not carry. &quot;I have a message from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. &quot;Nobody's in charge here. If you want a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?&quot;&#10; &#10; The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes. Then he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel. It was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He was about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the hovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man appeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.&#10; &#10; &quot;C'n I go now, Jim?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan turned and nodded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Be back for you tonight,&quot; the young man called, and then, grinning, he yelled &quot;Catch&quot; and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and put it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A moment later the airlock closed" />
    <node id=" anger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and confronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.&#10; &#10; &quot;See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our home . We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been paying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you earned your keep. We demand....&quot;&#10; &#10; It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped that he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him now and giving him that name of ancient contempt, &quot;soldier boy.&quot; The gloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was.&#10; &#10; &quot;There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that were obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for the brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Dylan wanted to go on about that, to remind them that nobody had wanted the army, that the fleet had grown smaller and smaller ... but this was not the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be coming in right now for all he" />
    <node id=" grown smaller and smaller ... but this was not the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be coming in right now for all he knew, and all they did was talk. He had realized a long time ago that no peace-loving nation in the history of Earth had ever kept itself strong, and although peace was a noble dream, it was ended now and it was time to move.&#10; &#10; &quot;We'd better get going,&quot; he finally said, and there was quiet.&#10;&quot;Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of this system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed to have you gone by then.&quot;&#10; &#10; For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and the rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two stopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man said he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off his planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to check the bomb, grateful for the action.&#10; &#10; Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the radio shack" />
    <node id=" anybody could do but stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing wall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until there was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights and the snow.&#10; &#10; By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to try to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still didn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window through the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which were beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still drunk—maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan held no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind of guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be waiting....&#10; &#10; A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the shack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like to know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but he said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at the same time, because now they were coming to him.&#10; &#10; He pushed" />
    <node id="1. The man (Captain Dylan) feels a mixture of pleasure and irritation after being asked if they can stay on his ship because he is both flattered and annoyed by the request. On one hand, he takes pleasure in being relied upon, but on the other hand, he is irritated by the fact that they are putting him in a difficult position, as there might not be enough space or resources for them on his ship.&#10;&#10;2. Rossel hasn't contacted the mail ship yet to ask about room on board because he knows that there is no room available on the ship. He wants to put off delivering the bad news as long as possible, as he understands the urgency of finding a safe place for their group. This is evident when Dylan realizes the wire has been cut and urges Rossel to contact Three, but Rossel hesitates because he already knows the answer." />
    <node id="1. The viggle is a large animal that exists in the location of the military base where the story takes place. It is described as being similar to a monkey but with four legs, and it is known to get pesky enough for the colonists to shoot them occasionally.&#10;2. The significance of the viggle in relation to the characters' decision to post sentries is that it serves as a reminder of the potential dangers present in the environment beyond the military base. While the colonists have not yet encountered any hostile alien life, they are aware that there are potentially dangerous animals on the planet. By posting sentries, the colonists are taking precautions to ensure their safety and protect themselves from any potential threats, whether they be animal or alien in nature." />
    <node id=" if one of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rush calmly—at least outwardly calmly—lit his pipe. There was a strength in this man that Dylan had missed before.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't know,&quot; he said gruffly. &quot;But these are aliens, mister. And until I know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.&quot;&#10; &#10; He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending.&#10; &#10; Then Rossel jumped. &quot;My God!&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan moved to quiet him. &quot;Look, is there any animal at all that ever comes near here that's as large as a dog?&quot;&#10; &#10; After a pause, Rush answered. &quot;Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like a reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we landed. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky.&quot; He rose slowly, the rifle held under his arm. &quot;I b'lieve we might just as well go post them sentries.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to say. Rossel went" />
    <node id=" might just as well go post them sentries.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to say. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained expression on his face, to put through that call to Three.&#10; &#10; When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, &quot;Where you want them sentries? I got Walt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow.&#10;&quot;You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises, within calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five minutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.&quot;&#10; &#10; The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. &quot;Nice day for huntin',&quot; he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering his footprints.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide warm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae; curiously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans come. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and" />
    <node id="?&#10; &#10; No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there would be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really know.&#10; &#10; Were they small? Little animals?&#10; &#10; Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable brain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large as a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long before a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly shown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.&#10; &#10; He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.&#10; &#10; He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he straightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out his pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last time he had fired it. He never had—he never had fired a gun.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do but stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing wall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness," />
    <node id="1. Dylan interacts with Rossel, a small sober man who is in charge at the military base, in a calm and professional manner. When Dylan receives a message from Fleet Headquarters, he hands it to Rossel, who appears to be the person in charge at the base. The tension and urgency of the situation are heightened when a young man arrives in the airlock of the hovering ship and tosses down a bottle, while Dylan remains unconcerned.&#10;2. Later, Dylan reveals the true state of the fleet to Rossel and the other colonists who demand protection from the fleet. He tells them that there is no fleet, only a few hundred half-shot old tubs and a few new jobs for the brass and government. This revelation highlights the reality of their situation and emphasizes the danger they are in.&#10;3. Dylan's interaction with Rossel shows his detachment from the situation, which can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military bars or jails. He has become numb and indifferent to the idea of not being able to regain his lost self, feeling that it makes no particular difference. This mindset is reflected in his actions and reactions throughout the story, including his calm demeanor when interacting with Rossel." />
    <node id="The army was unable to understand why the bomb at Lupus V did not explode despite being detonated. This was due to the detonating wire being cut, which required knowledge of government rules and potentially advanced technology. The army was small, weak, and without respect after 500 years of peace and anti-war conditioning, leaving them unable to effectively respond to this situation. As a result, the colonists had to fall back to Earth, leaving the veterans on ships as their only defense." />
    <node id="1. Telepathy or mind control: Dylan considers the possibility of an alien entity possessing telepathic abilities or the capacity to control human minds. This would allow it to manipulate someone within the camp to cut the wire and prevent the explosion.&#10;&#10;2. Advanced technology: The clean and precise cut on the detonating wire suggests the use of advanced technology, potentially belonging to an alien force, capable of carrying out such a precise action without causing accidental damage to the wire.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide definitive evidence regarding who or what cut the wire. However, the carefully planned actions required to prevent the explosion suggest that an intelligent being, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, might be responsible for this incident." />
    <node id="1. The heart-wrenching reason behind Dylan's grief is the realization that his only friend, Bossio, has died while trying to help a group of people who had previously mistreated him. This loss is compounded by the fact that Dylan had considered Bossio as his sole companion in the vast and indifferent universe, making his death even more difficult to accept.&#10;2. The vow Dylan makes is in response to the grief he feels for Bossio's death and a sense of responsibility towards the people who are now looking up to him for help. Despite their past mistreatment of Bossio, these people have begun to view Dylan as their hope for survival, leading him to swear that he will stay behind and risk his life to save one of them.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's grief and vow stem from the tragic loss of his only friend, Bossio, who died while trying to help a group of people who had previously mistreated him. The realization that someone needs to stay behind to save an unknown person's life further intensifies his emotional response, ultimately leading him to make a selfless vow to protect a stranger despite the dangers he will face." />
    <node id=" Dylan stood rooted in the snow. More than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken, unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead—the one thing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had. In all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his friendship and his trust.&#10; &#10; He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the people were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were beginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him with hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore.&#10; &#10; Bossio—a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no grudges—Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried to help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days of his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and die to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four hours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company. Now, when it was far, far too late, they were coming" />
    <node id="1. The army captain, Dylan, is unable to help the people who have come to him for assistance because he received a message from Fleet Headquarters stating the true state of the fleet, which is that there are only a few hundred half-shot old tubs and a few new jobs for the brass and government. This means that they do not have the resources or capability to provide assistance to the people who need it.&#10;2. Dylan feels gratitude toward the old woman's kind gesture because he is deeply traumatized and cynical from his time in the military bars or jails, which has made him numb and indifferent to the idea of not being able to regain his lost self. The old woman's kindness serves as a reminder that there are still good people in the world, despite the harsh realities he has faced. This contrast between the old woman's kindness and the cruelty of the military world he is used to evokes a strong emotional response from him, leading him to feel grateful for her gesture." />
    <node id="; in the morning, it was misty and cold. By eight o'clock a wet, heavy, snow-smelling breeze had begun to set in, and because the crops were all down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee and remained inside. The wind blew steadily, icily from the north. It was well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship landed in a field near the settlement.&#10; &#10; There was still time. There were some last brief moments in which the colonists could act and feel as they had always done. They therefore grumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had convenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but no one went out to greet them.&#10; &#10; After a while a rather tall, frail-looking man came out of the ship and stood upon the hard ground looking toward the village. He remained there, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. It was a silly thing to do. He was obviously not coming in, either out of pride or just plain orneriness.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, I never,&quot; a nice lady said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's he just standing there for?&quot; another lady said." />

The seed of peace was deeply planted in these people, in the children and the women, very, very deep. And because they had been taught, oh so carefully, to hate war they had also been taught, quite incidentally, to despise soldiers.&#10; &#10; The lone man kept standing in the freezing wind.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and pathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out in that miserable cold to meet him.&#10; &#10; The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not too clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than Rossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were tears gathering in the ends of his eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Captain Dylan, sir.&quot; His voice was low and did not carry. &quot;I have a message" />
    <node id="The heart-wrenching situation occurs when Dylan realizes that his only friend, Bossio, has died while trying to help a group of people on Planet Three. These people had previously mistreated Bossio, but now they look up to Dylan as their hope for survival. Despite his grief and the fact that he had never known or cared for these people before, Dylan makes a selfless vow to stay behind and risk his life to save one of them. This decision is made even more difficult for Dylan as he grapples with Bossio's death, as Bossio was his only friend and companion in the vast universe. The reality of this situation is further intensified by the weather conditions, as a snowstorm rolls in, making it impossible for anyone to leave Planet Three. Dylan comes to accept this reality, and begins to help the people prepare for their departure, ultimately realizing that he himself will have to stay behind and face danger for their sake." />
    <node id="1. Based on Dylan's directions, Rush should post the sentries in a ring around the perimeter of the site, on rises within calling distance of each other. This will allow them to have clear visibility and provide overlapping fields of view, which will increase their ability to detect any potential threats.&#10;2. Rush should instruct the sentries to check in with each other every five minutes. This will help ensure that they remain alert and aware of their surroundings, as well as enable them to quickly respond to any suspicious activity or threats. Additionally, it will allow them to coordinate their responses and provide backup if necessary.&#10;3. Rush should also inform the sentries of the need to be on the lookout for any animals or creatures that may pose a threat, such as the viggle, which can be as large as a dog. This will help ensure that they are prepared for any potential encounters and can take appropriate action if necessary.&#10;4. Finally, Rush should stress the importance of remaining calm and focused, even in the face of potential danger. Dylan's demeanor throughout the story demonstrates the value of maintaining a professional and level-headed approach, even when under pressure or in tense situations. By following these instructions, Rush can help ensure that his sentries are well-prepared to handle any threats or challenges that may arise during their watch." />
    <node id="At the Lupus V colony in 2360, an alien force attacked and destroyed the colony, resulting in the death of thirty-one colonists and the disappearance of the rest. All technical equipment, including radios, guns, machines, even books, were missing, and the buildings had been burned, suggesting the aliens had a heat ray. The bomb in the main building had been detonated but failed to explode due to a cut detonating wire, indicating prior knowledge of the attack and potentially advanced technology or an insider's involvement. This event left the army unable to effectively respond, resulting in colonists having to fall back to Earth, with veterans on ships as their only defense." />
    <node id="1. The ship couldn't take off with the colonists when Dylan experienced an unexpected sense of sympathy for his people and realized their shared bond in the face of great trouble because it was already overloaded. The ship had a maximum capacity of 10 passengers, but there were 60 colonists who needed to be evacuated. This means that even if all the colonists could fit into Dylan's ship, it still wouldn't be enough to accommodate everyone.&#10;2. The cause of the ship's failure to lift off was a sharp burning smell that occurred when the ship tried to take off with the colonists. Although the text does not explicitly state the reason for this malfunction, it can be inferred that it was due to the overloading of the ship beyond its weight capacity or safe operational limits. This would have put undue strain on the engines and other critical systems, making it impossible for the ship to lift off from the ground." />
    <node id=" Children went automatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The elders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep themselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.&#10; &#10; In the end, the ship took forty-six people.&#10; &#10; Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him standing by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried in her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected, rose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went slipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never understood before, because he had never once been among men in great trouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while there was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and the airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp burning smell—she couldn't get off the ground." />
    <node id="1. The suspicious and dismissive attitude of the people towards the soldier (Captain Dylan) standing in the freezing wind is due to their deep-seated prejudice against soldiers, as they have been taught to hate war and consequently despise soldiers. They assume that Dylan is drunk, further highlighting their negative perception of soldiers.&#10;2. The significance of Captain Dylan's appearance and message for Bob Rossel lies in the fact that Dylan brings important information from Fleet Headquarters, which is likely crucial for the situation at the military base. This is evident by the thick, official-looking appearance of the envelope containing the message. The urgency of the situation is further emphasized when a young man arrives in the airlock of the hovering ship and tosses down a bottle, while Dylan remains unconcerned. Dylan's calm demeanor and professionalism contrast sharply with the recklessness of the young man, adding tension to the scene." />
    <node id="1. Dylan's detachment from losing the core of himself can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military bars or jails. He has become numb and indifferent to the idea of not being able to regain his lost self, feeling that it makes no particular difference. This mindset is reflected in his actions and reactions throughout the story.&#10;2. Dylan's habit of reaching for a bottle of alcohol is a coping mechanism for him, likely developed over his time in difficult circumstances within the military. However, when he realizes that the wire has been cut, he abandons this habit temporarily due to the urgency and surprise of the situation. The clean and bright end of the wire suggests a deliberate action rather than an accident, leading him to consider possible explanations for this occurrence. He feels a sense of urgency, as this incident indicates that something or someone doesn't want the camp destroyed, but also experiences irritation when Rossel leans on him. This heightened state of awareness and focus makes him less inclined to resort to his usual coping mechanism in this specific moment." />
    <node id="1. The bomb at Lupus V was discovered unexploded despite being detonated due to a cut detonating wire.&#10;2. This occurred before an alien attack on the colony, suggesting that someone or something had prior knowledge of the attack and intentionally prevented the bomb from exploding.&#10;3. The precise nature and origin of the &quot;something&quot; that prevented the bomb from exploding remain mysterious and unexplained.&#10;4. The cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack, further suggests advanced technology or insider involvement.&#10;5. The army was unable to effectively respond to the situation due to being small, weak, and without respect after 500 years of peace and anti-war conditioning.&#10;6. Colonists had to fall back to Earth, leaving veterans on ships as their only defense." />
    <node id="1. The Scandinavian legend about the Warrior in the northland cave serves as a metaphor for the military and its role in society. In times of peace, people tend to forget or dismiss the importance of soldiers and their duties. However, when faced with danger or a crisis, people turn to the military for help and protection. The legend emphasizes the timeless need for soldiers and their role in ensuring the safety and security of society.&#10;2. The misty and cold morning with an approaching snowstorm could be symbolic of the impending crisis facing the military base. Just as the snowstorm arrives unexpectedly, the danger at the base emerges without warning. This weather description helps create a sense of tension and urgency in the story, foreshadowing the arrival of Captain Dylan and his important message from Fleet Headquarters.&#10;3. Together, the Scandinavian legend and the cold, snowy morning establish an ominous tone, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and the value of having a strong military presence, even during times of peace. When faced with adversity or danger, people often rely on soldiers to protect them, as depicted in both the legend and the story's events." />

    <node id="1. The story suggests that an intelligent being, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, dug up and cut the wire to prevent the explosion and protect the camp from destruction. This is inferred from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;&#10;2. The colonists initially speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules. However, this explanation becomes less likely when considering the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, it is reasonable to infer that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction, given their prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack." />
    <node id="1. In the face of imminent danger from the aliens and the growing resentment among the colonists, Dylan and the pioneers must work together to ensure their survival. They need to establish a plan for defending themselves against potential attacks, which may include setting up watch systems, building barriers or weapons, and coordinating evacuation efforts if necessary.&#10;2. Dylan, as a soldier and an outcast, might have to take charge of the situation due to his military background and experience. He should use his skills to guide the pioneers in making strategic decisions and maintaining order within the group. This includes managing conflicts, addressing concerns, and ensuring that everyone is prepared for any possible threat.&#10;3. Additionally, Dylan must find a way to regain the trust and support of the colonists despite their growing resentment. He can do this by being transparent about the situation, sharing vital information, and making it clear that he is committed to their safety and well-being. By demonstrating leadership and empathy, Dylan can help unite the pioneers and strengthen their resolve in facing the challenges ahead." />

But at least this was better than the wailing of the cities.&#10; &#10; This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all by any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an outcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing. He stirred restlessly.&#10; &#10; By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much to say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: &quot;Lupus, Lupus—doesn't that mean wolves or something?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very possible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for discussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the hell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it.&#10; &#10; But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of women began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their anger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and confronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.&#10; &#10; &quot;See here, soldier," />

One by one the colonists were beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great suddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait, between acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage.&#10; &#10; Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those in the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan grinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake it and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly and inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and impregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set up automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever having lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home out of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But at least this was better than the wailing of the cities.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="1. Dylan, a nineteen-year-old boy, became a captain after his father died from a hernia and he was sent along with other kids and a broken-down doctor for anti-war conditioning on the Rim. The conditioning was not strong at that time, and they often talked about guardians of the frontier. After thirty years of bumming around space and experiencing the harsh realities of military life, Dylan became a captain waiting for something to happen on the edge of Mankind.&#10;2. When the story begins, Dylan is facing an approaching event that he can no longer do anything but accept. He feels numb and indifferent due to his traumatic experiences in military bars or jails. However, when an old woman shows him kindness, it evokes a strong emotional response, making him feel grateful for her gesture. The contrast between the old woman's kindness and the cruelty of the military world he is used to has a profound impact on him.&#10;&#10;The text does not explicitly mention Dylan's feelings about the approaching event; however, based on his actions and demeanor, it can be inferred that he feels overwhelmed and helpless. Despite this, when faced with the responsibility of protecting the people who now look up to him as their hope for survival, he rises to the occasion and makes a selfless vow to stay behind and risk his life for them. This decision demonstrates Dylan's growth as a character and his capacity for compassion, even in the face of adversity." />

Damn it, he'd been green. But he'd been only nineteen when his father died—of a hernia, of a crazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked too long on a heavy planet—and in those days the anti-war conditioning out on the Rim was not very strong. They talked a lot about guardians of the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down doctor. And ... now he was a captain.&#10; &#10; He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait and the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days was upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell with it and go home.

This would be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him. After thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk, a man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like that. It would take time.&#10; &#10; He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip.&#10; &#10; Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain. Well, that was nice.

    <node id="1. Dylan is planning to seek assistance from the colony on Planet Three, as he mentions calling Bossio to ask about available space. He also intends to contact any fleet ships within radio distance, although he knows that the fleet is currently spread thin. By exploring these options, Dylan and the colonists hope to find a way to transport all sixty people to their intended colony.&#10;2. Additionally, Dylan has taken it upon himself to ensure the safety of the group by checking the bomb, demonstrating his commitment to their well-being despite the challenges they face. This proactive step, along with his efforts to unite and support the pioneers, will help build trust and foster a sense of solidarity as they work together to overcome their situation." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, it is suggested that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction. This inference comes from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;2. The story does not provide a definitive explanation of how the extraterrestrial entity prevented the camp from being destroyed without controlling the actions of those within the camp. Dylan considers possibilities such as telepathy or mind control, but these are not confirmed in the story. The exact method remains mysterious and unexplained." />
    <node id="1. Dylan's detached attitude towards losing the core of himself can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military bars or jails. He has become numb and indifferent to the idea of not being able to regain his lost self, feeling that it makes no particular difference. This mindset is reflected in his actions and reactions throughout the story, including when the wire comes loose in his hands and he temporarily abandons his habit of reaching for a bottle of alcohol.&#10;2. When the wire snaps, Dylan experiences shock but quickly recovers due to his expectation of such an event. The urgency of this incident indicates that something or someone doesn't want the camp destroyed. In this specific moment, the heightened state of awareness and focus required to understand why the wire was cut makes him less inclined to resort to his usual coping mechanism, which is reaching for a bottle of alcohol.&#10;3. Therefore, Dylan's reaction when the wire comes loose is related to his detached attitude towards losing the core of himself. The sudden realization and urgency of the situation prompt him to focus on the present danger rather than turning to his automatic reliance on alcohol." />
    <node id="1. Dylan is reflecting on his military background and skills, as well as his role as an outcast. He may be considering how these aspects of his life have shaped him and might help him navigate the current dangerous situation with the aliens and the tensions among the colonists. His experiences in the military could prove valuable in making strategic decisions and maintaining order within the group.&#10;2. Dylan is also contemplating the loss of trust from the colonists due to their growing resentment towards him. He realizes that regaining this trust is crucial for uniting the pioneers and strengthening their resolve in facing the challenges ahead. This reflection prompts him to be transparent, share vital information, and demonstrate leadership and empathy.&#10;3. Furthermore, Dylan might be pondering his detachment from the situation as a result of trauma and cynicism experienced during his military service. He may need to confront these feelings and find ways to reconnect with his fellow colonists in order to ensure their collective safety and well-being.&#10;4. Lastly, Dylan could be reflecting on his personal journey and the concept of identity, as suggested by his calm demeanor when interacting with Rossel. He might be contemplating the idea that regaining his lost self may not be possible or significant in light of their current predicament, choosing instead to focus on the shared bond he has with the colonists in facing great trouble together." />
    <node id="1. The colonists' radio communications were disabled by an alien force using a device that sent out powerful electromagnetic pulses, frying their electronic devices and rendering them inoperable. This is evidenced when Rossel tries to contact &quot;Three&quot; but hears no static or interference - the radio just doesn't work anymore.&#10;2. As for why Rossel is unable to reach &quot;Three&quot; through the radio, it's because the alien force not only disabled their communications at this location but also likely took control of any outgoing signals, preventing them from sending a distress call. The text suggests that they have some level of understanding about human technology and communication systems. Additionally, after disabling the colonists' ship, the aliens probably left without leaving any functional communication equipment behind." />
    <node id="1. Dylan has a sudden realization when he sees that the wire has been cut cleanly and brightly, indicating a deliberate action rather than an accident. This makes him consider possible explanations for this occurrence and feel a sense of urgency, as it suggests that something or someone doesn't want the camp destroyed. He also experiences irritation when Rossel leans on him, which contributes to his decision to let go of the bottle.&#10;2. The significance of the number of people Dylan's ship can take is related to the urgent situation at the military base. Rossel asks about the capacity of Dylan's ship because their own ship is overloaded, carrying 60 people while only having room for 40. He needs to evacuate some members of their group due to the overload, and Dylan's ship may be their only viable option for escape. The urgency in Rossel's question stems from this necessity to find a safe place for their group as soon as possible." />
    <node id="1. Dylan's detachment from losing his identity can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military, leading him to become numb and indifferent to not being able to regain his lost self. This mindset is reflected in his actions throughout the story, such as temporarily abandoning his habit of reaching for a bottle of alcohol when the wire comes loose in his hands (story excerpt 1).&#10;   &#10;2. The unexpected discovery of a cut wire signifies that something urgent and real is happening, which requires Dylan's full attention and immediate action. In this situation, he cannot resort to his usual coping mechanism (reaching for alcohol) because the heightened state of awareness and focus required to understand why the wire was cut makes him less inclined to do so (story excerpt 2). The urgency of the situation demands that Dylan deal with the present danger instead of falling back on his automatic reliance on alcohol.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's detachment from losing his identity stems from past traumas and cynicism, while the absence of his usual reaction to discovering a cut wire indicates a heightened sense of urgency and focus on the present situation, which requires immediate action rather than escaping through alcohol." />
    <node id="1. The story implies that Dylan had a military background before becoming an outcast and spending thirty years &quot;bumming around&quot; and drinking. However, the specific reason for his transformation from a drunkard to a responsible captain is not detailed in the provided text. It could be due to a life-changing event or personal crisis that led him to reevaluate his choices and take up responsibility.&#10;2. Dylan's military skills and experience are recognized by whoever calls him up to serve as a captain, which highlights the urgency of the situation. The colonies need someone with knowledge on how to handle tense situations, like defusing a bomb and clearing out colonies, tasks that require military expertise.&#10;3. Dylan's new role as a captain might also be a result of him being one of the few available people with a military background, now that the army is small, weak, and without respect after 500 years of peace and anti-war conditioning. The army ships filled with drinkers, gamblers, and veterans are the only defense Earth has at the moment, and Dylan is one of those veterans.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's past military background and the urgent need for someone experienced in military strategies led to him being called up as a captain after thirty years of bumming around and playing the town drunk. The specific reason for his transformation isn't mentioned in the provided story." />
    <node id="1. The heart-wrenching reason behind Dylan's grief is the realization that his only friend, Bossio, has died while trying to help a group of people on Planet Three. These people had previously mistreated Bossio, but now they look up to Dylan as their hope for survival. Dylan grapples with Bossio's death, as Bossio was his only friend and companion in the vast universe, making his loss even more difficult to accept.&#10;2. The determination to stay behind and risk his life for a stranger stems from Dylan's grief and a sense of responsibility towards the people who are now looking up to him for help. Despite their past mistreatment of Bossio, these people have begun to view Dylan as their hope for survival, leading him to swear that he will stay behind and save one of them. This decision is further solidified by the harsh environment and the fact that he himself will have to stay behind and face danger for their sake." />

The ship couldn't take off with the colonists when Dylan experienced an unexpected sense of sympathy for his people and realized their shared bond in the face of great trouble because it was already overloaded. The ship had a maximum capacity of 10 passengers, but there were 60 colonists who needed to be evacuated. This means that even if all the colonists could fit into Dylan's ship, it still wouldn't be enough to accommodate everyone.&#10;2. The cause of the ship's failure to lift off was a sharp burning smell that occurred when the ship tried to take off with the colonists. Although the text does not explicitly state the reason for this malfunction, it can be inferred that it was due to the overloading of the ship beyond its weight capacity or safe operational limits. This would have put undue strain on the engines and other critical systems, making it impossible for the ship to lift off from the ground.">

The story suggests that an intelligent being, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, dug up and cut the wire to prevent the explosion and protect the camp from destruction. This is inferred from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;&#10;2. The colonists initially speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules. However, this explanation becomes less likely when considering the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, it is reasonable to infer that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction, given their prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.">

The colonies need someone with knowledge on how to handle tense situations, like defusing a bomb and clearing out colonies, tasks that require military expertise.&#10;3. Dylan's new role as a captain might also be a result of him being one of the few available people with a military background, now that the army is small, weak, and without respect after 500 years of peace and anti-war conditioning.

This is inferred from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;&#10;2. The colonists initially speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules. However, this explanation becomes less likely when considering the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, it is reasonable to infer that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction, given their prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.">

This is evidenced when Rossel tries to contact &quot;Three&quot; but hears no static or interference - the radio just doesn't work anymore.&#10;2.

The heart-wrenching reason behind Dylan's grief is the realization that his only friend, Bossio, has died while trying to help a group of people who had previously mistreated him. This loss is compounded by the fact that Dylan had considered Bossio as his sole companion in the vast and indifferent universe, making his death even more difficult to accept.&#10;2. The vow Dylan makes is in response to the grief he feels for Bossio's death and a sense of responsibility towards the people who are now looking up to him for help. Despite their past mistreatment of Bossio, these people have begun to view Dylan as their hope for survival, leading him to swear that he will stay behind and risk his life to save one of them.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's grief and vow stem from the tragic loss of his only friend, Bossio, who died while trying to help a group of people who had previously mistreated him. The realization that someone needs to stay behind to save an unknown person's life further intensifies his emotional response, ultimately leading him to make a selfless vow to protect a stranger despite the dangers he will face.">

The suspicious and dismissive attitude of the people towards the soldier (Captain Dylan) standing in the freezing wind is due to their deep-seated prejudice against soldiers, as they have been taught to hate war and consequently despise soldiers. They assume that Dylan is drunk, further highlighting their negative perception of soldiers.&#10;2. The significance of Captain Dylan's appearance and message for Bob Rossel lies in the fact that Dylan brings important information from Fleet Headquarters, which is likely crucial for the situation at the military base. This is evident by the thick, official-looking appearance of the envelope containing the message. The urgency of the situation is further emphasized when a young man arrives in the airlock of the hovering ship and tosses down a bottle, while Dylan remains unconcerned. Dylan's calm demeanor and professionalism contrast sharply with the recklessness of the young man, adding tension to the scene.">

Rush should instruct the sentries to check in with each other every five minutes. This will help ensure that they remain alert and aware of their surroundings, as well as enable them to quickly respond to any suspicious activity or threats.

Dylan is planning to seek assistance from the colony on Planet Three, as he mentions calling Bossio to ask about available space. He also intends to contact any fleet ships within radio distance, although he knows that the fleet is currently spread thin. By exploring these options, Dylan and the colonists hope to find a way to transport all sixty people to their intended colony.&#10;2. Additionally, Dylan has taken it upon himself to ensure the safety of the group by checking the bomb, demonstrating his commitment to their well-being despite the challenges they face. This proactive step, along with his efforts to unite and support the pioneers, will help build trust and foster a sense of solidarity as they work together to overcome their situation.">

The colonists' radio communications were disabled by an alien force using a device that sent out powerful electromagnetic pulses, frying their electronic devices and rendering them inoperable. This is evidenced when Rossel tries to contact &quot;Three&quot; but hears no static or interference - the radio just doesn't work anymore.&#10;2. As for why Rossel is unable to reach &quot;Three&quot; through the radio, it's because the alien force not only disabled their communications at this location but also likely took control of any outgoing signals, preventing them from sending a distress call. The text suggests that they have some level of understanding about human technology and communication systems. Additionally, after disabling the colonists' ship, the aliens probably left without leaving any functional communication equipment behind.">

Based on Dylan's directions, Rush should post the sentries in a ring around the perimeter of the site, on rises within calling distance of each other. This will allow them to have clear visibility and provide overlapping fields of view, which will increase their ability to detect any potential threats.&#10;2. Rush should instruct the sentries to check in with each other every five minutes. This will help ensure that they remain alert and aware of their surroundings, as well as enable them to quickly respond to any suspicious activity or threats. Additionally, it will allow them to coordinate their responses and provide backup if necessary.&#10;3. Rush should also inform the sentries of the need to be on the lookout for any animals or creatures that may pose a threat, such as the viggle, which can be as large as a dog. This will help ensure that they are prepared for any potential encounters and can take appropriate action if necessary.&#10;4. Finally, Rush should stress the importance of remaining calm and focused, even in the face of potential danger. Dylan's demeanor throughout the story demonstrates the value of maintaining a professional and level-headed approach, even when under pressure or in tense situations.

The significance of the viggle in relation to the characters' decision to post sentries is that it serves as a reminder of the potential dangers present in the environment beyond the military base. While the colonists have not yet encountered any hostile alien life, they are aware that there are potentially dangerous animals on the planet. By posting sentries, the colonists are taking precautions to ensure their safety and protect themselves from any potential threats, whether they be animal or alien in nature.">

The heart-wrenching reason behind Dylan's grief is the realization that his only friend, Bossio, has died while trying to help a group of people who had previously mistreated him. This loss is compounded by the fact that Dylan had considered Bossio as his sole companion in the vast and indifferent universe, making his death even more difficult to accept.&#10;2. The vow Dylan makes is in response to the grief he feels for Bossio's death and a sense of responsibility towards the people who are now looking up to him for help. Despite their past mistreatment of Bossio, these people have begun to view Dylan as their hope for survival, leading him to swear that he will stay behind and risk his life to save one of them.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's grief and vow stem from the tragic loss of his only friend, Bossio, who died while trying to help a group of people who had previously mistreated him.

This means that they do not have the resources or capability to provide assistance to the people who need it.&#10;2.

Based on Dylan's directions, Rush should post the sentries in a ring around the perimeter of the site, on rises within calling distance of each other. This will allow them to have clear visibility and provide overlapping fields of view, which will increase their ability to detect any potential threats.&#10;2. Rush should instruct the sentries to check in with each other every five minutes. This will help ensure that they remain alert and aware of their surroundings, as well as enable them to quickly respond to any suspicious activity or threats. Additionally, it will allow them to coordinate their responses and provide backup if necessary.&#10;3. Rush should also inform the sentries of the need to be on the lookout for any animals or creatures that may pose a threat, such as the viggle, which can be as large as a dog. This will help ensure that they are prepared for any potential encounters and can take appropriate action if necessary.&#10;4. Finally, Rush should stress the importance of remaining calm and focused, even in the face of potential danger. Dylan's demeanor throughout the story demonstrates the value of maintaining a professional and level-headed approach, even when under pressure or in tense situations. By following these instructions, Rush can help ensure that his sentries are well-prepared to handle any threats or challenges that may arise during their watch.">

The ship couldn't take off with the colonists when Dylan experienced an unexpected sense of sympathy for his people and realized their shared bond in the face of great trouble because it was already overloaded. The ship had a maximum capacity of 10 passengers, but there were 60 colonists who needed to be evacuated. This means that even if all the colonists could fit into Dylan's ship, it still wouldn't be enough to accommodate everyone.&#10;2. The cause of the ship's failure to lift off was a sharp burning smell that occurred when the ship tried to take off with the colonists. Although the text does not explicitly state the reason for this malfunction, it can be inferred that it was due to the overloading of the ship beyond its weight capacity or safe operational limits. This would have put undue strain on the engines and other critical systems, making it impossible for the ship to lift off from the ground.">

The story suggests that an intelligent being, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, dug up and cut the wire to prevent the explosion and protect the camp from destruction. This is inferred from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;&#10;2. The colonists initially speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules. However, this explanation becomes less likely when considering the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, it is reasonable to infer that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction, given their prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.">

The colonists' radio communications were disabled by an alien force using a device that sent out powerful electromagnetic pulses, frying their electronic devices and rendering them inoperable. This is evidenced when Rossel tries to contact &quot;Three&quot; but hears no static or interference - the radio just doesn't work anymore.&#10;2. As for why Rossel is unable to reach &quot;Three&quot; through the radio, it's because the alien force not only disabled their communications at this location but also likely took control of any outgoing signals, preventing them from sending a distress call. The text suggests that they have some level of understanding about human technology and communication systems. Additionally, after disabling the colonists' ship, the aliens probably left without leaving any functional communication equipment behind.">

The story suggests that an intelligent being, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, dug up and cut the wire to prevent the explosion and protect the camp from destruction. This is inferred from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;&#10;2. The colonists initially speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules. However, this explanation becomes less likely when considering the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, it is reasonable to infer that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction, given their prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.">

In the face of imminent danger from the aliens and the growing resentment among the colonists, Dylan and the pioneers must work together to ensure their survival.

Dylan, as a soldier and an outcast, might have to take charge of the situation due to his military background and experience. He should use his skills to guide the pioneers in making strategic decisions and maintaining order within the group. This includes managing conflicts, addressing concerns, and ensuring that everyone is prepared for any possible threat.&#10;3. Additionally, Dylan must find a way to regain the trust and support of the colonists despite their growing resentment. He can do this by being transparent about the situation, sharing vital information, and making it clear that he is committed to their safety and well-being. By demonstrating leadership and empathy, Dylan can help unite the pioneers and strengthen their resolve in facing the challenges ahead.">

Dylan's detached attitude towards losing the core of himself can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military bars or jails.

This mindset is reflected in his actions and reactions throughout the story, including when the wire comes loose in his hands and he temporarily abandons his habit of reaching for a bottle of alcohol.&#10;2. When the wire snaps, Dylan experiences shock but quickly recovers due to his expectation of such an event. The urgency of this incident indicates that something or someone doesn't want the camp destroyed. In this specific moment, the heightened state of awareness and focus required to understand why the wire was cut makes him less inclined to resort to his usual coping mechanism, which is reaching for a bottle of alcohol.&#10;3.

He also experiences irritation when Rossel leans on him, which contributes to his decision to let go of the bottle.&#10;2. The significance of the number of people Dylan's ship can take is related to the urgent situation at the military base. Rossel asks about the capacity of Dylan's ship because their own ship is overloaded, carrying 60 people while only having room for 40. He needs to evacuate some members of their group due to the overload, and Dylan's ship may be their only viable option for escape. The urgency in Rossel's question stems from this necessity to find a safe place for their group as soon as possible.">

Dylan's detachment from losing his identity can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military, leading him to become numb and indifferent to not being able to regain his lost self. This mindset is reflected in his actions throughout the story, such as temporarily abandoning his habit of reaching for a bottle of alcohol when the wire comes loose in his hands (story excerpt 1).&#10;   &#10;2. The unexpected discovery of a cut wire signifies that something urgent and real is happening, which requires Dylan's full attention and immediate action. In this situation, he cannot resort to his usual coping mechanism (reaching for alcohol) because the heightened state of awareness and focus required to understand why the wire was cut makes him less inclined to do so (story excerpt 2). The urgency of the situation demands that Dylan deal with the present danger instead of falling back on his automatic reliance on alcohol.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's detachment from losing his identity stems from past traumas and cynicism, while the absence of his usual reaction to discovering a cut wire indicates a heightened sense of urgency and focus on the present situation, which requires immediate action rather than escaping through alcohol.">

    <edge source="1. The Scandinavian legend about the Warrior in the northland cave serves as a metaphor for the military and its role in society. In times of peace, people tend to forget or dismiss the importance of soldiers and their duties. However, when faced with danger or a crisis, people turn to the military for help and protection. The legend emphasizes the timeless need for soldiers and their role in ensuring the safety and security of society.&#10;2. The misty and cold morning with an approaching snowstorm could be symbolic of the impending crisis facing the military base. Just as the snowstorm arrives unexpectedly, the danger at the base emerges without warning. This weather description helps create a sense of tension and urgency in the story, foreshadowing the arrival of Captain Dylan and his important message from Fleet Headquarters.&#10;3. Together, the Scandinavian legend and the cold, snowy morning establish an ominous tone, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and the value of having a strong military presence, even during times of peace. When faced with adversity or danger, people often rely on soldiers to protect them, as depicted in both the legend and the story's events." target="SOLDIER BOY&#10; &#10; &#10; By MICHAEL SHAARA&#10; &#10; Illustrated by EMSH&#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction July 1953.

This is inferred from the precise and calculated actions required for this task, as well as the fact that the &quot;something&quot; had prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack.&#10;&#10;2. The colonists initially speculate that one of their own people might have cut the wire due to disliking the idea of sitting on a live bomb as per government rules. However, this explanation becomes less likely when considering the subsequent cutting of the detonating wire at another colony, which was done newly and just before an alien attack.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, it is reasonable to infer that an intelligent extraterrestrial entity dug up and cut the wire to protect the camp from destruction, given their prior knowledge about the bomb and the alien attack." target="1.

The story implies that Dylan had a military background before becoming an outcast and spending thirty years &quot;bumming around&quot; and drinking. However, the specific reason for his transformation from a drunkard to a responsible captain is not detailed in the provided text. It could be due to a life-changing event or personal crisis that led him to reevaluate his choices and take up responsibility.&#10;2. Dylan's military skills and experience are recognized by whoever calls him up to serve as a captain, which highlights the urgency of the situation. The colonies need someone with knowledge on how to handle tense situations, like defusing a bomb and clearing out colonies, tasks that require military expertise.&#10;3. Dylan's new role as a captain might also be a result of him being one of the few available people with a military background, now that the army is small, weak, and without respect after 500 years of peace and anti-war conditioning. The army ships filled with drinkers, gamblers, and veterans are the only defense Earth has at the moment, and Dylan is one of those veterans.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's past military background and the urgent need for someone experienced in military strategies led to him being called up as a captain after thirty years of bumming around and playing the town drunk. The specific reason for his transformation isn't mentioned in the provided story.">

The heart-wrenching reason behind Dylan's grief is the realization that his only friend, Bossio, has died while trying to help a group of people on Planet Three. These people had previously mistreated Bossio, but now they look up to Dylan as their hope for survival. Dylan grapples with Bossio's death, as Bossio was his only friend and companion in the vast universe, making his loss even more difficult to accept.&#10;2. The determination to stay behind and risk his life for a stranger stems from Dylan's grief and a sense of responsibility towards the people who are now looking up to him for help. Despite their past mistreatment of Bossio, these people have begun to view Dylan as their hope for survival, leading him to swear that he will stay behind and save one of them. This decision is further solidified by the harsh environment and the fact that he himself will have to stay behind and face danger for their sake.">

Furthermore, Dylan might be pondering his detachment from the situation as a result of trauma and cynicism experienced during his military service. He may need to confront these feelings and find ways to reconnect with his fellow colonists in order to ensure their collective safety and well-being.&#10;4. Lastly, Dylan could be reflecting on his personal journey and the concept of identity, as suggested by his calm demeanor when interacting with Rossel. He might be contemplating the idea that regaining his lost self may not be possible or significant in light of their current predicament, choosing instead to focus on the shared bond he has with the colonists in facing great trouble together.">

Dylan's detachment from losing his identity can be attributed to the trauma and cynicism he experienced during his time in the military, leading him to become numb and indifferent to not being able to regain his lost self. This mindset is reflected in his actions throughout the story, such as temporarily abandoning his habit of reaching for a bottle of alcohol when the wire comes loose in his hands (story excerpt 1).&#10;   &#10;2. The unexpected discovery of a cut wire signifies that something urgent and real is happening, which requires Dylan's full attention and immediate action. In this situation, he cannot resort to his usual coping mechanism (reaching for alcohol) because the heightened state of awareness and focus required to understand why the wire was cut makes him less inclined to do so (story excerpt 2). The urgency of the situation demands that Dylan deal with the present danger instead of falling back on his automatic reliance on alcohol.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dylan's detachment from losing his identity stems from past traumas and cynicism, while the absence of his usual reaction to discovering a cut wire indicates a heightened sense of urgency and focus on the present situation, which requires immediate action rather than escaping through alcohol.">

    <node id="The person reminiscing about Kennicott is Carol, his wife. What has changed in their relationship, causing her to question if the romantic days of their courtship are gone completely, is that Kennicott no longer makes efforts to please her or touch her as he did before. She feels that he is more concerned with his business and reading story-books than with their relationship. Additionally, she observes that his hands, which used to be clean and well-kept, are now often dirty and untidy, which further emphasizes the distance that has grown between them. These changes have led Carol to question if the romantic connection they once shared has faded away completely." />
    <node id=". Kennicott so much,&#10;but MY man, heavens, now there's a rare old bird! Reading story-books&#10;when he ought to be tending to business! 'Marcus Westlake,' I say to&#10;him, 'you're a romantic old fool.' And does he get angry? He does not!&#10;He chuckles and says, 'Yes, my beloved, folks do say that married&#10;people grow to resemble each other!' Drat him!&quot; Mrs. Westlake laughed&#10;comfortably.&#10;&#10;After such a disclosure what could Carol do but return the courtesy by&#10;remarking that as for Kennicott, he wasn't romantic enough--the darling.&#10;Before she left she had babbled to Mrs. Westlake her dislike for Aunt&#10;Bessie, the fact that Kennicott's income was now more than five thousand&#10;a year, her view of the reason why Vida had married Raymie (which&#10;included some thoroughly insincere praise of Raymie's &quot;kind heart&quot;), her&#10;opinion of the library-board, just what Kennicott had said about Mrs.&#10;Carthal's diabetes, and what Kennicott thought of the several surgeons&#10;in the Cities.&#10;&#10;She went" />
    <node id=". That they were invariably clean, that his were the scoured&#10;fingers of the surgeon, made his stubborn untidiness the more jarring.&#10;They were wise hands, kind hands, but they were not the hands of love.&#10;&#10;She remembered him in the days of courtship. He had tried to please her,&#10;then, had touched her by sheepishly wearing a colored band on his straw&#10;hat. Was it possible that those days of fumbling for each other were&#10;gone so completely? He had read books, to impress her; had said (she&#10;recalled it ironically) that she was to point out his every fault; had&#10;insisted once, as they sat in the secret place beneath the walls of Fort&#10;Snelling----&#10;&#10;She shut the door on her thoughts. That was sacred ground. But it WAS a&#10;shame that----&#10;&#10;She nervously pushed away her cake and stewed apricots.&#10;&#10;After supper, when they had been driven in from the porch by mosquitos,&#10;when Kennicott had for the two-hundredth time in five years commented,&#10;&quot;We must have a new screen on the porch--lets all the bugs in,&quot; they sat&#10;reading, and she" />
    <node id=" She was certain that they were discussing her, and foully&#10;forgiving her. She lay awake till she heard the distant creak of a bed&#10;which indicated that Kennicott had retired. Then she felt safe.&#10;&#10;It was Kennicott who brought up the matter of the Smails at breakfast.&#10;With no visible connection he said, &quot;Uncle Whit is kind of clumsy, but&#10;just the same, he's a pretty wise old coot. He's certainly making good&#10;with the store.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol smiled, and Kennicott was pleased that she had come to her senses.&#10;&quot;As Whit says, after all the first thing is to have the inside of a&#10;house right, and darn the people on the outside looking in!&quot;&#10;&#10;It seemed settled that the house was to be a sound example of the Sam&#10;Clark school.&#10;&#10;Kennicott made much of erecting it entirely for her and the baby. He&#10;spoke of closets for her frocks, and &quot;a comfy sewing-room.&quot; But when&#10;he drew on a leaf from an old account-book (he was a paper-saver and a&#10;string-picker) the plans for the garage, he gave" />

She wanted&#10;to confess not only her hatred for the Aunt Bessies but her covert&#10;irritation toward those she best loved: her alienation from Kennicott,&#10;her disappointment in Guy Pollock, her uneasiness in the presence of&#10;Vida. She had enough self-control to confine herself to, &quot;Yes. Men! The&#10;dear blundering souls, we do have to get off and laugh at them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course we do.

He was curiously like his own brown-painted motor car, with&#10;eye-glasses for windshield. &quot;Want you to meet my wife, doctor--Carrie,&#10;make you 'quainted with Dr. Calibree,&quot; said Kennicott. Calibree bowed&#10;quietly and shook her hand, but before he had finished shaking it he was&#10;concentrating upon Kennicott with, &quot;Nice to see you, doctor.

    <node id="The speaker is Nat Hicks, tailor and &quot;roue&quot; (a man who leads an immoral or dissolute life), who is inviting the protagonist, Dr. Kennicott, to join him and his friends for an evening of drinking and likely partying. The people named include Mrs. Swiftwaite, a dressmaker with blonde hair, and a &quot;fat wren&quot; who works at the Bon Ton store. Nat also mentions that there will be another woman joining them, a friend of Mrs. Swiftwaite's from Winona.

Between waves of his hand as he drove off mosquitos, Nat&#10;whispered, &quot;Say, doc, you don't feel like imagining you're a bacheldore&#10;again, and coming out for a Time tonight, do you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As how?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know this new dressmaker, Mrs. Swiftwaite?--swell dame with&#10;blondine hair?

Since there were no sweating passengers crammed&#10;in beside her, she reveled in the train's slowness. She was part of&#10;these lakes and tawny wheat-fields. She liked the smell of hot earth and&#10;clean grease; and the leisurely chug-a-chug, chug-a-chug of the trucks&#10;was a song of contentment in the sun.&#10;&#10;She pretended that she was going to the Rockies.

He was no more brusquely familiar than a dozen&#10;other clerks of the town, but her nerves were heat-scorched.&#10;&#10;When she asked for codfish, for supper, he grunted, &quot;What d'you want&#10;that darned old dry stuff for?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I like it!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Punk!

Previously, she saw nature as merely a colorful backdrop, but now, thanks to Hugh's influence, she becomes attentive to the &quot;comedies&quot; of birds and regains her pleasure in observing their behaviors. The hitching-post becomes a special spot for Carol and Hugh, where they can examine and appreciate their surroundings together.&#10;2. The Bjornstams' house represents a sanctuary for Carol and Hugh, a place where they can escape the conventionality of Gopher Prairie society. Kennicott disapproves of the family, highlighting the social divide between them and Carol. However, both Carol and Hugh form deep connections with Miles and Bea Bjornstam.

If Hugh batted&#10;him--and Hugh did bat him--Olaf was unafraid but shocked. In magnificent&#10;solitude he marched toward the house, while Hugh bewailed his sin and&#10;the overclouding of august favor.&#10;&#10;The two friends played with an imperial chariot which Miles had made out&#10;of a starch-box and four red spools; together they stuck switches into&#10;a mouse-hole, with vast satisfaction though entirely without known&#10;results.&#10;&#10;Bea, the chubby and humming Bea, impartially gave cookies and scoldings&#10;to both children, and if Carol refused a cup of coffee and a wafer of&#10;buttered knackebrod, she was desolated.&#10;&#10;Miles had done well with his dairy. He had six cows, two hundred&#10;chickens, a cream separator, a Ford truck. In the spring he had built a&#10;two-room addition to his shack. That illustrious building was to Hugh a&#10;carnival.

    <node id="One of the most challenging issues in the prairie town is the lack of servants, which has been exacerbated by farmers' daughters rebelling against village dullness and seeking opportunities in city kitchens or shops.

    <node id="The narrator, Carol, has had a change in her perspective toward her husband, Kennicott, after observing his appearance and table manners. She realizes that she hasn't really looked at him closely for about a year, and when she does, she is slightly disgusted by his habit of licking his knife after eating and his general untidiness. This observation makes her question if the romantic connection they once shared has faded away completely. The state of his appearance and table manners highlights the distance that has grown between them due to his increasing focus on business and neglect of their relationship, making Carol reconsider the state of her marriage." />

    <node id="Carrie decides to change the spare room and turn it into her personal space as a way of asserting her independence and creating a separate identity from her husband. By doing so, she is able to create a space that reflects her own interests and desires, rather than solely focusing on her role as a wife and mother. This change in the spare room also serves as a physical manifestation of Carrie's growing need for privacy and autonomy within her marriage.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's suspicion that Carrie intends to maintain her seclusion is likely due to the fact that she has created a personal space that is separate from their shared marital bed. This change may make him feel excluded or uncertain about the state of their relationship, leading him to wonder if Carrie is distancing herself from him emotionally as well as physically. Additionally, the fact that Carrie has stored away the double bed and replaced it with a cot may further reinforce Kennicott's suspicions, as this change could be seen as a symbolic rejection of their marital relationship.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carrie's decision to change the spare room reflects her desire for greater independence and autonomy within her marriage, while also highlighting the complex dynamics of their relationship." />

    <node id="Yes, based on the symptoms described and Kennicott's diagnosis, it is likely that Bea and Olaf are suffering from typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can cause high fever, abdominal pain, and delirium, among other symptoms. It is typically spread through contaminated food or water, which may be the case with Bea and Olaf if they have been consuming water from a potentially contaminated source.&#10;&#10;Given the severity of their illness, it is possible that a nurse may be required to help care for them. Carol is currently taking on this role, but she will need assistance in order to provide adequate care around the clock.

    <node id="Based on the information provided, it's possible that the stomach issues being experienced by Bea and Olaf, the dogs, could be related to a change in their water source. Miles mentions that they had been getting their water from Oscar Eklund's place but switched to using their own well after an argument with Eklund. It is suggested that the water from the new well may be contaminated and causing the dogs' illness.&#10;&#10;Typhoid fever, which is a bacterial infection causing symptoms such as high fever and abdominal pain, is mentioned as a possible diagnosis for Bea and Olaf based on their symptoms and Dr. Kennicott's diagnosis. Typhoid fever is typically spread through contaminated food or water, making it a likely cause for the dogs' illness if they have been consuming water from a potentially contaminated source.&#10;&#10;To confirm this theory and ensure proper treatment, it would be necessary to conduct further testing on the water source and the dogs themselves." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is clear that Aunt Bessie and Uncle Whittier recommend Carol and Kennicott have a practical, functional home rather than one with architectural details or &quot;doodads.&quot; They value features such as closets, a good furnace, and a convenient place to hang out washing over things like towers or bay windows. They believe that the interior of the house is more important than its appearance to outsiders. Therefore, it is likely that they would recommend a functional, square house with modern conveniences rather than an elaborate or decorative one." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Carol's distrust of Will Kennicott seems to stem from her observation of changes in his appearance and behavior, as well as her knowledge of his thoughts. She has noticed that he has become more untidy, including licking his knife after eating and having dirty hands, which she takes as a sign of neglect for their relationship due to his increasing focus on business. Additionally, Carol knows that Kennicott has been thinking about other women, such as when he mentioned that Mrs. Carthal's dress was &quot;tight across the hips&quot; or when he commented on another woman's appearance. While there is no explicit indication of infidelity, these thoughts make Carol question the state of her marriage and contribute to her distrust of Kennicott." />
    <node id="The ultimate decision for Carol and Kennicott's summer plans is being driven by a combination of Carol's desire for adventure and new experiences, Kennicott's limited availability due to his work commitments, and the tension resulting from Carol's growing discontent with their relationship. Although Kennicott proposes a local convention as a compromise, it does not fulfill Carol's longing for travel and exploration, causing her to question if she wants to spend another summer in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's desire for adventure and change is evident throughout the narrative, and her dissatisfaction with their current situation has been growing due to Kennicott's neglect of their relationship and increasing focus on his business. The prospect of a local convention does not excite her because it represents more of the same monotonous life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's limited availability for travel is another factor influencing their summer plans. As a doctor, he has responsibilities that prevent him from taking extended time off to go on a long trip with Carol. This limitation further contributes to the tension between them and makes it challenging for Carol to reconcile her desire for adventure with Kennicott's inability to accompany her.&#10;&#10;The underlying issue, however, is the growing tension in their relationship due to Carol's discontent and Kennicott's preoccupation with his work. While a trip together might help alleviate some of this tension, the local convention does not offer the same opportunity for reconnection as a more meaningful journey would.&#10;&#10;In summary, the decision for Carol and Kennicott's summer plans is being driven by a combination of Carol's desire for adventure, Kennicott's limited availability due to work commitments, and the tension resulting from Carol's growing discontent with their relationship. The local convention proposal does not address these underlying issues, making it challenging for them to find common ground in their summer plans." />

However, she does not have any definite signs of it and is probably seeking reassurance from Will." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, there are a few reasons why Kennicott decides to focus solely on building the interior of their new house and put more attention on details like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage rather than a sewing-room.&#10;&#10;Firstly, as mentioned earlier, Kennicott's aunt and uncle, the Smails, have recommended that he and Carol prioritize functionality and practicality in their new home over architectural details or decorative features. The Smails believe that the interior of the house is more important than its appearance to outsiders, and this philosophy seems to influence Kennicott's thinking as he plans the construction of their new home.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol has been expressing some reservations about moving into the new house, and Kennicott may sense her reluctance. By focusing on practical features like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage, he may be trying to reassure Carol that the new house will meet their needs and make their lives more convenient.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Kennicott himself is a practical person who values efficiency and functionality. He is a &quot;paper-saver and string-picker,&quot; suggesting that he is careful with resources and mindful of practical considerations. By focusing on details like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage, he is prioritizing features that will make their lives easier and more convenient in the long run.&#10;&#10;Overall, Kennicott's decision to focus solely on building the interior of their new house and pay more attention to practical features like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage reflects his practical nature, his desire to please his wife, and his willingness to follow the advice of his pragmatic aunt and uncle." />

But the new place would be smooth, standardized, fixed. It was&#10;probable, now that Kennicott was past forty, and settled, that this&#10;would be the last venture he would ever make in building. So long as she&#10;stayed in this ark, she would always have a possibility of change, but&#10;once she was in the new house, there she would sit for all the rest of&#10;her life--there she would die. Desperately she wanted to put it off,&#10;against the chance of miracles.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis's novel &quot;Main Street,&quot; begins to prefer the company of the Bjornstams, a family consisting of a &quot;Swede hired girl&quot; and her relatives, over her former friends and acquaintances such as the Jolly Seventeen, Guy Pollock, and Vida, due to several reasons.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Carol finds in the Bjornstams the camaraderie, understanding, and cynicism that she feels is missing from her relationships with her other friends. The Jolly Seventeen, a group of young matrons, make her nervous with their loud and repetitive jests. She has also grown disillusioned with the puerile methods persisting in housework and questions the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home, which she had previously regarded as the basis of all decent life.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Carol feels that her former friends, like Guy Pollock and Vida, do not provide the intellectual stimulation she seeks. She begins to develop doubts about the conventional views and expectations of women in society, including the role of a wife and mother, and finds it difficult to relate to her old acquaintances who seem content with their traditional roles.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Carol's relationship with her husband, Dr. Will Kennicott, has become distant and less romantic than before. She feels that he is more concerned with his business and reading story-books than with their relationship, and this further alienates her from the social circles she used to move in.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the Bjornstams represent a simpler way of life, free from societal expectations and conventions. They provide Carol with a sense of belonging and acceptance that she fails to find in her former friends, making them a more preferable company for her at this stage in her life." />
    <node id=" and Olaf Bjornstam.&#10;&#10;Kennicott steadily disapproved of the Bjornstams. He protested, &quot;What&#10;do you want to talk to that crank for?&quot; He hinted that a former &quot;Swede&#10;hired girl&quot; was low company for the son of Dr. Will Kennicott. She did&#10;not explain. She did not quite understand it herself; did not know that&#10;in the Bjornstams she found her friends, her club, her sympathy and her&#10;ration of blessed cynicism. For a time the gossip of Juanita Haydock and&#10;the Jolly Seventeen had been a refuge from the droning of Aunt Bessie,&#10;but the relief had not continued. The young matrons made her nervous.&#10;They talked so loud, always so loud. They filled a room with&#10;clashing cackle; their jests and gags they repeated nine times over.&#10;Unconsciously, she had discarded the Jolly Seventeen, Guy Pollock, Vida,&#10;and every one save Mrs. Dr. Westlake and the friends whom she did not&#10;clearly know as friends--the Bjornstams.&#10;&#10;To Hugh, the Red Swede was the most heroic and powerful" />

Carol was deft, and won shy praise from Kennicott, but as her&#10;shoulder blades began to sting, she wondered how many millions of women&#10;had lied to themselves during the death-rimmed years through which they&#10;had pretended to enjoy the puerile methods persisting in housework.&#10;&#10;She doubted the convenience and, as a natural sequent, the sanctity of&#10;the monogamous and separate home which she had regarded as the basis of&#10;all decent life.&#10;&#10;She considered her doubts vicious. She refused to remember how many of&#10;the women of the Jolly Seventeen nagged their husbands and were nagged&#10;by them.&#10;&#10;She energetically did not whine to Kennicott. But her eyes ached; she&#10;was not the girl in breeches and a flannel shirt who had cooked over a&#10;camp-fire in the Colorado mountains five" />
    <node id="Mrs. Westlake implies that it's not uncommon for married women to want their own sleeping quarters by admitting that she has her own &quot;royal apartments&quot; separate from her husband, Dr. Westlake. She suggests that having separate sleeping quarters allows her and the doctor to have some independence and space from each other. Carol's reaction to this idea is one of surprise and relief, as evidenced by her question: &quot;Then you wouldn't regard me as a complete hussy if I wanted to be by myself now and then?&quot; This suggests that Carol has been considering the idea of having her own sleeping quarters but was unsure if it would be perceived as scandalous or inappropriate. Mrs. Westlake's response indicates that it is a common and accepted practice, which encourages Carol to consider it further." />

    <node id="In the car ride and dinner scene, Carol and Kennicott have a moment of closeness and connection amidst their growing distance. Carol suddenly takes notice of her husband's appearance and table manners, which she finds slightly disgusting, but she quickly moves past it and expresses her admiration for him. She compliments him on being calm and composed, contrasting his demeanor with their noisy son Hugh.&#10;&#10;Carol playfully invites Kennicott to come over to their house in the evening, implying that they could spend some alone time together. She emphasizes that their clerk Dave will not be around, indicating that she wants to avoid any interruptions or distractions. She also reassures Kennicott that spending time together would not be wrong, suggesting that she is aware of the potential impropriety of such a meeting.&#10;&#10;Kennicott seems hesitant at first, expressing some concern about whether it would be appropriate to spend time alone with his wife while their clerk is away. However, Carol's persistence and persuasion seem to win him over, and he eventually agrees to come over. This interaction suggests that despite their marital issues, Carol and Kennicott still have a strong bond and care for each other, and they are willing to make an effort to reconnect." />

    <node id="The character Carol in this narrative does not have a specific daily routine mentioned as she walks through the town. However, the narrator describes her observations and reactions during a particular walk. Carol notices the changes in her husband Kennicott's appearance and table manners, which makes her question their relationship. She also observes the shortage of servants in the town and the challenges it poses for families like hers. Furthermore, she becomes aware of secret or disreputable activities engaged in by some men when they go to the cities, although no specific details are provided. During this walk, Carol is comforted by the support shown by Vida Sherwin, Maud Dyer, and Mrs. Zitterel when they visit her to help with her sick wife Bea. Lastly, she reacts negatively to an invitation from Nat Hicks for her husband Kennicott to join him and his friends for an evening of drinking and partying." />
    <node id="The speaker, Dr. Kennicott, may want to be seen professionally by Mr. Dave Dyer because of their shared connection through Maud Dyer, who is supposedly sick and whom Kennicott had previously promised to visit. However, Kennicott is now considering going back on his promise due to his suspicion that Maud may be exaggerating her health issues. By visiting Maud in a professional capacity as her doctor, Kennicott could avoid the potential drama or temptation of their past relationship while still fulfilling his responsibility as a healthcare provider.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's previous experience of having to work hard for what he wants is relevant to his current situation because it affects his decision-making process when it comes to visiting Maud. He describes himself as &quot;a poor fool&quot; who has been too willing to be led on by women in the past, and he regrets this about himself. This experience may make him more cautious and deliberate in his actions towards Maud, recognizing that he has a responsibility to be honest with her and not let her continue to believe that there could be something more between them.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Kennicott's previous experience of working hard for what he wants may also factor into his current relationship with his wife, Carrie. He values the stability and happiness of their current relationship over any potential drama or temptation from his past, suggesting that he has worked hard to build a strong marriage with Carrie and is unwilling to risk losing it. Overall, Kennicott's previous experiences shape his current actions and decisions, reflecting his desire to do the right thing and maintain healthy relationships with the women in his life." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, it is likely that Bea and Olaf Bjornstam are suffering from typhoid fever, a bacterial infection that can cause high fever, abdominal pain, and delirium. The symptoms they are experiencing, including stomach issues, are consistent with this diagnosis. It is possible that their illness was caused by contaminated water from a new well that Miles Bjornstam had dug after an argument with their previous water source's owner. To confirm this theory and ensure proper treatment, further testing on the water source and the Bjornstams would be necessary." />

The addition&#10;gave her a kitchen with a bedroom above. The original one-room shack was&#10;now a living-room, with the phonograph, a genuine leather-upholstered&#10;golden-oak rocker, and a picture of Governor John Johnson.&#10;&#10;In late July Carol went to the Bjornstams' desirous of a chance to&#10;express her opinion of Beavers and Calibrees and Joralemons. She found&#10;Olaf abed, restless from a slight fever, and Bea flushed and dizzy but&#10;trying to keep up her work. She lured Miles aside and worried:&#10;&#10;&quot;They don't look at all well.

Kennicott came&#10;in three times a day, unchangingly tender and hopeful in the sick-room,&#10;evenly polite to Miles.&#10;&#10;Carol understood how great was her love for her friends. It bore&#10;her through; it made her arm steady and tireless to bathe them.&#10;What exhausted her was the sight of Bea and Olaf turned into flaccid&#10;invalids, uncomfortably flushed after taking food, begging for the&#10;healing of sleep at night.&#10;&#10;During the second week Olaf's powerful legs were flabby. Spots of a&#10;viciously delicate pink came out on his chest and back. His cheeks sank.&#10;He looked frightened. His tongue was brown and revolting. His confident&#10;voice dwindled to a bewildered murmur, ceaseless and racking.&#10;&#10;Bea had stayed on her feet too long at the beginning.

    <node id="Yes, based on the symptoms described and Kennicott's diagnosis, it is likely that Bea and Olaf are suffering from typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can cause high fever, abdominal pain, and delirium, among other symptoms.&#10;&#10;Given the severity of their illness, hiring a nurse would be a good idea to ensure that they receive adequate care and attention. Carol has taken on the role of caring for them but she will need assistance in order to provide around-the-clock care. A trained nurse would have the necessary medical expertise to help Bea and Olaf make a full recovery. It is also worth noting that the town nurse is currently unavailable, which further highlights the need for additional medical support." />
    <node id="The narrator, Dr. Kennicott, thinks he is seen as the &quot;town badman&quot; despite his attempts to avoid controversy during a church visit because of his reputation and past actions with women. Specifically, when he accompanied his wife Bea to the Methodist Church, the other parishioners seemed to deliberately ignore him and did not engage with him, possibly due to their preconceived notions about him based on rumors or gossip in the town. This suggests that Kennicott's efforts to fit in and be accepted by the community have been unsuccessful, and he is still perceived as an outsider or troublemaker despite his best attempts to conform." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, there are rumors circulating in the town about a new dressmaker named Mrs. Swiftwaite, who is described as an &quot;awful peroxide blonde.&quot; The townsfolk gossip about &quot;the awfullest goings-on&quot; at her house, including boys and old men sneaking in there to drink alcohol and engage in other questionable activities. However, it's important to note that these are just rumors and have not been confirmed. Mrs. Swiftwaite is portrayed as a central figure in the social scene that Nat Hicks and his friends are part of, but the specific details of the allegations against her are not provided in the narrative." />
    <node id="The speaker, Dr. Kennicott, has mixed feelings about his wife Carrie's attempts to change him. On one hand, he appreciates her efforts to help him become a more cultured and sophisticated person. He recognizes that she comes from a different social background than him and that she wants him to fit in with her friends and associates. However, at times he feels frustrated by her constant nagging and seems to resent the implication that there is something wrong with him as he is.&#10;&#10;Regarding romantic relationships outside of his marriage, it is suggested that Dr. Kennicott may have been tempted in the past, given his history of leading women on and his reputation as a &quot;town badman.&quot; However, at this point in the narrative, he does not seem to be actively seeking out such relationships. In fact, he values the stability and happiness of his current marriage with Carrie over any potential drama or temptation from his past.&#10;&#10;When presented with the opportunity to visit Maud Dyer, a former flame who may be exaggerating her health issues in an attempt to manipulate him, Dr. Kennicott ultimately decides not to go. Instead, he chooses to spend a peaceful evening at home with Carrie and their son, suggesting that he prioritizes their relationship above any potential temptation or drama from his past.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Dr. Kennicott may have been tempted in the past, he seems committed to remaining faithful to his wife and maintaining a healthy marriage." />
    <node id="The speaker's dilemma is that he had previously promised to visit Maud Dyer, but now suspects that she may be exaggerating her health issues and trying to manipulate him into spending time with her. He feels guilty for having led Maud on in the past and leading her on, and doesn't want to hurt her feelings by going back on his promise. However, he also values the stability and happiness of his current relationship with his wife, Carrie, who he describes as the &quot;finest little woman in the world.&quot;&#10;&#10;In considering how to handle this situation, the speaker weighs his sense of responsibility towards Maud against his commitment to Carrie. He ultimately decides not to visit Maud, citing her manipulative behavior and his responsibility to be honest with her as factors in his decision. Instead, he plans to spend a peaceful evening at home with his wife and son, suggesting that he values the stability and happiness of his current relationship over any potential drama or temptation from his past.&#10;&#10;In making this decision, the speaker takes into account his feelings of responsibility towards Maud and his guilt for having led her on in the past.

Later, Miles thanks Carol for her help but is unable to pay her back. However, when the time comes for the funeral, Carol is in bed, collapsed, and does not attend.

Although Kennicott proposes a local convention as a compromise, it does not fulfill Carol's longing for travel and exploration, causing her to question if she wants to spend another summer in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's desire for adventure and change is evident throughout the narrative, and her dissatisfaction with their current situation has been growing due to Kennicott's neglect of their relationship and increasing focus on his business. The prospect of a local convention does not excite her because it represents more of the same monotonous life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's limited availability for travel is another factor influencing their summer plans. As a doctor, he has responsibilities that prevent him from taking extended time off to go on a long trip with Carol. This limitation further contributes to the tension between them and makes it challenging for Carol to reconcile her desire for adventure with Kennicott's inability to accompany her.&#10;&#10;The underlying issue, however, is the growing tension in their relationship due to Carol's discontent and Kennicott's preoccupation with his work. While a trip together might help alleviate some of this tension, the local convention does not offer the same opportunity for reconnection as a more meaningful journey would.&#10;&#10;In summary, the decision for Carol and Kennicott's summer plans is being driven by a combination of Carol's desire for adventure, Kennicott's limited availability due to work commitments, and the tension resulting from Carol's growing discontent with their relationship. The local convention proposal does not address these underlying issues, making it challenging for them to find common ground in their summer plans.">

Carol's reaction to this idea is one of surprise and relief, as evidenced by her question: &quot;Then you wouldn't regard me as a complete hussy if I wanted to be by myself now and then?&quot; This suggests that Carol has been considering the idea of having her own sleeping quarters but was unsure if it would be perceived as scandalous or inappropriate. Mrs. Westlake's response indicates that it is a common and accepted practice, which encourages Carol to consider it further.">

The Smails believe that the interior of the house is more important than its appearance to outsiders, and this philosophy seems to influence Kennicott's thinking as he plans the construction of their new home.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol has been expressing some reservations about moving into the new house, and Kennicott may sense her reluctance. By focusing on practical features like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage, he may be trying to reassure Carol that the new house will meet their needs and make their lives more convenient.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Kennicott himself is a practical person who values efficiency and functionality. He is a &quot;paper-saver and string-picker,&quot; suggesting that he is careful with resources and mindful of practical considerations. By focusing on details like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage, he is prioritizing features that will make their lives easier and more convenient in the long run.&#10;&#10;Overall, Kennicott's decision to focus solely on building the interior of their new house and pay more attention to practical features like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage reflects his practical nature, his desire to please his wife, and his willingness to follow the advice of his pragmatic aunt and uncle.">

The Jolly Seventeen, a group of young matrons, make her nervous with their loud and repetitive jests. She has also grown disillusioned with the puerile methods persisting in housework and questions the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home, which she had previously regarded as the basis of all decent life.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Carol feels that her former friends, like Guy Pollock and Vida, do not provide the intellectual stimulation she seeks. She begins to develop doubts about the conventional views and expectations of women in society, including the role of a wife and mother, and finds it difficult to relate to her old acquaintances who seem content with their traditional roles.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Carol's relationship with her husband, Dr. Will Kennicott, has become distant and less romantic than before. She feels that he is more concerned with his business and reading story-books than with their relationship, and this further alienates her from the social circles she used to move in.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the Bjornstams represent a simpler way of life, free from societal expectations and conventions.

He recognizes that he has a responsibility to be honest with her and not let her continue to believe that there could be something more between them.&#10;&#10;Maud's personality is also a factor in Kennicott's decision. He describes her as &quot;neurotic, religiocentric, faded,&quot; and notes that she has a tendency to be demanding and manipulative. These factors make it easier for Kennicott to justify his decision not to visit her.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Kennicott decides not to visit Maud and instead spends a peaceful evening at home with his wife and son.

Although Kennicott proposes a local convention as a compromise, it does not fulfill Carol's longing for travel and exploration, causing her to question if she wants to spend another summer in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's desire for adventure and change is evident throughout the narrative, and her dissatisfaction with their current situation has been growing due to Kennicott's neglect of their relationship and increasing focus on his business. The prospect of a local convention does not excite her because it represents more of the same monotonous life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's limited availability for travel is another factor influencing their summer plans. As a doctor, he has responsibilities that prevent him from taking extended time off to go on a long trip with Carol. This limitation further contributes to the tension between them and makes it challenging for Carol to reconcile her desire for adventure with Kennicott's inability to accompany her.&#10;&#10;The underlying issue, however, is the growing tension in their relationship due to Carol's discontent and Kennicott's preoccupation with his work. While a trip together might help alleviate some of this tension, the local convention does not offer the same opportunity for reconnection as a more meaningful journey would.&#10;&#10;In summary, the decision for Carol and Kennicott's summer plans is being driven by a combination of Carol's desire for adventure, Kennicott's limited availability due to work commitments, and the tension resulting from Carol's growing discontent with their relationship.

The state of his appearance and table manners highlights the distance that has grown between them due to his increasing focus on business and neglect of their relationship, making Carol reconsider the state of her marriage.">

He also recognizes that he has a responsibility to his wife, Carrie, who he describes as the &quot;finest little woman in the world.&quot; On the other hand, Kennicott feels guilty for having jollied Maud along in the past and leading her on, and he doesn't want to hurt her feelings by going back on his promise to visit her.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's internal conflict reveals that he is aware of the impact his actions have on the women in his life, and he wants to do the right thing even if it means sacrificing his own desires. He also recognizes that he has a tendency to be a &quot;poor fool&quot; when it comes to women, and he regrets this about himself. Ultimately, Kennicott decides not to visit Maud and instead spends a peaceful evening at home with his wife and son, which suggests that he values the stability and happiness of his current relationship over any potential drama or temptation from his past." target="Carrie decides to change the spare room and turn it into her personal space as a way of asserting her independence and creating a separate identity from her husband. By doing so, she is able to create a space that reflects her own interests and desires, rather than solely focusing on her role as a wife and mother. This change in the spare room also serves as a physical manifestation of Carrie's growing need for privacy and autonomy within her marriage.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's suspicion that Carrie intends to maintain her seclusion is likely due to the fact that she has created a personal space that is separate from their shared marital bed. This change may make him feel excluded or uncertain about the state of their relationship, leading him to wonder if Carrie is distancing herself from him emotionally as well as physically. Additionally, the fact that Carrie has stored away the double bed and replaced it with a cot may further reinforce Kennicott's suspicions, as this change could be seen as a symbolic rejection of their marital relationship.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carrie's decision to change the spare room reflects her desire for greater independence and autonomy within her marriage, while also highlighting the complex dynamics of their relationship.">

Although Kennicott proposes a local convention as a compromise, it does not fulfill Carol's longing for travel and exploration, causing her to question if she wants to spend another summer in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's desire for adventure and change is evident throughout the narrative, and her dissatisfaction with their current situation has been growing due to Kennicott's neglect of their relationship and increasing focus on his business. The prospect of a local convention does not excite her because it represents more of the same monotonous life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's limited availability for travel is another factor influencing their summer plans. As a doctor, he has responsibilities that prevent him from taking extended time off to go on a long trip with Carol. This limitation further contributes to the tension between them and makes it challenging for Carol to reconcile her desire for adventure with Kennicott's inability to accompany her.&#10;&#10;The underlying issue, however, is the growing tension in their relationship due to Carol's discontent and Kennicott's preoccupation with his work. While a trip together might help alleviate some of this tension, the local convention does not offer the same opportunity for reconnection as a more meaningful journey would.&#10;&#10;In summary, the decision for Carol and Kennicott's summer plans is being driven by a combination of Carol's desire for adventure, Kennicott's limited availability due to work commitments, and the tension resulting from Carol's growing discontent with their relationship. The local convention proposal does not address these underlying issues, making it challenging for them to find common ground in their summer plans.">

This change in the spare room also serves as a physical manifestation of Carrie's growing need for privacy and autonomy within her marriage.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's suspicion that Carrie intends to maintain her seclusion is likely due to the fact that she has created a personal space that is separate from their shared marital bed.

Although Kennicott proposes a local convention as a compromise, it does not fulfill Carol's longing for travel and exploration, causing her to question if she wants to spend another summer in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's desire for adventure and change is evident throughout the narrative, and her dissatisfaction with their current situation has been growing due to Kennicott's neglect of their relationship and increasing focus on his business. The prospect of a local convention does not excite her because it represents more of the same monotonous life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's limited availability for travel is another factor influencing their summer plans. As a doctor, he has responsibilities that prevent him from taking extended time off to go on a long trip with Carol. This limitation further contributes to the tension between them and makes it challenging for Carol to reconcile her desire for adventure with Kennicott's inability to accompany her.&#10;&#10;The underlying issue, however, is the growing tension in their relationship due to Carol's discontent and Kennicott's preoccupation with his work.

The Smails believe that the interior of the house is more important than its appearance to outsiders, and this philosophy seems to influence Kennicott's thinking as he plans the construction of their new home.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol has been expressing some reservations about moving into the new house, and Kennicott may sense her reluctance.

The Jolly Seventeen, a group of young matrons, make her nervous with their loud and repetitive jests. She has also grown disillusioned with the puerile methods persisting in housework and questions the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home, which she had previously regarded as the basis of all decent life.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Carol feels that her former friends, like Guy Pollock and Vida, do not provide the intellectual stimulation she seeks. She begins to develop doubts about the conventional views and expectations of women in society, including the role of a wife and mother, and finds it difficult to relate to her old acquaintances who seem content with their traditional roles.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Carol's relationship with her husband, Dr. Will Kennicott, has become distant and less romantic than before. She feels that he is more concerned with his business and reading story-books than with their relationship, and this further alienates her from the social circles she used to move in.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the Bjornstams represent a simpler way of life, free from societal expectations and conventions. They provide Carol with a sense of belonging and acceptance that she fails to find in her former friends, making them a more preferable company for her at this stage in her life.">

She has noticed that he has become more untidy, including licking his knife after eating and having dirty hands, which she takes as a sign of neglect for their relationship due to his increasing focus on business. Additionally, Carol knows that Kennicott has been thinking about other women, such as when he mentioned that Mrs. Carthal's dress was &quot;tight across the hips&quot; or when he commented on another woman's appearance.

Although Kennicott proposes a local convention as a compromise, it does not fulfill Carol's longing for travel and exploration, causing her to question if she wants to spend another summer in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's desire for adventure and change is evident throughout the narrative, and her dissatisfaction with their current situation has been growing due to Kennicott's neglect of their relationship and increasing focus on his business. The prospect of a local convention does not excite her because it represents more of the same monotonous life in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's limited availability for travel is another factor influencing their summer plans. As a doctor, he has responsibilities that prevent him from taking extended time off to go on a long trip with Carol. This limitation further contributes to the tension between them and makes it challenging for Carol to reconcile her desire for adventure with Kennicott's inability to accompany her.&#10;&#10;The underlying issue, however, is the growing tension in their relationship due to Carol's discontent and Kennicott's preoccupation with his work.

She compliments him on being calm and composed, contrasting his demeanor with their noisy son Hugh.&#10;&#10;Carol playfully invites Kennicott to come over to their house in the evening, implying that they could spend some alone time together.

By focusing on practical features like a cement floor and a work-bench for the garage, he may be trying to reassure Carol that the new house will meet their needs and make their lives more convenient.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Kennicott himself is a practical person who values efficiency and functionality.

This illness may be related to the water source, as the dogs in the household have also been sick since switching to a new well.&#10;&#10;Vida Sherwin and her friends visit Carol's house with grapes and magazines after hearing that Bea is sick. However, Miles, who answers the door, rejects their offer of help, expressing his disappointment that they never visited when Bea was healthy. He shuts the door on them, saying &quot;You ain't worth God-damning.&quot;&#10;&#10;Despite Miles' rejection, Carol takes care of Bea and Olaf, who dies from the illness.

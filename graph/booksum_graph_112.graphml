    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer has come to meet his friend Hutter at the rendezvous. He is also bringing a valuable prize, which Hutter plans to use to pay their Indian allies. However, when Deerslayer sees that Hutter and his associates are taking scalps from their enemies, he realizes that they are acting against his moral code. Despite this, when Hutter appeals to him for help in escaping the Indians and protecting his daughters, Deerslayer responds with compassion and resolves to aid them, even at the risk of his own safety. Therefore, Hutter can depend on Deerslayer to stand by him and his daughters in their time of need." />
    <node id=" old Hutter, without removing the pipe&#10;from between his teeth; &quot;he's the likeliest youth in these parts; and&#10;Jude is the likeliest young woman I've met with since her poor mother&#10;was in her best days.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it wicked to be ugly, father?'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One might be guilty of worse things--but you're by no means ugly;&#10;though not so comely as Jude.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is Judith any happier for being so handsome?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She may be, child, and she may not be. But talk of other matters now,&#10;for you hardly understand these, poor Hetty. How do you like our new&#10;acquaintance, Deerslayer?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He isn't handsome, father. Hurry is far handsomer than Deerslayer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's true; but they say he is a noted hunter! His fame had reached&#10;me before I ever saw him; and I did hope he would prove to be as stout&#10;a warrior as he is dexterous with the deer. All men are not alike,&#10;howsever, child; and it takes time, as I know by experience, to give a&#10;man a true wilderness heart.&quot;" />
    <node id=" men,&quot; said Hutter, in a low voice, &quot;and let us&#10;look about us for a moment. We must now be all eyes and ears, for these&#10;vermin have noses like bloodhounds.&quot;&#10;&#10;The shores of the lake were examined closely, in order to discover any&#10;glimmering of light that might have been left in a camp; and the men&#10;strained their eyes, in the obscurity, to see if some thread of smoke&#10;was not still stealing along the mountainside, as it arose from the&#10;dying embers of a fire. Nothing unusual could be traced; and as the&#10;position was at some distance from the outlet, or the spot where the&#10;savages had been met, it was thought safe to land. The paddles were&#10;plied again, and the bows of the canoe ground upon the gravelly beach&#10;with a gentle motion, and a sound barely audible. Hutter and Hurry&#10;immediately landed, the former carrying his own and his friend's rifle,&#10;leaving Deerslayer in charge of the canoe. The hollow log lay a little&#10;distance up the side of the mountain, and the old man led the way&#10;towards it, using so much caution" />
    <node id=" way.&quot;&#10;&#10;The canoe was drawn out of the log with the utmost care, raised by Hurry&#10;to his shoulder, and the two began to return to the shore, moving but&#10;a step at a time, lest they should tumble down the steep declivity. The&#10;distance was not great, but the descent was extremely difficult; and,&#10;towards the end of their little journey, Deerslayer was obliged to land&#10;and meet them, in order to aid in lifting the canoe through the bushes.&#10;With his assistance the task was successfully accomplished, and the&#10;light craft soon floated by the side of the other canoe. This was no&#10;sooner done, than all three turned anxiously towards the forest and the&#10;mountain, expecting an enemy to break out of the one, or to come rushing&#10;down the other. Still the silence was unbroken, and they all embarked&#10;with the caution that had been used in coming ashore.&#10;&#10;Hutter now steered broad off towards the centre of the lake. Having got&#10;a sufficient distance from the shore, he cast his prize loose, knowing&#10;that it would drift slowly up the lake before the light southerly air,&#10;and intending to find it on his return. Thus" />

Here's the Canadas paying their Injins for scalps, and&#10;why not we pay--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Our Indians!&quot; exclaimed the girl, laughing with a sort of melancholy&#10;merriment. &quot;Father, father! think no more of this, and listen to the&#10;advice of Deerslayer, who has a conscience; which is more than I can say&#10;or think of Harry March.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hutter now rose, and, entering the cabin, he compelled his daughters&#10;to go into the adjoining room, when he secured both the doors, and&#10;returned. Then he and Hurry pursued the subject; but, as the purport of&#10;all that was material in this discourse will appear in the narrative,&#10;it need not be related here in detail. The reader, however, can have&#10;no difficulty in comprehending the morality that presided over their&#10;conference. It was, in truth, that which, in some form or other, rules&#10;most of the acts of men, and in which the controlling principle is that&#10;one wrong will justify another. Their enemies paid for scalps, and this&#10;was" />
    <node id=" saw-log that ye must choke too!&quot;&#10;&#10;This speech satisfied Deerslayer that his friends were prisoners,&#10;and that to land would be to share their fate. He was already within a&#10;hundred feet of the shore, when a few timely strokes of the paddle not&#10;only arrested his advance, but forced him off to six or eight times&#10;that distance from his enemies. Luckily for him, all of the Indians had&#10;dropped their rifles in the pursuit, or this retreat might not have been&#10;effected with impunity; though no one had noted the canoe in the first&#10;confusion of the melee.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep off the land, lad,&quot; called out Hutter; &quot;the girls depend only on&#10;you, now; you will want all your caution to escape these savages. Keep&#10;off, and God prosper you, as you aid my children!&quot;&#10;&#10;There was little sympathy in general between Hutter and the young man,&#10;but the bodily and mental anguish with which this appeal was made served&#10;at the moment to conceal from the latter the former's faults. He saw&#10;only the father in his sufferings, and resolved at once to give a pledge&#10;of fidelity to its interests, and to be faithful to his" />

Hetty would make a much safer and more&#10;rational companion than Jude, and would be much the most likely to&#10;listen to your suit, as the officers have, I greatly fear, unsettled her&#10;sister's mind.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No man needs a safer wife than Hetty,&quot; said Hurry, laughing, &quot;though&#10;I'll not answer for her being of the most rational. But no matter;&#10;Deerslayer has not misconceived me, when he told you I should be found&#10;at my post. I'll not quit you, Uncle Tom, just now, whatever may be my&#10;feelin's and intentions respecting your eldest darter.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hurry had a respectable reputation for prowess among his associates,&#10;and Hutter heard this pledge with a satisfaction that was not concealed.&#10;Even the great personal strength of such an aid" />
    <node id="1. Hutter holds a conference with Judith before embarking on the canoe to discuss private matters, possibly related to their plans or the current situation. The narrative mentions that they &quot;held a conference of several minutes,&quot; but it does not provide specific details about what was discussed.&#10;2. Hutter only requires the young man (Deerslayer) to use a paddle for the journey because they are in a hurry and need to act quickly. Additionally, as the passage states, &quot;At any rate, we know you can use a paddle, young man... Let us waste no more time, but get into the canoe, and do, in place of talking.&quot; Hutter is focused on efficiency and practicality, knowing that Deerslayer's paddling skills are sufficient for their immediate needs." />
    <node id=", precisely&#10;in the degree that they feel the consciousness of demerit; &quot;having never&#10;been tried, I'll wait to know, before I form any opinion of myself; and&#10;then there'll be sartainty, instead of bragging. I've heard of them&#10;that was valiant afore the fight, who did little in it; and of them that&#10;waited to know their own tempers, and found that they weren't as bad as&#10;some expected, when put to the proof.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At any rate, we know you can use a paddle, young man,&quot; said Hutter,&#10;&quot;and that's all we shall ask of you to-night. Let us waste no more time,&#10;but get into the canoe, and do, in place of talking.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Hutter led the way, in the execution of his project, the boat was&#10;soon ready, with Hurry and Deerslayer at the paddles. Before the old man&#10;embarked himself, however, he held a conference of several minutes with&#10;Judith, entering the house for that purpose; then, returning, he took&#10;his place in the canoe, which left the side of the ark at the next&#10;instant" />

Now, my idea is just this" />
    <node id=" as much, perhaps, in affected scorn for Hurry, as in&#10;sincerity. Still, it was not said without feeling. The fine face of&#10;Judith sufficiently proved the latter circumstance; and if the conscious&#10;March fancied that he had never seen in it a stronger display of&#10;contempt--a feeling in which the beauty was apt to indulge--than while&#10;she was looking at him, it certainly seldom exhibited more of a womanly&#10;softness and sensibility, than when her speaking blue eyes were turned&#10;on his travelling companion.&#10;&#10;&quot;Leave us, Judith,&quot; Hutter ordered sternly, before either of the young&#10;men could reply; &quot;leave us; and do not return until you come with&#10;the venison and fish. The girl has been spoilt by the flattery of the&#10;officers, who sometimes find their way up here, Master March, and you'll&#10;not think any harm of her silly words.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You never said truer syllable, old Tom,&quot; retorted Hurry, who smarted&#10;under Judith's observations; &quot;the devil-tongued youngsters of the&#10;garrison have proved her undoing!

    <node id="Deerslayer, a frontiersman, has anchored his canoe near the shore of the Glimmerglass, a large lake, using a water plant to hold onto. He is waiting with great suspense for the outcome of a risky endeavor. The time is night, and the lake and its surroundings are immersed in a deep silence, heightened by the gloom of night which adds a sense of sublimity to the solitude. Deerslayer is alone, and the only sound he can hear is the occasional call of a loon, a bird native to American lakes. He is waiting for a signal from his companion, Hurry, who had gone on a separate endeavor. Deerslayer had set the other canoe adrift earlier as part of this hazardous plan. After some time, he grows restless and decides to paddle towards the center of the lake, searching for the lost canoe. He soon finds it and secures it to his own boat. After ensuring that everything is in order, he lies down to catch a few hours of sleep, so he can be prepared for the challenges of the next day. However, he finds it difficult to fall asleep, as his mind is preoccupied with the events of the night, and he keeps picturing them in his head. He also imagines that he hears Hurry's signal, but soon realizes that it is just his ears playing tricks on him. Eventually, he does fall asleep, unaware of how long he will have to wait for the morrow to arrive." />

So light was the movement of the little craft,&#10;and so steady the sweep of its master's arm, that ten minutes had not&#10;elapsed ere it was again approaching the land, having, in that brief&#10;time, passed over fully half a mile of distance. As soon as Deerslayer's&#10;eye caught a glimpse of the rushes, of which there were many growing in&#10;the water a hundred feet from the shore, he arrested the motion of&#10;the canoe, and anchored his boat by holding fast to the delicate&#10;but tenacious stem of one of the drooping plants. Here he remained,&#10;awaiting, with an intensity of suspense that can be easily imagined, the&#10;result of the hazardous enterprise.&#10;&#10;It would be difficult to convey to the minds of those who have never&#10;witnessed it, the sublimity that characterizes the silence of a solitude&#10;as deep as that which now reigned over the Glimmerglass. In the present&#10;instance, this sublimity was increased by the gloom of night, which&#10;threw its shadowy and fantastic forms around the lake, the forest,&#10;and the hills. It is not easy, indeed, to" />
    <node id=" and the forest-bound sheet&#10;of water lay embedded between its mountains, as calm and melancholy as&#10;if never troubled by the winds, or brightened by a noonday sun. Once&#10;more the loon raised his tremulous cry, near the foot of the lake, and&#10;the mystery of the alarm was explained. Deerslayer adjusted his hard&#10;pillow, stretched his form in the bottom of the canoe, and slept.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

It seemed&#10;as if a silence that had never been broken reigned on the spot again;&#10;and, for an instant, even that piercing shriek, which had so lately&#10;broken the stillness of the forest, or the execrations of March, would&#10;have been a relief to the feeling of desertion to which it gave rise.&#10;&#10;This paralysis of mind and body, however, could not last long in one&#10;constituted mentally and physically like Deerslayer. Dropping his paddle&#10;into the water, he turned the head of the canoe, and proceeded slowly,&#10;as one walks who thinks intently, towards the centre of the lake. When&#10;he believed himself to have reached a point in a line with that where&#10;he had set the last canoe adrift, he changed his direction northward,&#10;keeping the light air as nearly on his back as possible. After paddling&#10;a quarter of a mile in this direction, a dark object became visible&#10;on the lake, a little to the right; and turning on one side for the&#10;purpose, he had soon secured his lost prize to his own boat.

It is not easy, indeed, to conceive of any place more&#10;favorable to heighten these natural impressions, than that Deerslayer&#10;now occupied. The size of the lake brought all within the reach of human&#10;senses, while it displayed so much of the imposing scene at a single&#10;view, giving up, as it might be, at a glance, a sufficiency to produce&#10;the deepest impressions. As has been said, this was the first lake&#10;Deerslayer had ever seen. Hitherto, his experience had been limited to&#10;the courses of rivers and smaller streams, and never before had he seen&#10;so much of that wilderness, which he so well loved, spread before&#10;his gaze. Accustomed to the forest, however, his mind was capable&#10;of portraying all its hidden mysteries, as he looked upon its leafy&#10;surface. This was also the first time he had been on a trail where human&#10;lives depended on the issue. His ears had often drunk in the traditions&#10;of frontier warfare, but he had never yet been confronted with an enemy.&#10;&#10;The reader will readily understand, therefore" />
    <node id=", a little to the right; and turning on one side for the&#10;purpose, he had soon secured his lost prize to his own boat. Deerslayer&#10;now examined the heavens, the course of the air, and the position of the&#10;two canoes. Finding nothing in either to induce a change of plan, he lay&#10;down, and prepared to catch a few hours' sleep, that the morrow might&#10;find him equal to its exigencies.&#10;&#10;Although the hardy and the tired sleep profoundly, even in scenes of&#10;danger, it was some time before Deerslayer lost his recollection. His&#10;mind dwelt on what had passed, and his half-conscious faculties kept&#10;figuring the events of the night, in a sort of waking dream. Suddenly&#10;he was up and alert, for he fancied he heard the preconcerted signal of&#10;Hurry summoning him to the shore. But all was still as the grave again.&#10;The canoes were slowly drifting northward, the thoughtful stars were&#10;glimmering in their mild glory over his head, and the forest-bound sheet&#10;of water lay embedded between its mountains, as calm and melancholy as&#10;if never troubled by the winds, or brightened by" />

Deerslayer knew not&#10;whether to rejoice in or to mourn over this cautious delay, for, if&#10;it augured security to his associates, it foretold destruction to the&#10;feeble and innocent.&#10;&#10;It might have been an hour and a half after his companions and he had&#10;parted, when Deerslayer was aroused by a sound that filled him equally&#10;with concern and surprise. The quavering call of a loon arose from&#10;the opposite side of the lake, evidently at no great distance from&#10;its outlet. There was no mistaking the note of this bird, which is&#10;so familiar to all who know the sounds of the American lakes. Shrill,&#10;tremulous, loud, and sufficiently prolonged, it seems the very cry of&#10;warning. It is often raised, also, at night, an exception to the habits&#10;of most of the other feathered inmates of the wilderness; a circumstance&#10;which had induced Hurry to select it as his own signal. There had been&#10;sufficient time, certainly, for the two adventurers to make their way by&#10;" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Tom Hutter expresses his view that there is no significant difference between taking scalps and fingering money, implying that he sees a financial benefit in the act of scalping. This perspective is influenced by his desire to acquire wealth through any means necessary. On the other hand, Hurry's views differ when it comes to the value of white people's and Native Americans' lives. He considers white people as having a natural aversion to being scalped, while viewing Native American lives as less valuable, justifying this by referring to their cultural practices around scalping. Hurry believes that one bad turn deserves another, suggesting an eye-for-an-eye mentality towards violence inflicted on them by the Native Americans.&#10;&#10;The overall impression is that both Tom and Hurry are willing to engage in questionable moral practices for financial gain, with Tom being more evasive about his past experiences and Hurry showing a blatant disregard for Native American lives, further perpetuating racial stereotypes and prejudices." />

I think no more of a red-skin's scalp than I do of a pair&#10;of wolf's ears; and would just as lief finger money for the one as for&#10;the other. With white people 't is different, for they've a nat'ral&#10;avarsion to being scalped; whereas your Indian shaves his head&#10;in readiness for the knife, and leaves a lock of hair by way of&#10;braggadocio, that one can lay hold of in the bargain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's manly, however, and I felt from the first that we had only to&#10;get you on our side, to have your heart and hand,&quot; returned Tom, losing&#10;all" />

I will own, it would be ag'in right for you and me&#10;now, to go into the settlements and bring out scalps, but it's a very&#10;different matter as concerns Indians. A man shouldn't take scalps, if he&#10;isn't ready to be scalped, himself, on fitting occasions. One good turn&#10;desarves another, the world over. That's reason, and I believe it to be&#10;good religion.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, Master Hurry,&quot; again interrupted the rich voice of Judith, &quot;is it&#10;religion to say that one bad turn deserves another?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll never reason ag'in you, Judy, for you beat me with beauty, if you&#10;can't with sense.

I've such a big and bushy head that it's quite&#10;likely they'll indivor to get two scalps off it, for the bounty is a&#10;tempting thing, or old Tom and I wouldn't be in this scrape. Ay--there&#10;they go with their signs ag'in, but if I advise you to land may they eat&#10;me as well as roast me. No, no, Deerslayer--do you keep off where you&#10;are, and after daylight, on no account come within two hundred yards--&quot;&#10;&#10;This injunction of Hurry's was stopped by a hand being rudely slapped&#10;against his mouth, the certain sign that some one in the party&#10;sufficiently understood English to have at length detected the drift of&#10;his discourse. Immediately after, the whole group entered the forest,&#10;Hutter and Hurry apparently" />

What I've been, or what I've seen in youth, is of less&#10;matter now than what the savages are. It's of more account to find out&#10;what will happen in the next twenty-four hours than to talk over what&#10;happened twenty-four years since.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's judgment, Deerslayer; yes, that's sound judgment. Here's Judith&#10;and Hetty to take care of, to say nothing of our own top-knots; and, for&#10;my part, I can sleep as well in the dark as I could under a noonday sun.&#10;To me it's no great matter whether there is light or not, to" />

Deerslayer, I conclude you're of&#10;Hurry's way of thinking, and look upon money 'arned in this way as being&#10;as likely to pass as money 'arned in trapping or hunting.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I've no such feelin', nor any wish to harbor it, not I,&quot; returned&#10;the other. &quot;My gifts are not scalpers' gifts, but such as belong to my&#10;religion and color.

Urgency to rescue Hurry, who has been overpowered by enemies on shore, as indicated by his imprecations and pleas for let-up (for Deerslayer).&#10;4. Awareness of being trapped in the boat with enemies nearby, making landing a risky proposition (for both Deerslayer and Hurry)." />
    <node id=" anguish that had awakened&#10;them was as sudden as it was fearful. The young man released his hold&#10;of the rush, and dashed his paddle into the water; to do, he knew&#10;not what--to steer, he knew not whither. A very few moments, however,&#10;removed his indecision. The breaking of branches, the cracking of&#10;dried sticks, and the fall of feet were distinctly audible; the&#10;sounds appearing to approach the water though in a direction that led&#10;diagonally towards the shore, and a little farther north than the spot&#10;that Deerslayer had been ordered to keep near. Following this clue,&#10;the young man urged the canoe ahead, paying but little attention to the&#10;manner in which he might betray its presence. He had reached a part of&#10;the shore, where its immediate bank was tolerably high and quite steep.&#10;Men were evidently threshing through the bushes and trees on the summit&#10;of this bank, following the line of the shore, as if those who fled&#10;sought a favorable place for descending. Just at this instant five or&#10;six rifles flashed, and the opposite hills gave back, as usual, the&#10;sharp reports in prolonged rolling echoes. One or two" />
    <node id=" this movement, which was accompanied by no little noise,&#10;to be seen, and feeling that there he must take in his companion, if&#10;anywhere, Deerslayer urged the canoe forward to the rescue. His paddle&#10;had not been raised twice, when the voice of Hurry was heard filling&#10;the air with imprecations, and he rolled on the narrow beach, literally&#10;loaded down with enemies. While prostrate, and almost smothered with&#10;his foes, the athletic frontierman gave his loon-call, in a manner&#10;that would have excited laughter under circumstances less terrific. The&#10;figure in the water seemed suddenly to repent his own flight, and&#10;rushed to the shore to aid his companion, but was met and immediately&#10;overpowered by half a dozen fresh pursuers, who, just then, came leaping&#10;down the bank.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let up, you painted riptyles--let up!&quot; cried Hurry, too hard pressed to&#10;be particular about the terms he used; &quot;isn't it enough that I am withed&#10;like a saw-log that ye must choke too!&quot;&#10;&#10;This speech satisfied Deerslayer that his friends were prisoners,&#10;and that to land would be to share" />
    <node id="1. Hurry decides to stay by Uncle Tom's side, despite his feelings for Jude, out of a sense of loyalty and commitment to help Hutter in his plans or endeavors. This is evident when he says, &quot;Deerslayer has not misconceived me, when he told you I should be found at my post.&quot; He wants to maintain his reputation and prove himself as a reliable aid to Hutter.&#10;2. Hutter reacts to this pledge with satisfaction since Hurry's presence provides him with an advantage due to Hurry's strong reputation for prowess among his associates. The text states that Hutter heard this pledge with &quot;a satisfaction that was not concealed.&quot;" />

He has as much as promised that he will enter into this job&#10;with me, on condition that I'll consent.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty began to move her body back and forth, and other-wise to express&#10;mental agitation; but she made no answer for more than a minute.

As for poor Hetty, she's Hetty Hutter, and that's as&#10;much as one can say about the poor thing.

    <node id="1. Hutter's uneasiness is caused by the threat of an imminent attack from the Hurons, who are their enemies. He feels that they need to take action against the Hurons and is contemplating moving from defense to offense. This is evident when he mentions high prices being offered for scalps on both sides and suggests that &quot;our Indians&quot; should be paid as well.&#10;2. Regarding his visitor, Hurry, Hutter has decided to keep him by his side due to Hurry's strong reputation for prowess among his associates and the practical advantage this provides in their current situation. He is pleased that Hurry has pledged to stay, which makes him feel more secure and willing to consider taking offensive action against the Hurons. Hutter appreciates having reinforcements and an experienced ally, especially given the dangerous circumstances they are facing." />

A minute before, Hutter would have been well&#10;content to compromise his danger, by entering into a compact to act only&#10;on the defensive; but no sooner did he feel some security on this&#10;point, than the restlessness of man induced him to think of the means of&#10;carrying the war into the enemy's country.&#10;&#10;&quot;High prices are offered for scalps on both sides,&quot; he observed, with a&#10;grim smile, as if he felt the force of the inducement, at the very time&#10;he wished to affect a superiority to earning money by means that the&#10;ordinary feelings of those who aspire to be civilized men repudiated,&#10;even while they were adopted. &quot;It isn't right, perhaps" />

The&#10;latter had something more on his mind, however, than recollections. His&#10;daughters had no sooner left them, with an expressed intention of going&#10;to bed, than he invited his two companions to follow him again into the&#10;scow. Here the old man opened his project, keeping back the portion that&#10;he had reserved for execution by Hurry and himself.&#10;&#10;&quot;The great object for people posted like ourselves is to command the&#10;water,&quot; he commenced. &quot;So long as there is no other craft on the lake,&#10;a bark canoe is as good as a man-of-war, since the castle will not be&#10;easily taken by swimming. Now, there are but five canoes remaining in&#10;these parts, two of which are mine, and one is Hurry's. These three" />
    <node id="Deerslayer was initially roused from his attempt to sleep by the sound that he thought was Hurry's preconcerted signal, but it turned out to be just his imagination. He then heard the distinct call of a loon, which had been previously agreed upon as Hurry's signal. However, Deerslayer hesitated and waited for another cry, which he deemed more authentic and nearer at hand. Therefore, it was not Hurry's initial signal that roused Deerslayer but rather his own suspicion and attentiveness to the sounds around him." />
    <node id=" warning cry was repeated, and&#10;from the same part of the lake. This time, being on the alert, his&#10;senses were not deceived. Although he had often heard admirable&#10;imitations of this bird, and was no mean adept himself in raising its&#10;notes, he felt satisfied that Hurry, to whose efforts in that way he&#10;had attended, could never so completely and closely follow nature. He&#10;determined, therefore, to disregard that cry, and to wait for one less&#10;perfect and nearer at hand.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer had hardly come to this determination, when the profound&#10;stillness of night and solitude was broken by a cry so startling, as to&#10;drive all recollection of the more melancholy call of the loon from the&#10;listener's mind. It was a shriek of agony, that came either from one&#10;of the female sex, or from a boy so young as not yet to have attained a&#10;manly voice. This appeal could not be mistaken. Heart rending terror--if&#10;not writhing agony--was in the sounds, and the anguish that had awakened&#10;them was as sudden as it was fearful. The young man released his hold&#10;of the rush, and dashed his paddle into the water" />

Hutter and Hurry examined the shores of the lake for any signs of lights or smoke from an enemy camp but found none.&#10;3. They then landed a safe distance from the outlet and ventured up the side of the mountain using caution to reach the hollow log where they had hidden their other canoe.&#10;4. Deerslayer, who was waiting in the initial canoe, was left in charge as Hutter and Hurry went to retrieve the hidden canoe.&#10;5. With all three canoes assembled, Hutter steered towards the center of the lake to avoid any potential threats lurking near the shoreline.&#10;6. Deerslayer, having been on a long journey, slept in the bottom of the canoe as it moved across the calm waters of the lake." />

Thus relieved of his tow, the&#10;old man held his way down the lake, steering towards the very point&#10;where Hurry had made his fruitless attempt on the life of the deer. As&#10;the distance from this point to the outlet was less than a mile, it&#10;was like entering an enemy's country; and redoubled caution became&#10;necessary. They reached the extremity of the point, however, and landed&#10;in safety on the little gravelly beach already mentioned. Unlike the&#10;last place at which they had gone ashore, here was no acclivity to&#10;ascend, the mountains looming up in the darkness quite a quarter of a&#10;mile farther west, leaving a margin of level ground between them and the&#10;strand. The point itself, though long, and covered with tall trees, was&#10;nearly flat, and for some distance only a few yards in width. Hutter and&#10;Hurry landed as before, leaving their companion in charge of the boat.&#10;&#10;In this instance, the dead tree that contained the canoe of which they&#10;had come in quest lay about" />
    <node id="The startling shriek of agony heard near the lake was likely caused by a person, either a woman or a young boy, who was in extreme distress or experiencing severe pain. The source of such heart-rending terror is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is suggested that it might have been due to an attack or danger threatening the individual's life or well-being." />
    <node id="1. After Judith's sudden disappearance, Hutter is surprised and left astonished, as stated in the narrative. His thoughts become so abstracted that he forgets his actual situation and needs to be hailed by Hutter to keep the scow's head in the right direction.&#10;2. Hutter sets a large square sail to take advantage of the light southerly air, indicating his practicality and focus on efficiency. The sail had once been the flying top-sail of an Albany sloop but was sold due to becoming threadbare. This shows that Hutter is resourceful and makes use of what's available to him.&#10;3. Hutter casts loose the beaver trap, knowing it would drift slowly up the lake with the wind, intending to find it on his return. This action demonstrates his planning skills and forward-thinking nature.&#10;4. Hutter and Hurry examine the shores for any signs of lights or smoke from an enemy camp but find none. This suggests that Hutter is cautious and vigilant about potential threats, understanding the risks associated with their situation.&#10;5. After landing a safe distance from the outlet and venturing up the side of the mountain to retrieve their hidden canoe, Hutter leaves Deerslayer in charge of the initial canoe. This shows trust in Deerslayer's abilities and Hutter's focus on ensuring all tasks are covered during their absence.&#10;6. With all three canoes assembled, Hutter steers towards the center of the lake to avoid any potential threats lurking near the shoreline. This further illustrates his caution and vigilance in protecting himself, his daughters, and his associates." />

So abstracted, indeed, had his thoughts&#10;become, that he was hailed by Hutter to keep the scow's head in the&#10;right direction, before he remembered his actual situation.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;So spake the apostate Angel, though in pain,&#10;    Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Paradise lost, I.  125-26.&#10;&#10;Shortly after the disappearance of Judith, a light southerly air arose,&#10;and Hutter set a large square sail, that had once been the flying&#10;top-sail of an Albany sloop, but which having become threadbare in&#10;catching the breezes of Tappan, had been condemned and sold.

As no danger could now&#10;approach unseen, immediate uneasiness had given place to the concern&#10;which attended the conviction that enemies were in considerable force on&#10;the shores of the lake, and that they might be sure no practicable means&#10;of accomplishing their own destruction would be neglected. As a matter&#10;of course Hutter felt these truths the deepest, his daughters having an&#10;habitual reliance on his resources, and knowing too little to appreciate&#10;fully all the risks they ran; while his male companions were at liberty&#10;to quit him at any moment they saw fit. His first remark showed that&#10;he had an eye to the latter circumstance, and might have betrayed, to a&#10;keen observer, the apprehension that was just then uppermost.&#10;&#10;&quot;We've a great advantage over the Iro" />
    <node id=", Judith, this is taking the matter up too much in 'arnest.

Hetty,&#10;indeed! Poor Hetty!&quot; she continued, her voice sinking into low, husky&#10;tones, that seemed nearly to stifle her in the utterance; &quot;she is beyond&#10;and above his slanderous malice! Poor Hetty! If God has created her&#10;feeble-minded, the weakness lies altogether on the side of errors of&#10;which she seems to know nothing. The earth never held a purer being than&#10;Hetty Hutter, Deerslayer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can believe it--yes, I can believe that, Judith, and I hope 'arnestly&#10;that the same can be said of her handsome sister.&quot;&#10;&#10;There was a soothing sincerity in the voice of Deerslayer, which touched&#10;the girl's feelings; nor did the allusion to her beauty lessen the&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Hetty interprets Deerslayer's words to mean that one should treat their enemies in wartime as they would want their own enemies to treat them. Specifically, no one wants to be killed by their enemies, so Hetty believes that one should not kill their enemies. Instead, Hetty thinks that the goal should be to prevent enemies from harming each other, rather than actively trying to kill them." />
    <node id=" children?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Peace, girl, peace; we are at war, and must do to our enemies as our&#10;enemies would do to us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's not it, father!

No man wishes&#10;his enemies to kill him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We kill our enemies in war, girl, lest they should kill us. One side or&#10;the other must begin; and them that begin first, are most apt to get the&#10;victory. You know nothing about these things, poor Hetty, and had best&#10;say nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Judith says it is wrong, father; and Judith has sense though I have&#10;none.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jude understands better than to talk to me of these matters; for she&#10;has sense, as you say, and knows I'll not bear it. Which would you&#10;prefer, Hetty; to have your own scalp taken, and sold to the French, or&#10;that we should kill our enemies, and keep them from harming us?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's not it, father! Don't kill them, nor let them kill" />
    <node id="The final message spoken by the father to Deerslayer before he was left alone in the stillness of the forest was &quot;As you're true to my children, God prosper you, young man!&quot; This message indicates the father's appreciation for Deerslayer's loyalty and protection of his daughters.&#10;&#10; Deerslayer waited several minutes in death-like stillness because at first, he thought he heard Hurry's preconcerted signal, but it turned out to be just his imagination. He then heard the distinct call of a loon, which had been previously agreed upon as Hurry's signal. However, Deerslayer hesitated and waited for another cry, which he deemed more authentic and nearer at hand. Therefore, it was not Hurry's initial signal that roused Deerslayer but rather his own suspicion and attentiveness to the sounds around him." />

Immediately after, the whole group entered the forest,&#10;Hutter and Hurry apparently making no resistance to the movement. Just&#10;as the sounds of the cracking bushes were ceasing, however, the voice of&#10;the father was again heard.&#10;&#10;&quot;As you're true to my children, God prosper you, young man!&quot; were the&#10;words that reached Deerslayer's ears; after which he found himself left&#10;to follow the dictates of his own discretion.&#10;&#10;Several minutes elapsed, in death-like stillness, when the party on the&#10;shore had disappeared in the woods. Owing to the distance--rather more&#10;than two hundred yards--and the obscurity, Deerslayer had been able&#10;barely to distinguish the group, and to see it retiring; but even this&#10;dim connection with human forms gave an animation to the scene that was&#10;strongly in contrast to the absolute solitude that remained. Although&#10;the young man leaned forward to listen, holding his breath and&#10;condensing every faculty in the single sense of hearing, not another&#10;sound reached his ears to denote the vicinity of human beings. It seemed&#10;as if a silence that had never been broken" />
    <node id="1. Hurry's perspective on treating one's enemies is shaped by a sense of retaliation and an eye-for-an-eye mentality, where he believes that if Native Americans are taking white people's scalps, then it is justifiable for white people to do the same to them. He sees it as a matter of reciprocity and does not value Native American lives equally to those of white people.&#10;2. On the other hand, the Moravians' perspective emphasizes forgiveness and non-violence. They advise Tom Hutter that the correct teaching is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&quot; which means treating all human beings with respect and kindness, regardless of their race or actions towards you. The Moravians believe that offering bounties for scalps goes against this principle, and they actively discourage revenge and violence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hurry's perspective on treating one's enemies is driven by a desire for retaliation and reciprocity, while the Moravians' perspective is based on forgiveness and non-violence." />

'Do as you would be done by,' they tell me, is the&#10;true saying, while men practyse the false. They think all the colonies&#10;wrong that offer bounties for scalps, and believe no blessing will&#10;follow the measures. Above all things, they forbid revenge.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That for your Moravians!&quot; cried March, snapping his fingers; &quot;they're&#10;the next thing to Quakers; and if you'd believe all they tell you, not&#10;even a 'rat would be skinned, out of marcy.

    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, Deerslayer is portrayed as a man of action who values deeds over words, unlike Hurry who talks more than he performs. This is evident when Judith comments on this difference between the two men.&#10;2. Deerslayer demonstrates his confidence in his capabilities by waiting for another distinct signal from Hurry, which he deems more authentic and nearer at hand. He trusts his instincts and does not immediately act based on the first signal he thought he heard.&#10;3. Although there are no direct comparisons between Deerslayer and Hurry's battle capabilities in this narrative, it can be inferred that Deerslayer is more cautious and observant, while Hurry tends to act impulsively.&#10;4. Hurry expresses doubts about Deerslayer's abilities when he implies that Deerslayer may have misjudged him. However, Deerslayer remains confident in his own capabilities, as evidenced by his actions and decisions throughout the narrative." />

Hurry Harry has a&#10;tongue, and, giant as he is, he talks more than he performs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;March is your fri'nd, Judith; and fri'nds should be tender of each&#10;other, when apart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We all know what Hurry's friendship comes to! Let him have his own way&#10;in everything, and he's the best fellow in the colony; but 'head him&#10;off,' as you say of the deer, and he is master of everything near him&#10;but himself. Hurry is no favorite of mine, Deerslayer; and I dare say,&#10;if the truth was known, and his conversation about me repeated, it would&#10;be found that he thinks no better of me than I own I do of him.&quot;&#10;&#10;The latter part of this speech was not uttered without uneasiness.

    <node id="There was a soothing sincerity in the voice of Deerslayer, which touched&#10;the girl's feelings; nor did the allusion to her beauty lessen the&#10;effect with one who only knew too well the power of her personal charms.&#10;Nevertheless, the still, small voice of conscience was not hushed, and&#10;it prompted the answer which she made, after giving herself time to&#10;reflect.&#10;&#10;&quot;I dare say Hurry had some of his vile hints about the people of the&#10;garrisons,&quot; she added. &quot;He knows they are gentlemen, and can never&#10;forgive any one for being what he feels he can never become himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not in the sense of a king's officer, Judith, sartainly, for March&#10;has no turn that-a-way; but in the sense of reality, why may not a&#10;beaver-hunter be as respectable as a governor? Since you speak of it&#10;yourself, I'll not deny that he did complain of one as humble as you&#10;being so much in the company of scarlet coats and silken sashes. But 't&#10;was jealousy that brought it out of him, and I do think he mourned over&#10;his own thoughts as a mother" />
    <node id="1. The rational and correct idea proposed by the speaker suggests that the &quot;savages&quot; they encountered on shore might not have hostile intentions, and their initial attempt to attack the group could be due to their instinctive tendency to fall into ambushes and surprises, rather than a deliberate desire to cause harm. The speaker also speculates that these natives could be hunters who are unaware of the ongoing war and the bounties offered for scalps. He bases this assumption on moccasin prints and argues that it is natural for an Indian to fire at them if their conditions were not met, following the usual pattern of behavior in such situations. Therefore, he suggests leaving the children in the young man's care and approaching the natives to negotiate their intentions." />
    <node id="&quot;The young man is right, Hurry,&quot; he said; &quot;and we can leave the children&#10;in his care. Now, my idea is just this; and I think you'll agree that it&#10;is rational and correct. There's a large party of these savages on shore&#10;and, though I didn't tell it before the girls, for they're womanish,&#10;and apt to be troublesome when anything like real work is to be done,&#10;there's women among 'em. This I know from moccasin prints; and 't is&#10;likely they are hunters, after all, who have been out so long that they&#10;know nothing of the war, or of the bounties.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In which case, old Tom, why was their first salute an attempt to cut&#10;our throats?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We don't know that their design was so bloody. It's natural and easy&#10;for an Indian to fall into ambushes and surprises; and, no doubt they&#10;wished to get on board the ark first, and to make their conditions&#10;afterwards. That a disapp'inted savage should fire at us, is in rule;&#10;and I think nothing of that. Besides, how often they burned me out" />

    <node id="According to the instructions given to him by the frontiersmen, the young man named Deerslayer has to canoe himself into the middle of the lake and keep a careful watch on the shore for any signs of movement from the Native American camp. He is to remain outside the point and the rushes, and listen for any signals or sounds that might indicate what is happening on shore. The frontiersmen assure him that they will be able to communicate with him if necessary, using the call of a loon as a signal. Deerslayer is to wait in his canoe and observe the camp, preparing himself for possible armed conflict with the Natives if necessary. Although he has reservations about this plan and would prefer not to engage in violence, Deerslayer knows that it is important to follow the wishes of the frontiersmen in order to ensure the safety of his companions and complete their mission." />

If you hear rifles, and feel like sogering, why,&#10;you may close in, and see if you can make the same hand with the savages&#10;that you do with the deer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If my wishes could be followed, this matter would not be undertaken,&#10;Hurry----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Quite true--nobody denies it, boy; but your wishes can't be followed;&#10;and that inds the matter. So just canoe yourself off into the middle&#10;of the lake, and by the time you get back there'll be movements in that&#10;camp!&quot;&#10;&#10;The young man set about complying with great reluctance and a heavy&#10;heart.

His training had been perfect, so far as theory could&#10;go, and his self-possession, notwithstanding the high excitement, that&#10;was the fruit of novelty, would have done credit to a veteran. The&#10;visible evidences of the existence of the camp, or of the fire could not&#10;be detected from the spot where the canoe lay, and he was compelled to&#10;depend on the sense of hearing alone. He did not feel impatient, for&#10;the lessons he had heard taught him the virtue of patience, and, most&#10;of all, inculcated the necessity of wariness in conducting any covert&#10;assault on the Indians. Once he thought he heard the cracking of a&#10;dried twig, but expectation was so intense it might mislead him. In this&#10;manner minute after minute passed, until the whole time since he left&#10;his companions was extended to quite an hour" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the Mingos are currently engaged in a war-party, as they are out on the trail of mortal men and not for beaver or deer. Additionally, Deerslayer has identified that women are with them, which further supports this conclusion." />
    <node id=" That a disapp'inted savage should fire at us, is in rule;&#10;and I think nothing of that. Besides, how often they burned me out,&#10;and robbed my traps--ay, and pulled trigger on me, in the most peaceful&#10;times?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The blackguards will do such things, I must allow; and we pay 'em off&#10;pretty much in their own c'ine. Women would not be on the war-path,&#10;sartainly; and, so far, there's reason in your idee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nor would a hunter be in his war-paint,&quot; returned Deerslayer. &quot;I saw&#10;the Mingos, and know that they are out on the trail of mortal men; and&#10;not for beaver or deer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There you have it ag'in, old fellow,&quot; said Hurry. &quot;In the way of an&#10;eye, now, I'd as soon trust this young man, as trust the oldest settler&#10;in the colony; if he says paint, why paint it was.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then a hunting-party and a war-party have met, for women must have been&#10;with 'em.

Even a Mingo knows that.&quot;&#10;&#10;This sentiment was uttered with as much simplicity of manner as of&#10;feeling, and Judith rewarded it with a smile so sweet, that even&#10;Deerslayer, who had imbibed a prejudice against the girl in consequence&#10;of Hurry's suspicions of her levity, felt its charm, notwithstanding&#10;half its winning influence was lost in the feeble light. It at once&#10;created a sort of confidence between them, and the discourse was&#10;continued on the part of the hunter, without the lively consciousness&#10;of the character of this coquette of the wilderness, with which it had&#10;certainly commenced.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are a man of deeds, and not of words, I see plainly, Deerslayer,&quot;&#10;continued the beauty" />
    <node id="The loon's cry that Deerslayer hears is actually Hurry's preconcerted signal, which they had agreed upon for communication. However, Deerslayer hesitates and waits for another cry which he deems more authentic and nearer at hand. The loon's call is a natural alarm or warning cry, and in this context, it is used as a signal between Deerslayer and Hurry. When Deerslayer hears the loon's cry, he becomes cautious and alert, trying to determine whether the cry is indeed Hurry's signal or just a wild animal's natural call. This demonstrates Deerslayer's attentiveness and suspicion towards his surroundings, which is crucial for his safety and mission." />
    <node id="The old man, Deerslayer, led the way along the eastern side of the belt with confidence because he had landed at the point specifically to get a glimpse into the bay and ensure that the coast was clear. He wanted to make sure there were no immediate dangers before proceeding. They launched the canoe at the nearest favorable spot instead of bringing it to Deerslayer because they now had all the boats on the lake, which increased their confidence and reduced their anxiety about having enough boats for everyone. This allowed them to distribute the weight of the canoes more evenly among the group, reducing the risk of capsizing or getting stranded." />

He had landed at the point expressly to get&#10;a glimpse into the bay and to make certain that the coast was clear;&#10;otherwise he would have come ashore directly abreast of the hollow tree.&#10;There was no difficulty in finding the latter, from which the canoe&#10;was drawn as before, and instead of carrying it down to the place where&#10;Deerslayer lay, it was launched at the nearest favorable spot. As soon&#10;as it was in the water, Hurry entered it, and paddled round to the&#10;point, whither Hutter also proceeded, following the beach. As the&#10;three men had now in their possession all the boats on the lake, their&#10;confidence was greatly increased, and there was no longer the same&#10;feverish desire to" />
    <node id="An hour after the soft twilight of a summer evening, the scene on the lake has changed with the gloom. The forests around the placid and glassy lake have become quiet, giving up no sound, song, or cry, and looking down on the lovely basin they encircle in solemn stillness. The only sound audible is the regular dip of the sweeps as Hurry and Deerslayer lazily push the scow towards the castle. Hutter has withdrawn to the stern of the scow to steer, but finding that the young men are keeping even strokes and holding the desired course, he permits the oar to drag in the water, takes a seat on the end of the vessel, and lights his pipe. Hetty comes stealthily out of the cabin and places herself at Hutter's feet, where she sings a simple homage that touches the men forward, causing them to stop rowing until her song ends. Hutter is much affected by her singing, and there is a solemn calm on the lake, with no signs of danger observed by Hutter as he examines the sky, the lake, and the belt of forest." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;An hour later the scene had greatly changed. The lake was still placid&#10;and glassy, but the gloom of the hour had succeeded to the soft twilight&#10;of a summer evening, and all within the dark setting of the woods lay in&#10;the quiet repose of night. The forests gave up no song, or cry, or&#10;even murmur, but looked down from the hills on the lovely basin they&#10;encircled, in solemn stillness; and the only sound that was audible&#10;was the regular dip of the sweeps, at which Hurry and Deerslayer lazily&#10;pushed, impelling the ark towards the castle. Hutter had withdrawn to&#10;the stern of the scow, in order to steer, but, finding that the young&#10;men kept even strokes, and held the desired course by their own skill,&#10;he permitted the oar to drag in the water, took a seat on the end of the&#10;vessel, and lighted his pipe. He had not been thus placed many minutes,&#10;ere Hetty came stealthily out of the cabin, or house, as they usually&#10;termed that part of the ark, and placed herself at his feet, on a&#10;little bench that" />

As if she gathered courage with the theme,&#10;her powers appeared to increase as she proceeded; and though nothing&#10;vulgar or noisy mingled in her melody, its strength and melancholy&#10;tenderness grew on the ear, until the air was filled with this simple&#10;homage of a soul that seemed almost spotless. That the men forward&#10;were not indifferent to this touching interruption, was proved by their&#10;inaction; nor did their oars again dip until the last of the sweet&#10;sounds had actually died among the remarkable shores, which, at that&#10;witching hour, would waft even the lowest modulations of the human voice&#10;more than a mile. Hutter was much affected; for rude as he was by early&#10;habits, and even ruthless as he had got to be by long exposure to the&#10;practices of the wilderness, his nature was of that fearful mixture of" />

He looked about him in silence for quite&#10;a minute, examining the sky, the lake, and the belt of forest which&#10;inclosed it, as it might be hermetically, like one consulting their&#10;signs. Nor did he find any alarming symptoms. The boundless woods were&#10;sleeping in the deep repose of nature, the heavens were placid, but&#10;still luminous with the light of the retreating sun, while the lake&#10;looked more lovely and calm than it had before done that day. It was a&#10;scene altogether soothing, and of a character to lull the passions into&#10;a species of holy calm. How far this effect was produced, however, on&#10;the party in the ark, must appear in the progress of" />
    <node id="1. The first character's opinion on ensuring survival and avoiding danger is to approach the &quot;savages&quot; with caution and an open mind, rather than assuming they are hostile. This character suggests negotiating with them and considering the possibility that they may be unaware of the ongoing war and the bounties offered for scalps. They believe that by leaving the children in the young man's care and approaching the natives, they can better understand their intentions and avoid conflict if possible.&#10;2. The second character, Deerslayer, ensures survival and avoids danger by being cautious and observant. He waits for a more authentic signal from Hurry before taking action and demonstrates confidence in his own abilities. While waiting, he remains vigilant for any signs of movement or danger on the shore. Additionally, he follows the frontiersmen's instructions to canoe himself into the middle of the lake and keep watch, even though it goes against his preference for non-violence.&#10;&#10;In summary, the two characters' opinions on ensuring survival and avoiding danger involve approaching unknown situations with caution, being observant and prepared for potential threats, and maintaining confidence in one's abilities while remaining open to negotiation and understanding others' intentions." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative and Judith's opinion of Hurry's character, Deerslayer cannot place a high level of reliance on Hurry's commitment. Judith has described Hurry as impulsive and someone who values appearance over substance. She explicitly states that her family should not depend much on Hurry, implying that he may not be trustworthy in critical situations. Although Hurry has pledged to stay by Hutter's side out of a sense of loyalty and commitment, his past actions might not support this promise. Deerslayer, being an observant and cautious individual, would likely consider Judith's opinion when assessing the level of trust to place in Hurry." />

In&#10;this strait you may count on me, through all advarsities; and I think&#10;Hurry does discredit to his natur' and wishes, if you can't count on&#10;him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not he,&quot; cried Judith, thrusting her handsome face out of the door;&#10;&quot;his nature is hurry, as well as his name, and he'll hurry off, as&#10;soon as he thinks his fine figure in danger.

Still, it was not said without feeling. The fine face of&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Judith has a strong emotional reaction to Deerslayer's defense of Hetty because she feels that Deerslayer is indirectly implying that she, Judith, is not pure and above reproach like Hetty. Judith takes this as a personal insult and interrupts Deerslayer to express her indignation.&#10;2. Deerslayer responds to Judith's reaction by speaking in soothing and sincere tones, which have a calming effect on her. He also compliments her by saying that he can believe that she is pure and without error, just like Hetty. This allusion to Judith's beauty and goodness serves to further comfort her and smooth over any lingering tension between them." />

When he reached the forward end of&#10;the scow, he manifested an intention to relieve Deerslayer at the oar,&#10;directing the latter to take his own place aft. By these changes, the&#10;old man and Hurry were again left alone, while the young hunter was&#10;transferred to the other end of the ark.&#10;&#10;Hetty had disappeared when Deerslayer reached his new post, and for some&#10;little time he directed the course of the slow-moving craft by himself.&#10;It was not long, however, before Judith came out of the cabin, as if&#10;disposed to do the honors of the place to a stranger engaged in the&#10;service of her family. The starlight was sufficient to permit objects to&#10;be plainly distinguished when near at hand, and the bright eyes of the&#10;girl had an expression of kindness in them, when they met those of the&#10;youth, that the latter was easily enabled to discover. Her rich&#10;hair shaded her spirited and yet soft countenance, even at that hour&#10;rendering it the more beautiful--as the rose is loveliest when reposing&#10;amid the shadows and contrasts of its native foliage." />
    <node id="1. Remain calm and vigilant: It is essential to stay calm and not panic in order to make rational decisions. Vigilance is also crucial for detecting any signs of danger or movement from the Native American camp.&#10;&#10;2. Follow the plan of action: The group should continue following the frontiersmen's instructions, which include having Deerslayer observe the camp and wait for a signal. This will help them gather more information about the Natives' intentions and avoid unnecessary conflict.&#10;&#10;3. Communicate using signals: Using prearranged signals like the call of a loon can help the group communicate effectively without directly exposing themselves to potential danger.&#10;&#10;4. Be prepared for possible armed conflict: Although Deerslayer prefers non-violence, it is important to be prepared for potential threats and defend themselves if necessary. This may involve having weapons at the ready and being strategically positioned.&#10;&#10;5. Negotiate with the Natives: If an opportunity arises, try to communicate with the Natives and understand their intentions. It is possible that they are unaware of the ongoing war or the bounties offered for scalps, which could help avoid unnecessary conflict.&#10;&#10;6. Keep children safe: Leaving the children in the care of a trusted and capable individual can help ensure their safety while adults handle the situation with the Natives.&#10;&#10;7. Stay together if possible: While being trapped in a boat with enemies nearby can be risky, staying together as a group may provide some level of security and make it easier to coordinate responses to potential threats. However, this decision should be made carefully, considering the specific circumstances and potential risks involved." />
    <node id="1. Judith does not hold a high opinion of Hurry Harry and considers him untrustworthy. She describes him as someone who values appearance over substance and is more talk than action. She also mentions that he is impulsive and may not be reliable in critical situations.&#10;2. Judith's reaction to Deerslayer's defense of Hetty suggests that she takes it as a personal insult, implying that she feels Deerslayer is indirectly criticizing her character. This reaction also indicates that Judith has a strong emotional connection to Deerslayer and values his opinion of her.&#10;3. Overall, Judith's conversation with Deerslayer reveals that she has a negative view of Hurry Harry and does not trust him. She sees Deerslayer as a more reliable and trustworthy individual, which is evident in her willingness to rely on him for support and protection." />
    <node id="1. Master Hutter's intentions for discussing his situation with his friends are to address the imminent threat from the Hurons and consider transitioning from defense to offense. He wants to hear their opinions on what actions should be taken, as he feels vulnerable due to being burnt out three times already.&#10;2. The fact that Hutter has been burnt out three times on the shore affects their plans because it shows that their current defensive position is not secure. This may lead him to consider taking a more aggressive stance by paying &quot;our Indians&quot; to attack the Hurons, as mentioned earlier in the narrative. Having reinforcements like Hurry and Deerslayer makes this option more feasible, as they provide additional manpower and expertise.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hutter gathers his friends to discuss their situation and contemplate taking offensive action against the Hurons due to the increased vulnerability from being burnt out multiple times on the shore. He values the input of others and will likely consider any suggestions made during this discussion." />

    <node id="1. Hetty questions her father's intention to harm women and children during wartime because of her strong moral objections to violence and killing. She interprets Deerslayer's words to mean that one should treat their enemies in wartime as they would want their own enemies to treat them, which leads her to believe that it is wrong to kill or harm anyone, regardless of whether they are considered enemies or not.&#10;2. Additionally, Hetty has a gentle and innocent nature, and she values the principles of kindness, compassion, and non-violence. She is particularly protective of women and children, and cannot bring herself to condone any actions that may harm them.&#10;3. Finally, Hetty's question may also reflect her lack of understanding or experience with war and its practices. As a young girl who has grown up in the wilderness, she may not fully grasp the harsh realities of conflict and the necessity of violence for survival." />

    <node id="HEY THERE! I'd be happy to help you answer your question. Based on the information provided, Hutter asked Deerslayer to use a paddle during their journey in the canoe because of efficiency and practicality. They were in a hurry and needed to act quickly, so utilizing Deerslayer's paddling skills was sufficient for their immediate needs. The private conference between Hutter and Judith before the trip does not seem directly related to this decision but might have been about other aspects of their plans or situation." />
    <node id="Deerslayer is hesitating to respond to the loon's call, which he knows is Hurry's preconcerted signal, because he wants to make sure that the cry is authentic and not just a wild animal's natural call. He is being cautious and alert, trying to determine whether the cry is indeed Hurry's signal or just a coincidence. Deerslayer understands that responding to the signal without proper verification could put himself and those who depend on him in danger, as it might attract unwanted attention from their enemies. Therefore, his hesitation reflects his attentiveness and suspicion towards his surroundings, which is crucial for his safety and mission. The consequences of neglecting the signal could be dire, but responding to a false alarm could also have negative implications." />

This demonstrates Deerslayer's attentiveness and suspicion towards his surroundings, which is crucial for his safety and mission.">

Hurry believes that one bad turn deserves another, suggesting an eye-for-an-eye mentality towards violence inflicted on them by the Native Americans.&#10;&#10;The overall impression is that both Tom and Hurry are willing to engage in questionable moral practices for financial gain, with Tom being more evasive about his past experiences and Hurry showing a blatant disregard for Native American lives, further perpetuating racial stereotypes and prejudices." target="1. Hurry's perspective on treating one's enemies is shaped by a sense of retaliation and an eye-for-an-eye mentality, where he believes that if Native Americans are taking white people's scalps, then it is justifiable for white people to do the same to them. He sees it as a matter of reciprocity and does not value Native American lives equally to those of white people.&#10;2. On the other hand, the Moravians' perspective emphasizes forgiveness and non-violence. They advise Tom Hutter that the correct teaching is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&quot; which means treating all human beings with respect and kindness, regardless of their race or actions towards you. The Moravians believe that offering bounties for scalps goes against this principle, and they actively discourage revenge and violence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hurry's perspective on treating one's enemies is driven by a desire for retaliation and reciprocity, while the Moravians' perspective is based on forgiveness and non-violence.">

The sail had once been the flying top-sail of an Albany sloop but was sold due to becoming threadbare. This shows that Hutter is resourceful and makes use of what's available to him.&#10;3. Hutter casts loose the beaver trap, knowing it would drift slowly up the lake with the wind, intending to find it on his return. This action demonstrates his planning skills and forward-thinking nature.&#10;4. Hutter and Hurry examine the shores for any signs of lights or smoke from an enemy camp but find none. This suggests that Hutter is cautious and vigilant about potential threats, understanding the risks associated with their situation.&#10;5. After landing a safe distance from the outlet and venturing up the side of the mountain to retrieve their hidden canoe, Hutter leaves Deerslayer in charge of the initial canoe. This shows trust in Deerslayer's abilities and Hutter's focus on ensuring all tasks are covered during their absence.&#10;6. With all three canoes assembled, Hutter steers towards the center of the lake to avoid any potential threats lurking near the shoreline. This further illustrates his caution and vigilance in protecting himself, his daughters, and his associates.">

Hurry's perspective on treating one's enemies is shaped by a sense of retaliation and an eye-for-an-eye mentality, where he believes that if Native Americans are taking white people's scalps, then it is justifiable for white people to do the same to them.

On the other hand, the Moravians' perspective emphasizes forgiveness and non-violence. They advise Tom Hutter that the correct teaching is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&quot; which means treating all human beings with respect and kindness, regardless of their race or actions towards you. The Moravians believe that offering bounties for scalps goes against this principle, and they actively discourage revenge and violence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hurry's perspective on treating one's enemies is driven by a desire for retaliation and reciprocity, while the Moravians' perspective is based on forgiveness and non-violence.">

Remain calm and vigilant: It is essential to stay calm and not panic in order to make rational decisions.

The rational and correct idea proposed by the speaker suggests that the &quot;savages&quot; they encountered on shore might not have hostile intentions, and their initial attempt to attack the group could be due to their instinctive tendency to fall into ambushes and surprises, rather than a deliberate desire to cause harm. The speaker also speculates that these natives could be hunters who are unaware of the ongoing war and the bounties offered for scalps. He bases this assumption on moccasin prints and argues that it is natural for an Indian to fire at them if their conditions were not met, following the usual pattern of behavior in such situations.

Remain calm and vigilant: It is essential to stay calm and not panic in order to make rational decisions. Vigilance is also crucial for detecting any signs of danger or movement from the Native American camp.&#10;&#10;2. Follow the plan of action: The group should continue following the frontiersmen's instructions, which include having Deerslayer observe the camp and wait for a signal. This will help them gather more information about the Natives' intentions and avoid unnecessary conflict.&#10;&#10;3. Communicate using signals: Using prearranged signals like the call of a loon can help the group communicate effectively without directly exposing themselves to potential danger.&#10;&#10;4. Be prepared for possible armed conflict: Although Deerslayer prefers non-violence, it is important to be prepared for potential threats and defend themselves if necessary. This may involve having weapons at the ready and being strategically positioned.&#10;&#10;5. Negotiate with the Natives: If an opportunity arises, try to communicate with the Natives and understand their intentions. It is possible that they are unaware of the ongoing war or the bounties offered for scalps, which could help avoid unnecessary conflict.&#10;&#10;6. Keep children safe: Leaving the children in the care of a trusted and capable individual can help ensure their safety while adults handle the situation with the Natives.&#10;&#10;7. Stay together if possible: While being trapped in a boat with enemies nearby can be risky, staying together as a group may provide some level of security and make it easier to coordinate responses to potential threats.

The forests around the placid and glassy lake have become quiet, giving up no sound, song, or cry, and looking down on the lovely basin they encircle in solemn stillness. The only sound audible is the regular dip of the sweeps as Hurry and Deerslayer lazily push the scow towards the castle. Hutter has withdrawn to the stern of the scow to steer, but finding that the young men are keeping even strokes and holding the desired course, he permits the oar to drag in the water, takes a seat on the end of the vessel, and lights his pipe. Hetty comes stealthily out of the cabin and places herself at Hutter's feet, where she sings a simple homage that touches the men forward, causing them to stop rowing until her song ends. Hutter is much affected by her singing, and there is a solemn calm on the lake, with no signs of danger observed by Hutter as he examines the sky, the lake, and the belt of forest.">

Stay together if possible: While being trapped in a boat with enemies nearby can be risky, staying together as a group may provide some level of security and make it easier to coordinate responses to potential threats. However, this decision should be made carefully, considering the specific circumstances and potential risks involved.">

Be prepared for possible armed conflict: Although Deerslayer prefers non-violence, it is important to be prepared for potential threats and defend themselves if necessary.

He wants to hear their opinions on what actions should be taken, as he feels vulnerable due to being burnt out three times already.&#10;2. The fact that Hutter has been burnt out three times on the shore affects their plans because it shows that their current defensive position is not secure. This may lead him to consider taking a more aggressive stance by paying &quot;our Indians&quot; to attack the Hurons, as mentioned earlier in the narrative. Having reinforcements like Hurry and Deerslayer makes this option more feasible, as they provide additional manpower and expertise.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hutter gathers his friends to discuss their situation and contemplate taking offensive action against the Hurons due to the increased vulnerability from being burnt out multiple times on the shore.

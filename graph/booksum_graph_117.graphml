    <node id="The scene described is an observation of a group of Native American warriors, women, and children gathered around a fire in the woods. The mood of the group is one of relaxation and enjoyment, as many of the warriors are absent and those present are engaged in leisure activities. Rivenoak, a notable figure among them, is seated in a prominent position and is showing another tribe member one of the elephants that caused sensation among his people. The presence of Deerslayer's friend Chingachgook is also noted, with the Huron maidens being encouraged to open their eyes wide to see him. Overall, the scene is described as peaceful and serene, with the Native Americans enjoying each other's company and the natural surroundings." />

A boy was looking over&#10;his shoulder, in dull curiosity, completing the group. More in the&#10;background eight or ten warriors lay half recumbent on the ground, or&#10;sat with their backs reclining against trees, so many types of indolent&#10;repose. Their arms were near them all, sometimes leaning against the&#10;same trees as themselves, or were lying across their bodies in careless&#10;preparation. But the group that most attracted the attention of&#10;Deerslayer was that composed of the women and children. All the females&#10;appeared to be collected together, and, almost as a" />

Is there no young&#10;warrior of that race? Let the Huron maidens open their eyes wider, and&#10;they may see one called Chingachgook, who is as stately as a young ash,&#10;and as tough as the hickory.&quot;&#10;&#10;As the girl used her figurative language and told her companions to&#10;&quot;open their eyes, and they would see&quot; the Delaware, Deerslayer thrust&#10;his fingers into the sides of his friend, and indulged in a fit of his&#10;hearty, benevolent laughter. The other smiled; but the language of the&#10;speaker was too flattering, and the tones of her voice too sweet for&#10;him to be led away by any accidental coincidence, however ludicrous. The&#10;speech of Hist produced a retort, and the dispute, though conducted in&#10;good-humour, and without any of the coarse violence of tone and gesture&#10;that often impairs the charms of the sex in what is called civilized&#10;life, grew warm and slightly clamorous. In the midst of this" />

As if satisfied with what he beheld, he drew&#10;near Hurry, and took the bundle of sticks into his own hand, examining&#10;it attentively.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, this is an Indian declaration of war, sure enough,&quot; he said,&#10;&quot;and it's a proof how little you're suited to be on the path it has&#10;travelled, Harry March, that it has" />

Once or twice&#10;he started, as he thought he recognized her laugh; but his ears were&#10;deceived by the soft melody that is so common to the Indian female&#10;voice. At length the old woman spoke loud and angrily, and then he&#10;caught a glimpse of one or two dark figures in the background of trees,&#10;which turned as if obedient to the rebuke, and walked more within the&#10;circle of the light. A young warrior's form first came fairly into&#10;view; then followed two youthful females, one of whom proved to be the&#10;Delaware girl. Deerslayer now comprehended it all. Hist was watched,&#10;possibly by her young companion, certainly by the old woman. The youth&#10;was probably some suitor of either her or her companion; but even his&#10;discretion was distrusted under the influence of his admiration. The&#10;known vicinity of those who might be supposed to be her friends, and the&#10;arrival of a strange red man on the lake had induced more than the usual&#10;care, and the girl had not been able to slip away from those who watched&#10;her in order to keep her appointment. Deerslayer traced her uneasiness&#10;by her attempting once" />
    <node id=", the Indian apprehending that they must have&#10;mistaken the place of rendezvous. But Deerslayer thought it was probable&#10;they had mistaken the hour. While he was yet speaking, he grasped the&#10;arm of the Delaware, caused him to turn his head in the direction of&#10;the lake, and pointed towards the summits of the eastern mountains.&#10;The clouds had broken a little, apparently behind rather than above the&#10;hills, and the evening star was glittering among the branches of a pine.&#10;This was every way a flattering omen, and the young men leaned on their&#10;rifles, listening intently for the sound of approaching footsteps.&#10;Voices they often heard, and mingled with them were the suppressed cries&#10;of children, and the low but sweet laugh of Indian women. As the&#10;native Americans are habitually cautious, and seldom break out in loud&#10;conversation, the adventurers knew by these facts that they must be&#10;very near the encampment. It was easy to perceive that there was a fire&#10;within the woods, by the manner in which some of the upper branches of&#10;the trees were illuminated, but it was not possible, where they stood,&#10;to ascertain exactly how near it was to themselves" />

This came upon him suddenly, and a&#10;little unexpectedly, at first causing an alarm, lest he had incautiously&#10;ventured within the circle of light it cast. But perceiving at a second&#10;glance that he was certainly safe from detection, so long as the Indians&#10;kept near the centre of the illumination, he brought the canoe to&#10;a state of rest in the most favourable position he could find, and&#10;commenced his observations.&#10;&#10;We have written much, but in vain, concerning this extraordinary being,&#10;if the reader requires now to be told, that, untutored as he was in the&#10;learning of the world, and simple as he ever showed himself to be in all&#10;matters touching the subtleties of conventional taste, he was a man&#10;of strong, native, poetical feeling. He loved the woods for their&#10;freshness, their sublime solitudes, their vastness, and the impress&#10;" />
    <node id="The careful approach Chingachgook takes to reconnaitre the interior of a nearby hut is described by the narrator as being similar to the wily advances of a cat on a bird. This suggests that Chingachgook moves stealthily and quietly, making himself as small and inconspicuous as possible in order to avoid detection by the enemies inside the hut. He crawls on his hands and knees, staying low to the ground and using the cover of darkness to his advantage. This careful and deliberate approach allows Chingachgook to gather information about the layout and occupants of the hut without putting himself in unnecessary danger." />

We say stood, for all three were&#10;so skilled in the management of that species of frail bark, as to be&#10;able to keep erect positions in the midst of the darkness. The approach&#10;to the shore was made with great caution, and the landing effected in&#10;safety. The three now prepared their arms, and began their tiger-like&#10;approach upon the camp. The Indian was on the lead, his two companions&#10;treading in his footsteps with a stealthy cautiousness of manner that&#10;rendered their progress almost literally noiseless. Occasionally a&#10;dried twig snapped under the heavy weight of the gigantic Hurry, or the&#10;blundering clumsiness of the old man; but, had the Indian walked on air,&#10;his step could not have seemed lighter. The great object was first to&#10;discover the position of the fire, which was known to be the centre of&#10;the whole encampment. At length the keen eye of Chingachgook caught a&#10;glimpse of this important guide. It was glimmering at a distance among&#10;the trunks of trees. There was no blaze, but merely a single smouldering" />
    <node id=" this important guide. It was glimmering at a distance among&#10;the trunks of trees. There was no blaze, but merely a single smouldering&#10;brand, as suited the hour; the savages usually retiring and rising with&#10;the revolutions of the sun.&#10;&#10;As soon as a view was obtained of this beacon, the progress of the&#10;adventurers became swifter and more certain. In a few minutes they got&#10;to the edge of the circle of little huts. Here they stopped to survey&#10;their ground, and to concert their movements. The darkness was so deep&#10;as to render it difficult to distinguish anything but the glowing brand,&#10;the trunks of the nearest trees, and the endless canopy of leaves that&#10;veiled the clouded heaven. It was ascertained, however, that a hut was&#10;quite near, and Chingachgook attempted to reconnnoitre its interior.&#10;The manner in which the Indian approached the place that was supposed to&#10;contain enemies, resembled the wily advances of the cat on the bird. As&#10;he drew near, he stooped to his hands and knees, for the entrance was so&#10;low as to require this attitude, even as a convenience. Before trusting" />
    <node id=" the most&#10;exacting mistress. Deerslayer kept the craft as much in the bays as was&#10;prudent, for the double purpose of sailing within the shadows of the&#10;woods, and of detecting any signs of an encampment they might pass on&#10;the shore. In this manner they doubled one low point, and were already&#10;in the bay that was terminated north by the goal at which they aimed.&#10;The latter was still a quarter of a mile distant, when Chingachgook&#10;came silently to the side of his friend and pointed to a place directly&#10;ahead. A small fire was glimmering just within the verge of the bushes&#10;that lined the shore on the southern side of the point--leaving no doubt&#10;that the Indians had suddenly removed their camp to the very place,&#10;or at least the very projection of land where Hist had given them the&#10;rendezvous!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I hear thee babbling to the vale&#10;    Of sunshine and of flowers,&#10;    But unto me thou bring'st a tale&#10;    Of visionary hours.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Wordsworth.&#10;&#10;One discovery mentioned at the close of the preceding chapter was of&#10;great" />

Sartainly there has been no onset, and 'tis most likely that&#10;the camp's deserted, and the men are comin' back disapp'inted. That&#10;accounts for the growls of Hurry and the silence of the Sarpent.&quot;&#10;&#10;Just at this instant a fall of a paddle was heard in the canoe, for&#10;vexation made March reckless. Deerslayer felt convinced that his&#10;conjecture was true. The sail being down, the ark had not drifted&#10;far; and ere many minutes he heard Chingachgook, in a low, quiet tone,&#10;directing Hutter how to steer in order to reach it. In less time than it&#10;takes to tell the fact, the canoe touched the scow, and the adventurers&#10;entered the latter. Neither Hutter nor Hurry spoke of what had" />

Should he remain, however, much longer where he was,&#10;there was great danger that the impatience of his friend would drive him&#10;into some act of imprudence. At each instant, indeed, he expected to see&#10;the swarthy form of the Delaware appearing in the background, like the&#10;tiger prowling around the fold. Taking all things into consideration,&#10;therefore, he came to the conclusion it would be better to rejoin his&#10;friend, and endeavour to temper his impetuosity by some of his own&#10;coolness and discretion. It required but a minute or two to put this&#10;plan in execution, the canoe returning to the strand some ten or fifteen&#10;minutes after it had left it.&#10;&#10;Contrary to his expectations, perhaps, Deerslayer found the Indian at&#10;his post, from which he had not stirred, fearful that his betrothed&#10;might arrive during his absence. A conference followed, in which&#10;Chingachgook was made" />
    <node id="Based on the given text, the Native American women are gathered near each other, with young females and possibly a suitor present. They are located at a distance of about fifteen yards from Deerslayer and the Delaware warrior, making it necessary for Deerslayer to be cautious in his movements and speech to avoid detection. The women are engaged in low conversation, and their laughter can occasionally be heard, indicating a relaxed and light-hearted mood. However, one older woman is shown to be watching over the group with a &quot;watchful sour aspect,&quot; suggesting that some level of supervision or protection is taking place. Overall, the Native American women in this text are depicted as being vigilant and cautious, while also engaging in leisure activities and socializing with each other." />
    <node id=" the attention of&#10;Deerslayer was that composed of the women and children. All the females&#10;appeared to be collected together, and, almost as a matter of course,&#10;their young were near them. The former laughed and chatted in their&#10;rebuked and quiet manner, though one who knew the habits of the people&#10;might have detected that everything was not going on in its usual train.&#10;Most of the young women seemed to be light-hearted enough; but one old&#10;hag was seated apart with a watchful soured aspect, which the hunter at&#10;once knew betokened that some duty of an unpleasant character had been&#10;assigned her by the chiefs. What that duty was, he had no means of&#10;knowing; but he felt satisfied it must be in some measure connected with&#10;her own sex, the aged among the women generally being chosen for such&#10;offices and no other.&#10;&#10;As a matter of course, Deerslayer looked eagerly and anxiously for the&#10;form of Hist. She was nowhere visible though the light penetrated to&#10;considerable distances in all directions around the fire. Once or twice&#10;he started, as he thought he recognized her laugh; but his ears were&#10;deceived by the soft" />
    <node id="arded in&#10;saying that they were quite as plausible, and far more ingenious, than&#10;half the conjectures that precede the demonstrations of science. However&#10;much they may have been at fault as to their conclusions and inferences,&#10;it is certain that they discussed the questions with a zealous and most&#10;undivided attention. For the time being all else was forgotten, and our&#10;adventurers could not have approached at a more fortunate instant.&#10;&#10;The females were collected near each other, much as Deerslayer had last&#10;seen them, nearly in a line between the place where he now stood and the&#10;fire. The distance from the oak against which the young men leaned and&#10;the warriors was about thirty yards; the women may have been half that&#10;number of yards nigher. The latter, indeed, were so near as to make the&#10;utmost circumspection, as to motion and noise, indispensable. Although&#10;they conversed in their low, soft voices it was possible, in the&#10;profound stillness of the woods, even to catch passages of the&#10;discourse; and the light-hearted laugh that escaped the girls might&#10;occasionally have reached the canoe. Deerslayer felt the tremolo that&#10;pass" />
    <node id=" some of the upper branches of&#10;the trees were illuminated, but it was not possible, where they stood,&#10;to ascertain exactly how near it was to themselves. Once or twice, it&#10;seemed as if stragglers from around the fire were approaching the place&#10;of rendezvous; but these sounds were either altogether illusion, or&#10;those who had drawn near returned again without coming to the shore. A&#10;quarter of an hour was passed in this state of intense expectation and&#10;anxiety, when Deerslayer proposed that they should circle the point in&#10;the canoe; and by getting a position close in, where the camp could be&#10;seen, reconnoitre the Indians, and thus enable themselves to form some&#10;plausible conjectures for the non-appearance of Hist. The Delaware,&#10;however, resolutely refused to quit the spot, reasonably enough offering&#10;as a reason the disappointment of the girl, should she arrive in his&#10;absence. Deerslayer felt for his friend's concern, and offered to make&#10;the circuit of the point by himself, leaving the latter concealed in the&#10;bushes to await the occurrence of any fortunate event that might favour&#10;his views. With this understanding, then, the parties separated.&#10;" />
    <node id="The major discoveries that led Deerslayer and his friend Chingachgook to make new arrangements and be more cautious include:&#10;&#10;1. The danger of Hutter and Hurry making a fresh attempt on their camp, especially if they woke up and discovered its position. This led them to arrange for the two others to continue sleeping and move the ark more slowly.&#10;2. The increased risk of landing to bring off Hist, due to the uncertainty and additional hazards caused by the enemies changing their positions.&#10;3. The need to hide their fire from potential attackers, which required sheering towards the shore and getting closer to it than they would have liked. However, they also wanted to avoid anchoring in deep water and make sure they were not near any rafts that might be in the lake.&#10;4. The intense darkness that prevailed so close to the forest served as an effective screen, but they still needed to be careful not to make any noise that could give away their position.&#10;5. The fact that they could not see the ark from the canoe, as it was completely buried in the shadows of the shore.&#10;&#10;These discoveries led Deerslayer and Chingachgook to be more cautious and take additional measures to ensure their safety as they approached the rendezvous point." />
    <node id=" tale&#10;    Of visionary hours.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Wordsworth.&#10;&#10;One discovery mentioned at the close of the preceding chapter was of&#10;great moment in the eyes of Deerslayer and his friend. In the first&#10;place, there was the danger, almost the certainty, that Hutter and Hurry&#10;would make a fresh attempt on this camp, should they awake and ascertain&#10;its position. Then there was the increased risk of landing to bring off&#10;Hist; and there were the general uncertainty and additional hazards that&#10;must follow from the circumstance that their enemies had begun to change&#10;their positions. As the Delaware was aware that the hour was near when&#10;he ought to repair to the rendezvous, he no longer thought of trophies&#10;torn from his foes, and one of the first things arranged between him and&#10;his associate was to permit the two others to sleep on, lest they should&#10;disturb the execution of their plans by substituting some of their own.&#10;The ark moved slowly, and it would have taken fully a quarter of an hour&#10;to reach the point, at the rate at which they were going, thus affording&#10;time for a little forethought. The Indians, in the wish to conceal their&#10;fire from" />
    <node id="Deerslayer waited a little to make certain that he had at last&#10;gained the desired position, when he gave the signal agreed on, and&#10;Chingachgook let go the grapnel and lowered the sail.&#10;&#10;The situation in which the ark now lay had its advantages and its&#10;disadvantages. The fire had been hid by sheering towards the shore, and&#10;the latter was nearer, perhaps, than was desirable. Still, the water&#10;was known to be very deep further off in the lake, and anchoring in deep&#10;water, under the circumstances in which the party was placed, was to&#10;be avoided, if possible. It was also believed no raft could be within&#10;miles; and though the trees in the darkness appeared almost to overhang&#10;the scow, it would not be easy to get off to her without using a boat.&#10;The intense darkness that prevailed so close in with the forest, too,&#10;served as an effectual screen, and so long as care was had not to make a&#10;noise, there was little or no danger of being detected. All these things&#10;Deerslayer pointed out to Judith, instructing her as to the course she&#10;was to follow in the event" />
    <node id=" the fact that nothing was&#10;in motion. As for the ark, though scarcely farther from the canoe than&#10;the point, it lay so completely buried in the shadows of the shore, that&#10;it would not have been visible even had there been many degrees more of&#10;light than actually existed.&#10;&#10;The adventurers now held a conference in low voices, consulting together&#10;as to the probable time. Deerslayer thought it wanted yet some minutes&#10;to the rising of the star, while the impatience of the chief caused him&#10;to fancy the night further advanced, and to believe that his betrothed&#10;was already waiting his appearance on the shore. As might have been&#10;expected, the opinion of the latter prevailed, and his friend disposed&#10;himself to steer for the place of rendezvous. The utmost skill and&#10;precaution now became necessary in the management of the canoe. The&#10;paddles were lifted and returned to the water in a noiseless manner;&#10;and when within a hundred yards of the beach, Chingachgook took in his,&#10;altogether laying his hand on his rifle in its stead. As they got still&#10;more within the belt of darkness that girded the woods, it was seen&#10;that" />
    <node id=" It is possible&#10;some serious consequences might have occurred, had not the Delaware&#10;interfered to remind them of the danger of being so unguarded, and of&#10;the necessity of returning to the ark. This checked the dispute, and in&#10;a few minutes they were paddling sullenly back to the spot where they&#10;hoped to find that vessel.&#10;&#10;It has been said that Judith took her place at the side of Deerslayer,&#10;soon after the adventurers departed. For a short time the girl was&#10;silent, and the hunter was ignorant which of the sisters had approached&#10;him, but he soon recognized the rich, full-spirited voice of the elder,&#10;as her feelings escaped in words.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is a terrible life for women, Deerslayer!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Would&#10;to Heaven I could see an end of it!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The life is well enough, Judith,&quot; was the answer, &quot;being pretty much as&#10;it is used or abused. What would you wish to see in its place?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I should be a thousand times happier to live nearer to civilized&#10;beings--where there are farms and churches, and houses built as it might&#10;be by Christian" />
    <node id=" his hand on his rifle in its stead. As they got still&#10;more within the belt of darkness that girded the woods, it was seen&#10;that they were steering too far north, and the course was altered&#10;accordingly. The canoe now seemed to move by instinct, so cautious and&#10;deliberate were all its motions. Still it continued to advance, until&#10;its bows grated on the gravel of the beach, at the precise spot where&#10;Hetty had landed, and whence her voice had issued, the previous night,&#10;as the ark was passing. There was, as usual, a narrow strand, but bushes&#10;fringed the woods, and in most places overhung the water.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook stepped upon the beach, and cautiously examined it for some&#10;distance on each side of the canoe. In order to do this, he was often&#10;obliged to wade to his knees in the lake, but no Hist rewarded his&#10;search. When he returned, he found his friend also on the shore. They&#10;next conferred in whispers, the Indian apprehending that they must have&#10;mistaken the place of rendezvous. But Deerslayer thought it was probable&#10;they had mistaken the hour" />
    <node id="When the hunter, who is attempting to capture a Native American woman on behalf of his companion, realizes that she is trying to alert the camp by making noise, he becomes agitated and decides it is time for him to retreat. He trips her up, giving her throat a final squeeze out of resentment for her efforts to sound the alarm, and then leaves her on the ground as he moves towards the bushes with his rifle at the ready. His actions are those of a cornered animal, with his head over his shoulders like a lion at bay, reflecting his wariness and readiness to defend himself if necessary. The narrative suggests that the hunter is concerned about being discovered by the warriors who have been roused by the woman's cries, and is taking precautions to avoid being caught in the open." />
    <node id=" breath,&#10;however, were well improved, and the hag succeeded in letting out a&#10;screech or two that served to alarm the camp. The tramp of the warriors,&#10;as they sprang from the fire, was plainly audible, and at the next&#10;moment three or four of them appeared on the top of the ridge, drawn&#10;against the background of light, resembling the dim shadows of the&#10;phantasmagoria. It was now quite time for the hunter to retreat.&#10;Tripping up the heels of his captive, and giving her throat a parting&#10;squeeze, quite as much in resentment at her indomitable efforts to sound&#10;the alarm as from any policy, he left her on her back, and moved towards&#10;the bushes, his rifle at a poise, and his head over his shoulders, like&#10;a lion at bay.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

With this understanding, then, the parties separated.&#10;&#10;As soon as Deerslayer was at his post again, in the stern of the canoe,&#10;he left the shore with the same precautions, and in the same noiseless&#10;manner, as he had approached it. On this occasion he did not go far from&#10;the land, the bushes affording a sufficient cover, by keeping as close&#10;in as possible. Indeed, it would not have been easy to devise any means&#10;more favourable to reconnoitering round an Indian camp, than those&#10;afforded by the actual state of things. The formation of the point&#10;permitted the place to be circled on three of its sides, and the&#10;progress of the boat was so noiseless as to remove any apprehensions&#10;from an alarm through sound. The most practised and guarded foot might&#10;stir a bunch of leaves, or snap a dried stick in the dark, but a bark&#10;canoe could be made to float over the surface of smooth water, almost&#10;with the instinctive readiness, and certainly with the noiseless&#10;movements of an aquatic bird" />

The gourd was filled, and the&#10;old woman was hurrying back, her hand still grasping the wrist of the&#10;girl, when she was suddenly seized so violently by the throat as to&#10;cause her to release her captive, and to prevent her making any other&#10;sound than a sort of gurgling, suffocating noise. The Serpent passed his&#10;arm round the waist of his mistress and dashed through the bushes with&#10;her, on the north side of the point. Here he immediately turned along&#10;the beach and ran towards the canoe. A more direct course could have&#10;been taken, but it might have led to a discovery of the place of&#10;embarking.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer kept playing on the throat of the old woman like the keys of&#10;an organ, occasionally allowing her to breathe, and then compressing&#10;his fingers again nearly to strangling. The brief intervals for breath,&#10;however, were well improved, and the hag succeeded in letting out a&#10;screech or two that served to alarm the camp." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer believes that churches are not necessary for people's happiness and views them as contradictions when they coexist with forts because he sees forts as being for protection against enemies, while churches are for peace. He thinks that all of nature can be a temple of the Lord, and one does not need a church building to connect with God. Furthermore, Deerslayer suggests that forts can sometimes hold their own enemies, possibly referring to conflicts and power struggles within communities. He also mentions that farms and churches are not as beneficial as people might think, and they may miss out on the natural beauty and resources that wilderness provides." />
    <node id=" as to churches, they are good, I suppose, else wouldn't&#10;good men uphold 'em. But they are not altogether necessary.

Moreover, all is contradiction in&#10;the settlements, while all is concord in the woods. Forts and churches&#10;almost always go together, and yet they're downright contradictions;&#10;churches being for peace, and forts for war.

If&#10;forts are good to keep off inimies, they sometimes hold inimies of their&#10;own. I don't think 'twould be for your good, or the good of Hetty, to&#10;live near one; and if I must say what I think, I'm afeard you are&#10;a little too near as it is.&quot; Deerslayer went on, in his own steady,&#10;earnest manner, for the darkness concealed the tints that colored the&#10;cheeks of the girl almost to the brightness of crimson, while her own&#10;great efforts suppressed the sounds of the breathing that nearly choked&#10;her. &quot;As for farms, they have their uses, and there's them that like&#10;to pass their lives on 'em; but what comfort can a man" />

    <node id="At stake for the two adventurers, an Indian named Chingachgook and his companion Deerslayer, in their first real encounter with the enemy is the success of their mission to rescue a captive named Hist from her Huron betrothed. This mission is significant as it is effectively the maiden expedition of these two ambitious young forest soldiers, who are determined to prove their worth and honor. A failure in this endeavor would not only mean the continued captivity of Hist but also a blow to their pride and manhood.

From the instant they left the side of the ark, the movements&#10;of the two adventurers were like the manoeuvres of highly-drilled&#10;soldiers, who, for the first time were called on to meet the enemy in&#10;the field. As yet, Chingachgook had never fired a shot in anger, and the&#10;debut of his companion in warfare is known to the reader. It is true,&#10;the Indian had been hanging about his enemy's camp for a few hours, on&#10;his first arrival, and he had even once entered it, as related in the&#10;last chapter, but no consequences had followed either experiment.&#10;Now, it was certain that an important result was to be effected, or a&#10;mortifying failure was to ensue. The rescue, or the continued captivity&#10;of Hist, depended on the enterprise.

    <node id="In the given text, Deerslayer executed &quot;little maneuvers&quot; with the scow, varying its direction to the right and left, in an attempt to shut in the Indians' fire near the southern side of the point. He did this so that the fire would not be visible to those who were thought to be still in the castle, and their approach from this quarter would come as an unexpected event. This maneuver was successful, as Deerslayer was able to conceal the fire behind bushes, making it impossible for anyone to see it from the water.&#10;&#10;According to Deerslayer's statement, this maneuver had the advantage of making the Mingos believe that they were still in the hut. By approaching from an unexpected direction, they could gain a strategic advantage over the Indians. This plan was favorable for Deerslayer and his companion as it allowed them to secretly advance towards the Indians without being detected." />

The Indians, in the wish to conceal their&#10;fire from those who were thought to be still in the castle, had placed&#10;it so near the southern side of the point as to render it extremely&#10;difficult to shut it in by the bushes, though Deerslayer varied the&#10;direction of the scow both to the right and to the left, in the hope of&#10;being able to effect that object.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's one advantage, Judith, in finding that fire so near the water,&quot;&#10;he said, while executing these little manoeuvres, &quot;since it shows&#10;the Mingos believe we are in the hut, and our coming on 'em from this&#10;quarter will be an unlooked for event. But it's lucky Harry March and&#10;your father are asleep, else we should have 'em prowling after scalps&#10;ag'in. Ha! there--the bushes are beginning to shut in the fire--and now&#10;it can't be seen at all!&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer waited a little to make certain that he had at last&#10;gained the desired position, when he gave the signal agreed on, and&#10;C" />

It prevented the light of the fire diffusing itself on&#10;the ground directly in the rear, although the land fell away towards the&#10;water, so as to leave what might be termed the left, or eastern flank&#10;of the position unprotected by this covering. We have said unprotected,&#10;though that is not properly the word, since the knoll behind the&#10;huts and the fire offered a cover for those who were now stealthily&#10;approaching, rather than any protection to the Indians. Deerslayer did&#10;not break through the fringe of bushes immediately abreast of the canoe,&#10;which might have brought him too suddenly within the influence of the&#10;light, since the hillock did not extend to the water; but he followed&#10;the beach northerly until he had got nearly on the opposite side of&#10;the tongue of land, which brought him under the shelter of the low&#10;acclivity, and consequently more in the shadow.&#10;&#10;As soon as the friends emerged from the bushes, they stopped to&#10;reconnoitre.

But even Hurry was awed by the stern composure of the chief,&#10;and he, too, knew that such a man was not to be outraged with impunity;&#10;he therefore turned to vent his rage on Deerslayer, where he foresaw no&#10;consequences so terrible.

It was the stern,&#10;resolute eye of the latter, rather than the noisy vehemence of the&#10;first, that excited her apprehensions. Hurry soon reached the spot where&#10;the canoe was fastened, but not before Deerslayer had spoken in a quick,&#10;earnest voice to the Serpent, in Delaware. The latter had been the&#10;first, in truth, to hear the sounds of the oars, and he had gone upon&#10;the platform in jealous watchfulness. The light satisfied him that a&#10;message was coming, and when the boy cast his bundle of sticks at his&#10;feet, it neither moved his anger nor induced surprise. He merely stood&#10;at watch, rifle in hand, to make certain that no treachery lay behind&#10;the defiance. As Deerslayer now called to him, he stepped into the&#10;canoe, and quick as thought removed the paddles. Hurry was furious&#10;when he found that he was deprived of the means of proceeding. He first&#10;approached the Indian with loud menaces, and even Deerslayer stood&#10;aghast" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer believes that it is wrong to &quot;mix colors&quot; in romantic relationships, indicating his opposition to interracial relationships. He holds this view despite acknowledging that both men and women have natural feelings of concern for their loved ones, which crosses racial boundaries.&#10;&#10;Judith, on the other hand, does not explicitly state her views on interracial relationships. However, she expresses her admiration for Deerslayer's commitment to his principles and acknowledges that he feels as a &quot;white man should&quot; in this regard.&#10;&#10;Regarding taking risks for loved ones, both Deerslayer and Judith recognize the importance of protecting those they care about. Deerslayer believes that it is a man's responsibility to protect women, who are considered weaker and more vulnerable. He is willing to take risks to save Hist, even if he is not betrothed to her.&#10;&#10;Judith, too, shows concern for Deerslayer's safety and wishes him not to take unnecessary risks. She recognizes that the mission to rescue Hist is dangerous and expresses her admiration for Deerslayer's commitment to it.

Nor&#10;do I suppose even you, unmoved and calm as you ever seem to be, could be&#10;at peace if you believed your Hist in danger.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a different matter--'tis altogether a different matter, Judith.&#10;Woman is too weak and gentle to be intended to run such risks, and man&#10;must feel for her.

    <node id="1. The young men hid their canoe in such a way that it would be visible to Hist if she arrived at the meeting place before them. This was done so that she would not be alarmed or think they had stood her up.&#10;2. They prepared their weapons and entered the woods, circling around the point of land that jutted into the lake.&#10;3. They were cautious to avoid making any noise that might give away their position, as the intense darkness near the forest served as an effective screen but also increased the risk of being heard.&#10;4. Deerslayer left Chingachgook in the canoe while he circled around the Indian camp, taking advantage of the noiselessness of the bark canoe to avoid detection.&#10;5. They discussed their plans and conjectures for why Hist had not yet arrived with great attention to detail, demonstrating their zealous concern for her safety." />
    <node id=" he had not stirred, fearful that his betrothed&#10;might arrive during his absence. A conference followed, in which&#10;Chingachgook was made acquainted with the state of things in the camp.&#10;When Hist named the point as the place of meeting, it was with the&#10;expectation of making her escape from the old position, and of repairing&#10;to a spot that she expected to find without any occupants; but the&#10;sudden change of localities had disconcerted all her plans. A much&#10;greater degree of vigilance than had been previously required was now&#10;necessary; and the circumstance that an aged woman was on watch also&#10;denoted some special grounds of alarm. All these considerations, and&#10;many more that will readily suggest themselves to the reader, were&#10;briefly discussed before the young men came to any decision. The&#10;occasion, however, being one that required acts instead of words, the&#10;course to be pursued was soon chosen.&#10;&#10;Disposing of the canoe in such a manner that Hist must see it, should&#10;she come to the place of meeting previously to their return, the young&#10;men looked to their arms and prepared to enter the wood.

    <node id="At stake for Chingachgook and his companion, referred to as Deerslayer, is the success of their first real encounter with the enemy and the rescue of Hist from her Huron betrothed.

A failure in this endeavor would not only mean the continued captivity of Hist but also a blow to their pride and manhood.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook's personal sentiments and feelings of pride play a role in his actions during the mission. This is demonstrated by his careful and deliberate approach to reconnaitre the interior of a nearby hut, which is described as being similar to the wily advances of a cat on a bird. He moves stealthily and quietly, making himself as small and inconspicuous as possible in order to avoid detection by the enemies inside the hut. This careful approach allows Chingachgook to gather information about the layout and occupants of the hut without putting himself in unnecessary danger.&#10;&#10;Similarly, Deerslayer's feelings of pride are also at play during the mission. He sets forth impelled by sentiments that usually carry men so far, showing his concern for Hist's safety and his determination to rescue her from captivity.&#10;&#10;Overall, both Chingachgook and Deerslayer have a lot at stake during this mission, as its success or failure will greatly impact their pride and manhood. Their personal sentiments and feelings of pride influence their actions and decisions throughout the mission, and they approach the task with coolness and method, demonstrating their determination and ambition." />
    <node id=" though in the present instance she was&#10;far more actuated by impulses, in all she had said and done, than by&#10;calculation. We shall not deny that some of Judith's reflections were&#10;bitter, though the sequel of the tale must be referred to, in order to&#10;explain how merited, or how keen were her sufferings.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook and his pale-face friend set forth on their hazardous and&#10;delicate enterprise, with a coolness and method that would have done&#10;credit to men who were on their twentieth, instead of being on their&#10;first, war-path. As suited his relation to the pretty fugitive, in whose&#10;service they were engaged, the Indian took his place in the head of&#10;the canoe; while Deerslayer guided its movements in the stern. By this&#10;arrangement, the former would be the first to land, and of course,&#10;the first to meet his mistress. The latter had taken his post without&#10;comment, but in secret influenced by the reflection that one who had so&#10;much at stake as the Indian, might not possibly guide the canoe with the&#10;same steadiness and intelligence, as another who had more command of his&#10;feelings.

    <node id="Yes, it is possible that Hurry Harry's actions are driven more by jealousy and a desire to win Judith's favor rather than malice. Throughout the narrative, there are indications that Harry's behavior towards Judith stems from his strong feelings for her. For example, he wants to make her his wife, and some of the negative things he says about her may be due to his frustration and disappointment at not being able to win her over. However, it is also possible that he is intentionally trying to tarnish her reputation to lower her standing in the eyes of other suitors and increase his chances of winning her favor. Ultimately, the narrative does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about Harry's motivations." />

    <node id="Summary:&#10;Deerslayer is willing to risk his life and liberty to rescue Hist, the Sarpent's betrothed, because he believes in upholding his duty as a friend and protecting those who are vulnerable. Although he does not have romantic feelings for Hist, he acknowledges that natural feelings of concern for loved ones transcend racial boundaries.&#10;&#10;In response to Judith's question, Deerslayer explains that it would not be appropriate to abandon an ally in need, especially during a dangerous mission like this one. He also argues that having a friend with him can increase the likelihood of success, as they can work together to overcome obstacles and protect each other.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's opposition to interracial relationships is evident when he states that he believes it is wrong to &quot;mix colors&quot; in romantic relationships. However, he acknowledges that both men and women have natural feelings of concern for their loved ones, which cross racial boundaries.&#10;&#10;Judith expresses admiration for Deerslayer's commitment to his principles and recognizes that even someone as seemingly calm and unmoved as him would feel concern for his loved ones in danger. She also acknowledges that the mission to rescue Hist is dangerous and expresses her wish that he not take unnecessary risks.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Deerslayer's motivation for risking his life and liberty to bring Hist to the Sarpent is rooted in his sense of duty as a friend and protector, as well as his recognition that natural feelings of concern for loved ones transcend racial boundaries. Judith's admiration for Deerslayer's commitment to his principles suggests that she values his steadfastness and integrity." />

    <node id="The tension between Hurry and Deerslayer is being caused by their disagreement over how to handle the creature they encountered in the woods. Specifically, Hurry wants to track and kill the creature, while Deerslayer believes that it has already left and there is no need to pursue it further. Judith is trembling at the prospect of a violent scene between them because Hurry has become increasingly aggressive and overbearing, whereas Deerslayer remains calm and determined in his convictions. She recognizes the potential for serious consequences if they do not resolve their dispute peacefully, which prompts her to intervene and remind them of the danger of being unguarded in the woods at night.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there may be underlying tensions between Hurry and Deerslayer due to Hurry's romantic interest in Judith, who shows a preference for Deerslayer's calm and principled demeanor over Hurry's impulsive and aggressive behavior.

This decision was made in response to the increased risk posed by the enemies building rafts and their confidence in attacking the castle.&#10;2. They secured the castle, withdrew the canoes from the dock, and fastened them to the ark. Necessary items were transferred to the cabin, and the fire was extinguished before embarking.&#10;3. The darkness of the night had an impact on their visibility while embarking on the ark. Although the island or castle stood in a belt of comparative light, it was still dark enough to cover the aperture of the ark. An observer on the shore would not be able to see the ark's movements due to the background of dark hillside filling up the perspective of any diagonal or direct view across the water.&#10;4. Deerslayer and Chingachgook hid their canoe in such a way that it would be visible to Hist if she arrived at the meeting place before them, preventing any alarm or concern on her part. They also prepared their weapons and entered the woods, circling around the point of land jutting into the lake while being cautious not to make any noise that might reveal their position.&#10;5. The intense darkness near the forest served as an effective screen, but they still needed to avoid making any sounds that could give away their position. Deerslayer left Chingachgook in the canoe while he circled around the Indian camp, taking advantage of the noiselessness of the bark canoe to avoid detection.&#10;6.

A few minutes sufficed, however, to carry the canoe the necessary&#10;distance, when both the young men ceased paddling as it were by&#10;instinctive consent, and the boat became stationary. The darkness&#10;increased rather than diminished, but it was still possible, from the&#10;place where the adventurers lay, to distinguish the outlines of the&#10;mountains. In vain did the Delaware turn his head eastward, to catch a&#10;glimpse of the promised star; for, notwithstanding the clouds broke&#10;a little near the horizon in that quarter of the heavens, the curtain&#10;continued so far drawn as effectually to conceal all behind it.

No signs of the&#10;castle could be seen, nor could any movement in that quarter of the lake&#10;reach the ear.

Here he assembled the whole party, and&#10;communicated as much of his intentions as he deemed expedient. Of the&#10;arrangement made by Deerslayer, to abandon the castle during the night&#10;and to take refuge in the ark, he entirely approved. It struck him as it&#10;had the others, as the only effectual means of escaping destruction.&#10;Now that the savages had turned their attention to the construction of&#10;rafts, no doubt could exist of their at least making an attempt to carry&#10;the building, and the message of the bloody sticks sufficiently showed&#10;their confidence in their own success. In short, the old man viewed&#10;the night as critical, and he called on all to get ready as soon as&#10;possible, in order to abandon the dwellings temporarily at least, if not&#10;forever.&#10;&#10;These communications made, everything proceeded promptly and with&#10;intelligence; the castle was secured" />
    <node id="According to Deerslayer in the narrative, churches are not considered necessary for people's happiness because he believes that one can connect with God and find peace in nature itself. He sees churches as contradictions when they coexist with forts, which are meant for protection against enemies, because churches are supposed to be for peace. Deerslayer suggests that the wilderness can be a temple of the Lord, and the &quot;strong places&quot; of the wilderness, such as trees, and arbors raised by nature, are preferable to churches.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's perspective on churches and forts is influenced by his belief in the natural order of things. He sees forts as necessary for protection against enemies, but he also recognizes that they can sometimes hold their own enemies, possibly referring to conflicts and power struggles within communities. He sees farms and churches as non-essential and potentially even detrimental to one's connection with nature.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Deerslayer believes that the wilderness provides natural beauty and resources that are not available in settled areas with farms and churches. He values the shades, laughing springs, leaping brooks, and venerable trees found in the forest, which he sees as superior to the disabled trunks in a clearing.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer's perspective on churches is influenced by his belief that one can find peace and connect with God in nature, and his preference for the wilderness over settled areas.

    <node id="In the given text, Deerslayer took several steps to ensure a stealthy approach with his companion towards the fire. First, he executed &quot;little maneuvers&quot; with the scow, varying its direction to the right and left, to shut in the Indians' fire near the southern side of the point. This maneuver was successful in concealing the fire behind bushes, making it impossible for anyone to see it from the water. By approaching from an unexpected direction, they could gain a strategic advantage over the Indians and prevent the light of the fire from diffusing itself on the ground directly in the rear. Deerslayer also followed the beach northerly until he had got nearly on the opposite side of the tongue of land, which brought him under the shelter of a low acclivity and consequently more in the shadow.&#10;&#10;The placement of the fire affected their strategy by leaving the left, or eastern flank of their position unprotected by covering. However, the knoll behind the huts and the fire offered cover for those who were now stealthily approaching, rather than any protection to the Indians. By circling the point in the canoe and getting a position close in, where the camp could be seen, Deerslayer aimed to reconnoiter the Indians and form plausible conjectures for the non-appearance of Hist." />
    <node id="Hist had not yet been able to come to the place of meeting with Deerslayer because she was being watched by an old woman, who had been assigned by the chiefs to perform a duty that likely involved keeping an eye on Hist. This duty is mentioned as being commonly given to older women among the Delawares.&#10;&#10;The old hag, or &quot;hag&quot; as she is referred to in the narrative, was seated apart from the other women and children, with a watchful and soured aspect that suggested she had been assigned an unpleasant task. Deerslayer, the main character, recognized this behavior and knew that it must be connected to her role as a watcher.&#10;&#10;Hist, on the other hand, was expected to sleep in a small hut or bower near where she stood, with the old hag stretched across the entrance as was her nightly practice. This made it difficult for Hist to escape and meet Deerslayer, but luckily, the old hag was called away to get water, giving Hist and Deerslayer a brief window of opportunity to meet." />

Who has ever heard the name of a young&#10;Delaware warrior?&quot;&#10;&#10;This was said in good-humour, and with a laugh; but it was also said&#10;bitingly. That Hist so felt it, was apparent by the spirit betrayed in&#10;her answer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who has ever heard the name of a young Delaware?&quot; she repeated&#10;earnestly. &quot;Tamenund, himself, though now as old as the pines on the&#10;hill, or as the eagles in the air, was once young; his name was heard&#10;from the great salt lake to the sweet waters of the west.

This Deerslayer well&#10;knew, and it was one of the reasons why he had selected this particular&#10;tree.&#10;&#10;The moment was near when it became necessary for Hist to act. She was&#10;to sleep in a small hut, or bower, that had been built near where she&#10;stood, and her companion was the aged hag already mentioned. Once within&#10;the hut, with this sleepless old woman stretched across the entrance, as&#10;was her nightly practice, the hope of escape was nearly destroyed, and&#10;she might at any moment be summoned to her bed. Luckily, at this instant&#10;one of the warriors called to the old woman by name, and bade her bring&#10;him water to drink. There was a delicious spring on the northern side of&#10;the point, and the hag took a gourd from a branch and, summoning Hist&#10;to her side, she moved towards the summit of the ridge, intending to&#10;descend and cross the point to the natural fountain. All this was&#10;seen and understood by the adventurers, and they fell back into the&#10;obscurity, concealing their persons by trees, until the two females had&#10;passed them. In walking," />

Deerslayer traced her uneasiness&#10;by her attempting once or twice to look up through the branches of the&#10;trees, as if endeavouring to get glimpses of the star she had herself&#10;named as the sign for meeting. All was vain, however, and after&#10;strolling about the camp a little longer, in affected indifference, the&#10;two girls quitted their male escort, and took seats among their own sex.&#10;As soon as this was done, the old sentinel changed her place to one&#10;more agreeable to herself, a certain proof that she had hitherto been&#10;exclusively on watch.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer now felt greatly at a loss how to proceed. He well knew&#10;that Chingachgook could never be persuaded to return to the ark without&#10;making some desperate effort for the recovery of his mistress, and his&#10;own generous feelings well disposed him to aid in such an undertaking.&#10;He thought he saw the signs of an intention among the females to retire&#10;for the night; and should he remain, and the fire continue to give out&#10;its light, he might discover the particular hut or arbour under which" />

The additional chances&#10;of success, however, had their place in the formation of the second&#10;enterprise. It was known that a large portion of the warriors--perhaps&#10;all--were encamped for the night abreast of the castle, and it was hoped&#10;that the scalps of helpless victims would be the consequence. To confess&#10;the truth, Hutter in particular--he who had just left two daughters&#10;behind him--expected to find few besides women and children in the camp.&#10;The fact had been but slightly alluded to in his communications with&#10;Hurry, and with Chingachgook it had been kept entirely out of view. If&#10;the Indian thought of it at all, it was known only to himself.&#10;&#10;Hutter steered the canoe; Hurry had manfully taken his post in the bows,&#10;and Chingachgook stood in the centre.

However, she is held back by her natural modesty and does not explicitly express her love for him. Instead, she acknowledges his good qualities and compares him favorably to Hurry Harry, who also has romantic feelings towards her. Judith's preference for Deerslayer's calm and principled demeanor over Hurry's impulsive and aggressive behavior further suggests her attraction to the former.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when Deerslayer is about to embark on a dangerous mission to rescue Hist, Judith expresses her concern for his safety and wishes him not to take unnecessary risks. She acknowledges that the mission is perilous and admires Deerslayer's commitment to it, indicating a shared understanding of the importance of protecting those they care about.&#10;&#10;Overall, Judith's actions and the narrator's description of her suggest that she has strong feelings of affection towards Deerslayer and views him favorably compared to Hurry Harry. However, her natural modesty prevents her from explicitly expressing her love for him." />
    <node id="The uncertainty for Hutter and Chingachgook in determining the direction of the wind is caused by the prevailing west wind being disrupted by the mountains in the region, resulting in unpredictable currents that vary within short distances and brief differences of time. This is especially true for light fluctuating puffs of air, making it difficult for them to tell which way the wind is blowing. Additionally, the lack of visible openings in the mass of gloomy clouds overhead makes it impossible for them to use the clouds as an indicator of wind direction." />
    <node id="background of dark hillside filled up the perspective of every view that&#10;was taken diagonally or directly across the water. The prevailing wind&#10;on the lakes of that region is west, but owing to the avenues formed by&#10;the mountains it is frequently impossible to tell the true direction&#10;of the currents, as they often vary within short distances and brief&#10;differences of time. This is truer in light fluctuating puffs of air&#10;than in steady breezes; though the squalls of even the latter are&#10;familiarly known to be uncertain and baffling in all mountainous regions&#10;and narrow waters. On the present occasion, Hutter himself (as he shoved&#10;the ark from her berth at the side of the platform) was at a loss to&#10;pronounce which way the wind blew. In common, this difficulty was solved&#10;by the clouds, which, floating high above the hill tops, as a matter of&#10;course obeyed the currents; but now the whole vault of heaven seemed&#10;a mass of gloomy wall. Not an opening of any sort was visible, and&#10;Chingachgook was already trembling lest the non-appearance of the star&#10;might prevent his betrothed from being punctual to her appointment.&#10;" />

The air soon filled the cloth,&#10;and when the scow was got under command, and the sail was properly&#10;trimmed, it was found that the direction was southerly, inclining&#10;towards the eastern shore. No better course offering for the purposes&#10;of the party, the singular craft was suffered to skim the surface of&#10;the water in this direction for more than hour, when a change in the&#10;currents of the air drove them over towards the camp.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer watched all the movements of Hutter and Harry with jealous&#10;attention. At first, he did not know whether to ascribe the course they&#10;held to accident or to design; but he now began to suspect the latter.&#10;Familiar as Hutter was with the lake, it was easy to deceive one who had&#10;little practice on the water; and let his intentions be what they&#10;might" />

In consequence of their recent change&#10;of ground, the Indians had not yet retired to their huts, but had been&#10;delayed by their preparations, which included lodging as well as food.&#10;A large fire had been made, as much to answer the purpose of torches as&#10;for the use of their simple cookery; and at this precise moment it was&#10;blazing high and bright, having recently received a large supply of&#10;dried brush. The effect was to illuminate the arches of the forest, and&#10;to render the whole area occupied by the camp as light as if hundreds of&#10;tapers were burning.

In order,&#10;however, to protect themselves against any straggler in the rear, they&#10;placed their bodies against the trunk of an oak, standing on the side&#10;next the fire.&#10;&#10;The view that Deerslayer now obtained of the camp was exactly the&#10;reverse of that he had perceived from the water. The dim figures which&#10;he had formerly discovered must have been on the summit of the ridge,&#10;a few feet in advance of the spot where he was now posted. The fire&#10;was still blazing brightly, and around it were seated on logs thirteen&#10;warriors, which accounted for all whom he had seen from the canoe.

    <node id="Deerslayer discusses several precautions with Judith regarding the danger of being detected as they plan to rescue Hist from the Huron camp.

It is important for them to understand each other before he and Hist leave in the canoe because they are about to embark on a dangerous mission, and Deerslayer wants to ensure that Judith knows how to react in case of an emergency.

All these things&#10;Deerslayer pointed out to Judith, instructing her as to the course she&#10;was to follow in the event of an alarm; for it was thought to the last&#10;degree inexpedient to arouse the sleepers, unless it might be in the&#10;greatest emergency.&#10;&#10;&quot;And now, Judith, as we understand one another, it is time the Sarpent&#10;and I had taken to the canoe,&quot; the hunter concluded. &quot;The star has not&#10;risen yet, it's true, but it soon must, though none of us are likely&#10;to be any the wiser for it to-night, on account of the clouds.

I'll warrant you she'll not be either&#10;two minutes or two feet out of the way, unless them jealous vagabonds,&#10;the Mingos, have taken the alarm, and put her as a stool-pigeon to&#10;catch us, or have hid her away, in order to prepare her mind for a Huron&#10;instead of a Mohican husband.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;De" />
    <node id="Deerslayer is left alone on the ark because Hutter, Hurry (March), and Chingachgook have taken the canoe to go after Huron scalps. They decided to do this after realizing that there was room for more scalps on Chingachgook's belt, which would show off their success to his people when he returns to his village. Deerslayer does not join them in this mission and stays behind on the ark, growing increasingly wary as he is left alone with his thoughts." />
    <node id=" as Hutter was with the lake, it was easy to deceive one who had&#10;little practice on the water; and let his intentions be what they&#10;might, it was evident, ere two hours had elapsed, that the ark had got&#10;sufficient space to be within a hundred rods of the shore, directly&#10;abreast of the known position of the camp. For a considerable time&#10;previously to reaching this point, Hurry, who had some knowledge of the&#10;Algonquin language, had been in close conference with the Indian, and&#10;the result was now announced by the latter to Deerslayer, who had been a&#10;cold, not to say distrusted, looker-on of all that passed.&#10;&#10;&quot;My old father, and my young brother, the Big Pine,&quot;--for so the&#10;Delaware had named March--&quot;want to see Huron scalps at their belts,&quot;&#10;said Chingachgook to his friend. &quot;There is room for some on the girdle&#10;of the Sarpent, and his people will look for them when he goes back to&#10;his village. Their eyes must not be left long in a fog, but they must&#10;see what they look for. I know" />
    <node id="ingachgook must hasten.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Indian then joined his two co-adventurers, and first lowering the&#10;sail, they all three entered the canoe, and left the side of the ark.&#10;Neither Hutter nor March spoke to Deerslayer concerning their object, or&#10;the probable length of their absence. All this had been confided to&#10;the Indian, who had acquitted himself of the trust with characteristic&#10;brevity. As soon as the canoe was out of sight, and that occurred&#10;ere the paddles had given a dozen strokes, Deerslayer made the best&#10;dispositions he could to keep the ark as nearly stationary as possible;&#10;and then he sat down in the end of the scow, to chew the cud of his own&#10;bitter reflections. It was not long, however, before he was joined by&#10;Judith, who sought every occasion to be near him, managing her attack on&#10;his affections with the address that was suggested by native coquetry,&#10;aided by no little practice, but which received much of its most&#10;dangerous power from the touch of feeling that threw around her manner,&#10;voice, accents, thoughts, and acts, the indesc" />
    <node id=" saying, Deerslayer turned away, like one resolved to waste no more&#10;words on the subject, while Hutter pulled Harry by the sleeve, and led&#10;him into the ark. There they sat long in private conference. In the&#10;mean time, the Indian and his friend had their secret consultation; for,&#10;though it wanted some three or four hours to the rising of the star, the&#10;former could not abstain from canvassing his scheme, and from opening&#10;his heart to the other. Judith, too, yielded to her softer feelings,&#10;and listened to the whole of Hetty's artless narrative of what occurred&#10;after she landed. The woods had few terrors for either of these girls,&#10;educated as they had been, and accustomed as they were to look out daily&#10;at their rich expanse or to wander beneath their dark shades; but the&#10;elder sister felt that she would have hesitated about thus venturing&#10;alone into an Iroquois camp. Concerning Hist, Hetty was not very&#10;communicative. She spoke of her kindness and gentleness and of the&#10;meeting in the forest; but the secret of Chingachgook was guarded with&#10;a shrewdness and fidelity that many" />
    <node id="The mood at the evening meal was one of relaxation and enjoyment, with the Native Americans engaging in leisure activities. Hurry March, however, was in a different mood. He had just returned from being held captive by the German family on the Mohawk, whom he had a great antipathy towards. He confounded them with the enemies of Judea and expressed his desire for revenge against them. Despite this, Hurry was also feeling wealthy and powerful after obtaining loot from his captors. He boasted about his success and even offered to pay as much for Rivenoak's scalp as the Colony. Overall, Hurry's behavior during the evening meal was hot-headed, impulsive, and fueled by a desire for revenge and wealth." />

Well, it's&#10;over, and syth's and lamentations won't mend the matter! There's the&#10;blackguard Rivenoak, he that brought us off has an oncommon scalp, and&#10;I'd give as much for it myself as the Colony.

    <node id="Hutter and Hurry, known for their ruthless treatment of Native Americans, were motivated by a combination of habitual contempt for the Hurons and unceasing greed for profit. They hoped to take advantage of the opportunity to find many Huron warriors, especially since they believed that most of them were encamped near the castle. Their primary goal was to acquire more scalps for Chingachgook's belt, which would demonstrate their success and increase their standing among his people. Additionally, Hutter personally expected to find few women or children in the camp.&#10;&#10;The underlying desire for both Hutter and Hurry was prodigality, driven by their need for gold and wealth. Although Hurry had initially felt angered after being freed from captivity, his love for gold quickly overshadowed this emotion, leading him to join Hutter in seeking profit through the acquisition of Huron scalps." />

Leaving the young hunter exposed to these dangerous&#10;assailants, it has become our more immediate business to follow the&#10;party in the canoe to the shore.&#10;&#10;The controlling influence that led Hutter and Hurry to repeat their&#10;experiment against the camp was precisely that which had induced the&#10;first attempt, a little heightened, perhaps, by the desire of revenge.&#10;But neither of these two rude beings, so ruthless in all things that&#10;touched the rights and interests of the red man, thought possessing&#10;veins of human feeling on other matters, was much actuated by any other&#10;desire than a heartless longing for profit. Hurry had felt angered at&#10;his sufferings, when first liberated, it is true, but that emotion&#10;soon disappeared in the habitual love of gold, which he sought with the&#10;reckless avidity of a needy spendthrift, rather than with the ceaseless&#10;longings of a miser.

He was&#10;mortified, and a little surprised, it is true; but he bore all with&#10;dignity, falling back for support on the sweeter expectations that still&#10;lay in reserve for that evening. It was true, he could not now hope to&#10;meet his mistress with the proofs of his daring and skill on his person,&#10;but he might still hope to meet her; and the warrior, who was zealous in&#10;the search, might always hope to be honored. On the other hand, Hutter&#10;and Hurry, who had been chiefly instigated by the basest of all human&#10;motives, the thirst of gain, could scarce control their feelings. They&#10;went prowling among the huts, as if they expected to find some forgotten&#10;child or careless sleeper; and again and again did they vent their spite&#10;on the insensible huts, several of which were actually torn to pieces,&#10;and scattered about the place. Nay, they even quarrelled with each&#10;other, and fierce reproaches passed between them. It is possible&#10;some serious consequences might have occurred, had not the Delaware&#10;interfered to remind them of the danger of being so unguarded," />

A short surly&#10;conference was held, when Hutter decided that the wisest way would be&#10;to keep in motion as the means most likely to defeat any attempt at a&#10;surprise--announcing his own and March's intention to requite themselves&#10;for the loss of sleep during their captivity, by lying down. As the air&#10;still baffled and continued light, it was finally determined to sail&#10;before it, let it come in what direction it might, so long as it did not&#10;blow the ark upon the strand. This point settled, the released prisoners&#10;helped to hoist the sail, and they threw themselves upon two of the&#10;pallets, leaving Deerslayer and his friend to look after the movements&#10;of the craft.

March's companions were able to return to the scow because Deerslayer had correctly assumed that they would not have drifted far from the scow with the sail down, and Chingachgook was able to guide Hutter back to it in a low canoe. Neither Hutter nor Hurry mentioned their captivity experience upon re-entering the scow, focusing instead on regaining their strength and keeping watch for any surprises." />

Hetty's newfound influence is due to the &quot;self-devotion and decision&quot; of her recent conduct, as well as possibly being helped by her established mental imbecility which may have removed any suspicion of a wish to control. This has earned her a sort of consideration that she had not enjoyed before.&#10;2. Hurry expresses his frustration to Hetty after losing six valuable skins by pouring out his discontent in her attentive ears. He compares the loss of the skins to being in a county gaol or a lack of beaver, and mentions that twenty strokes of a well-turned paddle would have overtaken them. He seems more upset about the value of the skins than any actual danger from the creature they were pursuing." />

He moves stealthily and quietly, making himself as small and inconspicuous as possible in order to avoid detection by the enemies inside the hut. This careful approach allows Chingachgook to gather information about the layout and occupants of the hut without putting himself in unnecessary danger.&#10;&#10;Similarly, Deerslayer's feelings of pride are also at play during the mission. He sets forth impelled by sentiments that usually carry men so far, showing his concern for Hist's safety and his determination to rescue her from captivity.&#10;&#10;Overall, both Chingachgook and Deerslayer have a lot at stake during this mission, as its success or failure will greatly impact their pride and manhood.

Specifically, Hurry wants to track and kill the creature, while Deerslayer believes that it has already left and there is no need to pursue it further.

He sees churches as contradictions when they coexist with forts, which are meant for protection against enemies, because churches are supposed to be for peace. Deerslayer suggests that the wilderness can be a temple of the Lord, and the &quot;strong places&quot; of the wilderness, such as trees, and arbors raised by nature, are preferable to churches.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's perspective on churches and forts is influenced by his belief in the natural order of things. He sees forts as necessary for protection against enemies, but he also recognizes that they can sometimes hold their own enemies, possibly referring to conflicts and power struggles within communities. He sees farms and churches as non-essential and potentially even detrimental to one's connection with nature.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Deerslayer believes that the wilderness provides natural beauty and resources that are not available in settled areas with farms and churches.

By doing so, they can minimize the risk of being detected and increase their chances of success.

Hurry March, however, was in a different mood. He had just returned from being held captive by the German family on the Mohawk, whom he had a great antipathy towards. He confounded them with the enemies of Judea and expressed his desire for revenge against them. Despite this, Hurry was also feeling wealthy and powerful after obtaining loot from his captors. He boasted about his success and even offered to pay as much for Rivenoak's scalp as the Colony.

A conference followed, in which&#10;Chingachgook was made acquainted with the state of things in the camp.&#10;When Hist named the point as the place of meeting, it was with the&#10;expectation of making her escape from the old position, and of repairing&#10;to a spot that she expected to find without any occupants; but the&#10;sudden change of localities had disconcerted all her plans. A much&#10;greater degree of vigilance than had been previously required was now&#10;necessary; and the circumstance that an aged woman was on watch also&#10;denoted some special grounds of alarm. All these considerations, and&#10;many more that will readily suggest themselves to the reader, were&#10;briefly discussed before the young men came to any decision. The&#10;occasion, however, being one that required acts instead of words, the&#10;course to be pursued was soon chosen.&#10;&#10;Disposing of the canoe in such a manner that Hist must see it, should&#10;she come to the place of meeting previously to their return, the young&#10;men looked to their arms and prepared to enter the wood.

Deerslayer, the main character, recognized this behavior and knew that it must be connected to her role as a watcher.&#10;&#10;Hist, on the other hand, was expected to sleep in a small hut or bower near where she stood, with the old hag stretched across the entrance as was her nightly practice. This made it difficult for Hist to escape and meet Deerslayer, but luckily, the old hag was called away to get water, giving Hist and Deerslayer a brief window of opportunity to meet.">

    <edge source="At stake for Chingachgook and his companion, referred to as Deerslayer, is the success of their first real encounter with the enemy and the rescue of Hist from her Huron betrothed. This mission is significant as it is effectively the maiden expedition of these two ambitious young forest soldiers, who are determined to prove their worth and honor. A failure in this endeavor would not only mean the continued captivity of Hist but also a blow to their pride and manhood.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook's personal sentiments and feelings of pride play a role in his actions during the mission. This is demonstrated by his careful and deliberate approach to reconnaitre the interior of a nearby hut, which is described as being similar to the wily advances of a cat on a bird. He moves stealthily and quietly, making himself as small and inconspicuous as possible in order to avoid detection by the enemies inside the hut. This careful approach allows Chingachgook to gather information about the layout and occupants of the hut without putting himself in unnecessary danger.&#10;&#10;Similarly, Deerslayer's feelings of pride are also at play during the mission. He sets forth impelled by sentiments that usually carry men so far, showing his concern for Hist's safety and his determination to rescue her from captivity.&#10;&#10;Overall, both Chingachgook and Deerslayer have a lot at stake during this mission, as its success or failure will greatly impact their pride and manhood. Their personal sentiments and feelings of pride influence their actions and decisions throughout the mission, and they approach the task with coolness and method, demonstrating their determination and ambition." target=" though in the present instance she was&#10;far more actuated by impulses, in all she had said and done, than by&#10;calculation.

He also argues that having a friend with him can increase the likelihood of success, as they can work together to overcome obstacles and protect each other.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's opposition to interracial relationships is evident when he states that he believes it is wrong to &quot;mix colors&quot; in romantic relationships. However, he acknowledges that both men and women have natural feelings of concern for their loved ones, which cross racial boundaries.&#10;&#10;Judith expresses admiration for Deerslayer's commitment to his principles and recognizes that even someone as seemingly calm and unmoved as him would feel concern for his loved ones in danger. She also acknowledges that the mission to rescue Hist is dangerous and expresses her wish that he not take unnecessary risks.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Deerslayer's motivation for risking his life and liberty to bring Hist to the Sarpent is rooted in his sense of duty as a friend and protector, as well as his recognition that natural feelings of concern for loved ones transcend racial boundaries. Judith's admiration for Deerslayer's commitment to his principles suggests that she values his steadfastness and integrity." target="The Deerslayer refused to kill the boy because he believed it was wrong to kill an unarmed and defenseless person. He operates according to a strict moral code that values fairness and honor in battle, and he did not see the boy as a legitimate target. This refusal to kill the boy went against March's own desire for revenge and his willingness to use violence to achieve his goals.

To kill the boy would have been disrespectful of this right and therefore unjustified in the Deerslayer's eyes.&#10;&#10;Overall, the Deerslayer refused to kill the boy because it went against his moral code and sense of fairness, as well as his respect for the law and individual rights.">

First, he executed &quot;little maneuvers&quot; with the scow, varying its direction to the right and left, to shut in the Indians' fire near the southern side of the point. This maneuver was successful in concealing the fire behind bushes, making it impossible for anyone to see it from the water. By approaching from an unexpected direction, they could gain a strategic advantage over the Indians and prevent the light of the fire from diffusing itself on the ground directly in the rear. Deerslayer also followed the beach northerly until he had got nearly on the opposite side of the tongue of land, which brought him under the shelter of a low acclivity and consequently more in the shadow.&#10;&#10;The placement of the fire affected their strategy by leaving the left, or eastern flank of their position unprotected by covering. However, the knoll behind the huts and the fire offered cover for those who were now stealthily approaching, rather than any protection to the Indians. By circling the point in the canoe and getting a position close in, where the camp could be seen, Deerslayer aimed to reconnoiter the Indians and form plausible conjectures for the non-appearance of Hist.">

This maneuver was successful in concealing the fire behind bushes, making it impossible for anyone to see it from the water.

The effect was to illuminate the arches of the forest, and&#10;to render the whole area occupied by the camp as light as if hundreds of&#10;tapers were burning. Most of the toil had ceased, and even the hungriest&#10;child had satisfied its appetite. In a word, the time was that moment of&#10;relaxation and general indolence which is apt to succeed a hearty&#10;meal, and when the labours of the day have ended. The hunters and&#10;the fishermen had been totally successful; and food, that one great&#10;requisite of savage life, being abundant, every other care appeared to&#10;have subsided in the sense of">

The fire&#10;was still blazing brightly, and around it were seated on logs thirteen&#10;warriors, which accounted for all whom he had seen from the canoe. They&#10;were conversing, with much earnestness among themselves, the image of&#10;the elephant passing from hand to hand.

    <node id="After the party vigorously paddles their canoe, they stop at a point where they can command an entire view of the northern shore of the island. They see two canoes and a smoke, which indicates the presence of their enemies, the Hurons or French. However, when Duncan looks in the direction pointed by the scout, he does not see anything but land and water. The scout then points out a mist rising above an islet, with an edging of blacker smoke hanging along its lower side, which is from a fire on the islet." />
    <node id=", making a hasty sign to repress his&#10;impatience; &quot;I am much of your mind myself; though I thought it becoming&#10;my experience to tell the whole. We must then make a push, and if the&#10;Indians or Frenchers are in the narrows, run the gauntlet through these&#10;toppling mountains. Is there reason in my words, Sagamore?&quot;&#10;&#10;The Indian made no other answer than by dropping his paddle into the&#10;water, and urging forward the canoe. As he held the office of directing&#10;its course, his resolution was sufficiently indicated by the movement.&#10;The whole party now plied their paddles vigorously, and in a very few&#10;moments they had reached a point whence they might command an entire&#10;view of the northern shore of the island, the side that had hitherto&#10;been concealed.&#10;&#10;&quot;There they are, by all the truth of signs,&quot; whispered the scout; &quot;two&#10;canoes and a smoke. The knaves haven't yet got their eyes out of the&#10;mist, or we should hear the accursed whoop. Together, friend! we are&#10;leaving them, and are already nearly out of whistle of a bullet.&quot;&#10;&#10;The well known crack" />
    <node id="&#10;much as the black head of a loon dotting the water.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Indian gravely raised his paddle, and pointed in the direction in&#10;which his own steady look was riveted. Duncan's eyes followed the&#10;motion. A few rods in their front lay another of the low wooded islets,&#10;but it appeared as calm and peaceful as if its solitude had never been&#10;disturbed by the foot of man.&#10;&#10;&quot;I see nothing,&quot; he said, &quot;but land and water; and a lovely scene it&#10;is.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hist!&quot; interrupted the scout. &quot;Ay, Sagamore, there is always a reason&#10;for what you do. 'Tis but a shade, and yet it is not natural. You see&#10;the mist, major, that is rising above the island; you can't call it a&#10;fog, for it is more like a streak of thin cloud--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is vapor from the water.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That a child could tell. But what is the edging of blacker smoke that&#10;hangs along its lower side, and which you may trace down into the&#10;thicket of hazel? 'Tis from a fire; but one that, in" />
    <node id=" close and deadly chase from which they had just relieved&#10;themselves, with as much coolness as though their speed had been tried&#10;in sport, rather than under such pressing, nay, almost desperate&#10;circumstances.&#10;&#10;Instead of following the western shore, whither their errand led them,&#10;the wary Mohican inclined his course more towards those hills behind&#10;which Montcalm was known to have led his army into the formidable&#10;fortress of Ticonderoga. As the Hurons, to every appearance, had&#10;abandoned the pursuit, there was no apparent reason for this excess of&#10;caution. It was, however, maintained for hours, until they had reached a&#10;bay, nigh the northern termination of the lake. Here the canoe was&#10;driven upon the beach, and the whole party landed. Hawkeye and Heyward&#10;ascended an adjacent bluff, where the former, after considering the&#10;expanse of water beneath him, pointed out to the latter a small black&#10;object, hovering under a headland, at the distance of several miles.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you see it?&quot; demanded the scout. &quot;Now, what would you account that&#10;spot, were you left alone to white experience to" />
    <node id=" altered their relative positions.&#10;&#10;&quot;You showed knowledge in the shaping of birchen bark, Uncas, when you&#10;chose this from among the Huron canoes,&quot; said the scout, smiling,&#10;apparently more in satisfaction at their superiority in the race, than&#10;from that prospect of final escape which now began to open a little upon&#10;them. &quot;The imps have put all their strength again at the paddles, and we&#10;are to struggle for our scalps with bits of flattened wood, instead of&#10;clouded barrels and true eyes. A long stroke, and together, friends.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They are preparing for a shot,&quot; said Heyward; &quot;and as we are in a line&#10;with them, it can scarcely fail.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Get you then into the bottom of the canoe,&quot; returned the scout; &quot;you&#10;and the colonel; it will be so much taken from the size of the mark.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward smiled, as he answered,--&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be but an ill example for the highest in rank to dodge, while&#10;the warriors were under fire!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord! Lord! That is now a white man's courage!&quot; exclaimed the scout;&#10;&quot;and like too many" />
    <node id=" look anxiously about him, as if searching for some further&#10;means of assisting their flight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Edge her a little more from the sun, Sagamore,&quot; said the stubborn&#10;woodsman; &quot;I see the knaves are sparing a man to the rifle. A single&#10;broken bone might lose us our scalps. Edge more from the sun and we will&#10;put the island between us.&quot;&#10;&#10;The expedient was not without its use. A long, low island lay at a&#10;little distance before them, and as they closed with it, the chasing&#10;canoe was compelled to take a side opposite to that on which the pursued&#10;passed. The scout and his companions did not neglect this advantage, but&#10;the instant they were hid from observation by the bushes, they redoubled&#10;efforts that before had seemed prodigious. The two canoes came round the&#10;last low point, like two coursers at the top of their speed, the&#10;fugitives taking the lead. This change had brought them nigher to each&#10;other, however, while it altered their relative positions.&#10;&#10;&quot;You showed knowledge in the shaping of birchen bark, Uncas, when you&#10;chose this from among the" />
    <node id=" they advanced exposed them to the danger of some sudden rising on&#10;their progress. The eyes of the Sagamore moved warily from islet to&#10;islet, and copse to copse, as the canoe proceeded; and when a clearer&#10;sheet of water permitted, his keen vision was bent along the bald rocks&#10;and impending forests, that frowned upon the narrow strait.&#10;&#10;Heyward, who was a doubly interested spectator, as well from the&#10;beauties of the place as from the apprehension natural to his situation,&#10;was just believing that he had permitted the latter to be excited&#10;without sufficient reason, when the paddle ceased moving, in obedience&#10;to a signal from Chingachgook.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hugh!&quot; exclaimed Uncas, nearly at the moment that the light tap his&#10;father had made on the side of the canoe notified them of the vicinity&#10;of danger.&#10;&#10;&quot;What now?&quot; asked the scout; &quot;the lake is as smooth as if the winds had&#10;never blown, and I can see along its sheet for miles; there is not so&#10;much as the black head of a loon dotting the water.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Indian gravely raised his paddle, and pointed in the direction in&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;Uncas's discovery refers to him finding the two fillies, with their saddles broken and housings soiled, which suggests that they had been running free for several days. This discovery is significant because it indicates that the party has entered enemy territory and their journey must come to an end. Uncas withheld this information for so long according to Duncan because he was silent and reserved, deferring to his father's guidance before speaking up. When he did finally communicate his success in finding the horses, the party was able to assess their situation and take appropriate action." />
    <node id=" the work with an&#10;eagerness that supplied the place of skill, while Hawkeye was engaged in&#10;inspecting the priming of his rifle. The latter then took a swift aim,&#10;and fired. The Huron in the bows of the leading canoe had risen with a&#10;similar object, and he now fell backward, suffering his gun to escape&#10;from his hands into the water. In an instant, however, he recovered his&#10;feet, though his gestures were wild and bewildered. At the same moment&#10;his companions suspended their efforts, and the chasing canoes clustered&#10;together, and became stationary. Chingachgook and Uncas profited by the&#10;interval to regain their wind, though Duncan continued to work with the&#10;most persevering industry. The father and son now cast calm but&#10;inquiring glances at each other, to learn if either had sustained any&#10;injury by the fire; for both well knew that no cry or exclamation would,&#10;in such a moment of necessity, have been permitted to betray the&#10;accident. A few large drops of blood were trickling down the shoulder of&#10;the Sagamore, who, when he perceived that the eyes of Uncas dwelt too&#10;long on the sight" />
    <node id=" discourse, and as the bullets&#10;whistled about them, Duncan saw the head of Uncas turned, looking back&#10;at himself and Munro. Notwithstanding the nearness of the enemy, and his&#10;own great personal danger, the countenance of the young warrior&#10;expressed no other emotion, as the former was compelled to think, than&#10;amazement at finding men willing to encounter so useless an exposure.&#10;Chingachgook was probably better acquainted with the notions of white&#10;men, for he did not even cast a glance aside from the riveted look his&#10;eye maintained on the object by which he governed their course. A ball&#10;soon struck the light and polished paddle from the hands of the chief,&#10;and drove it through the air, far in the advance. A shout arose from the&#10;Hurons, who seized the opportunity to fire another volley. Uncas&#10;described an arc in the water with his own blade, and as the canoe&#10;passed swiftly on, Chingachgook recovered his paddle, and flourishing it&#10;on high, he gave the war-whoop of the Mohicans, and then lent his&#10;strength and skill again to the important task.&#10;&#10;The clamorous sounds of &quot;Le Gros Serpent" />
    <node id=" the sun&#10;dispersed the mists, and was shedding a strong and clear light in the&#10;forest, when the travellers resumed their journey.&#10;&#10;After proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the&#10;advance, became more deliberate and watchful. He often stopped to&#10;examine the trees; nor did he cross a rivulet, without attentively&#10;considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters.&#10;Distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgook&#10;were frequent and earnest. During one of these conferences, Heyward&#10;observed that Uncas stood a patient and silent, though, as he imagined,&#10;an interested listener. He was strongly tempted to address the young&#10;chief, and demand his opinion of their progress; but the calm and&#10;dignified demeanor of the native induced him to believe that, like&#10;himself, the other was wholly dependent on the sagacity and intelligence&#10;of the seniors of the party. At last, the scout spoke in English, and at&#10;once explained the embarrassment of their situation.&#10;&#10;&quot;When I found that the home path of the Hurons run north,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#10;did" />
    <node id="the warriors were under fire!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord! Lord! That is now a white man's courage!&quot; exclaimed the scout;&#10;&quot;and like too many of his notions, not to be maintained by reason. Do&#10;you think the Sagamore, or Uncas, or even I, who am a man without a&#10;cross, would deliberate about finding a cover in the skrimmage, when an&#10;open body would do no good? For what have the Frenchers reared up their&#10;Quebec, if fighting is always to be done in the clearings?&quot;&#10;&#10;[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner's Sons_&#10;&#10;THE FLIGHT ACROSS THE LAKE&#10;&#10;_The scout having ascertained that the Mohicans were sufficient of&#10;themselves to maintain the requisite distance, deliberately laid aside&#10;his paddle, and raised the fatal rifle_]&#10;&#10;&quot;All that you say is very true, my friend,&quot; replied Heyward; &quot;still,&#10;our customs must prevent us from doing as you wish.&quot;&#10;&#10;A volley from the Hurons interrupted the discourse, and as the bullets&#10;whistled about them, Duncan saw the head of Uncas turned, looking back&#10;at himself and Munro. Notwithstanding" />
    <node id="once explained the embarrassment of their situation.&#10;&#10;&quot;When I found that the home path of the Hurons run north,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#10;did not need the judgment of many long years to tell that they would&#10;follow the valleys, and keep atween the waters of the Hudson and the&#10;Horican, until they might strike the springs of the Canada streams,&#10;which would lead them into the heart of the country of the Frenchers.&#10;Yet here are we, within a short range of the Scaroon, and not a sign of&#10;a trail have we crossed! Human natur' is weak, and it is possible we may&#10;not have taken the proper scent.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heaven protect us from such an error!&quot; exclaimed Duncan. &quot;Let us&#10;retrace our steps, and examine as we go, with keener eyes. Has Uncas no&#10;counsel to offer in such a strait?&quot;&#10;&#10;The young Mohican cast a glance at his father, but maintaining his quiet&#10;and reserved mien, he continued silent. Chingachgook had caught the&#10;look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak. The moment this&#10;permission was accorded, the countenance of" />
    <node id=" the track of the Narragansetts, but they seemed&#10;only to have wandered without guides, or any other object than the&#10;pursuit of food. At length Uncas, who, with his father, had endeavored&#10;to trace the route of the horses, came upon a sign of their presence&#10;that was quite recent. Before following the clue, he communicated his&#10;success to his companions; and while the latter were consulting on the&#10;circumstance, the youth reappeared, leading the two fillies, with their&#10;saddles broken, and the housings soiled, as though they had been&#10;permitted to run at will for several days.&#10;&#10;&quot;What should this mean?&quot; said Duncan, turning pale, and glancing his&#10;eyes around him, as if he feared the brush and leaves were about to give&#10;up some horrid secret.&#10;&#10;&quot;That our march is come to a quick end, and that we are in an enemy's&#10;country,&quot; returned the scout. &quot;Had the knaves been pressed, and the&#10;gentle ones wanted horses to keep up with the party, he might have taken&#10;their scalps; but without an enemy at his heels, and with such rugged&#10;beasts" />

    <node id=" had so long taught him to practise.&#10;&#10;Repeating the words, &quot;fellows who are dodging about the water!&quot; he&#10;added, &quot;so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements!&#10;The knave has long legs, though, and shall not be trusted. Do you keep&#10;him under your rifle while I creep in behind, through the bush, and take&#10;him alive. Fire on no account.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward had already permitted his companion to bury part of his person&#10;in the thicket, when, stretching forth an arm, he arrested him, in order&#10;to ask,--&#10;&#10;&quot;If I see you in danger, may I not risk a shot?&quot;&#10;&#10;Hawkeye regarded him a moment, like one who knew not how to take the&#10;question; then nodding his head, he answered, still laughing, though&#10;inaudibly,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Fire a whole platoon, major.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the next moment he was concealed by the leaves. Duncan waited several&#10;minutes in feverish impatience, before he caught another glimpse of the&#10;scout. Then he reappeared, creeping along the earth, from which his&#10;dress was hardly distinguishable, directly in the rear of his intended" />
    <node id=" of moss, where it would seem an&#10;Indian had inadvertently trodden. Pursuing the direction given by this&#10;discovery, he entered the neighboring thicket, and struck the trail, as&#10;fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring. Another&#10;shout announced the good fortune of the youth to his companions, and at&#10;once terminated the search.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, it has been planned with Indian judgment,&quot; said the scout, when the&#10;party was assembled around the place; &quot;and would have blinded white&#10;eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall we proceed?&quot; demanded Heyward.&#10;&#10;&quot;Softly, softly: we know our path; but it is good to examine the&#10;formation of things. This is my schooling, major; and if one neglects&#10;the book, there is little chance of learning from the open hand of&#10;Providence. All is plain but one thing, which is the manner that the&#10;knave contrived to get the gentle ones along the blind trail. Even a&#10;Huron would be too proud to let their tender feet touch the water.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?&quot; said Heyward, pointing&#10;towards the fragments of a sort of handbarrow," />
    <node id=" your son. No, no,&quot; continued the scout,&#10;looking back at the dim shore of William Henry, which was now fast&#10;receding, and laughing in his own silent but heartfelt manner; &quot;I have&#10;put a trail of water atween us; and unless the imps can make friends&#10;with the fishes, and hear who has paddled across their basin, this fine&#10;morning, we shall throw the length of the Horican behind us, before they&#10;have made up their minds which path to take.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;With foes in front, and foes in our rear, our journey is like to be one&#10;of danger.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Danger!&quot; repeated Hawkeye, calmly; &quot;no, not absolutely of danger; for,&#10;with vigilant ears and quick eyes, we can manage to keep a few hours&#10;ahead of the knaves; or, if we must try the rifle, there are three of us&#10;who understand its gifts as well as any you can name on the borders. No,&#10;not of danger; but that we shall have what you may call a brisk push of&#10;it is probable; and it may happen, a brush, a skrimmage, or some such&#10;divarsion, but always where" />
    <node id=" came under his view. Then lowering the dangerous&#10;muzzle, he stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny&#10;that was already intensely keen.&#10;&#10;&quot;The imp is not a Huron,&quot; he said, &quot;nor of any of the Canada tribes; and&#10;yet you see, by his clothes, the knave has been plundering a white. Ay,&#10;Montcalm has raked the woods for his inroad, and a whooping, murdering&#10;set of varlets has he gathered together. Can you see where he has put&#10;his rifle or his bow?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He appears to have no arms; nor does he seem to be viciously inclined.&#10;Unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows, who as you see are&#10;dodging about the water, we have but little to fear from him.&quot;&#10;&#10;The scout turned to Heyward, and regarded him a moment with unconcealed&#10;amazement. Then opening wide his mouth, he indulged in unrestrained and&#10;heartfelt laughter, though in that silent and peculiar manner which&#10;danger had so long taught him to practise.&#10;&#10;Repeating the words, &quot;fellows who are dodging about the water!&quot; he&#10;added, &quot;so much" />
    <node id=" himself, generally, on rocks with safety. Shove in the&#10;canoe nigher to the land, Uncas; this sand will take a stamp as easily&#10;as the butter of the Jarmans on the Mohawk. Softly, lad, softly; it must&#10;not touch the beach, or the knaves will know by what road we have left&#10;the place.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young man observed the precaution; and the scout, laying a board&#10;from the ruins to the canoe, made a sign for the two officers to enter.&#10;When this was done, everything was studiously restored to its former&#10;disorder; and then Hawkeye succeeded in reaching his little birchen&#10;vessel, without leaving behind him any of those marks which he appeared&#10;so much to dread. Heyward was silent, until the Indians had cautiously&#10;paddled the canoe some distance from the fort, and within the broad and&#10;dark shadow that fell from the eastern mountain on the glassy surface of&#10;the lake; then he demanded,--&#10;&#10;&quot;What need have we for this stolen and hurried departure?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If the blood of an Oneida could stain such a sheet of pure water as&#10;this we float on,&quot; returned the scout" />
    <node id=" When Heyward asks Hawkeye if he can shoot if he sees him in danger while creeping up on their target, Hawkeye responds by saying &quot;Fire a whole platoon, major.&quot; This response suggests that Hawkeye is giving Heyward permission to use his own judgment and fire his rifle if necessary to protect himself or others from danger. The phrase &quot;fire a whole platoon&quot; is likely an exaggeration meant to convey the idea that Heyward should not hesitate to use his weapon if the situation calls for it." />
    <node id=" this distance; but 'Killdeer' has a barrel on which a man may&#10;calculate.&quot;&#10;&#10;The scout having ascertained that the Mohicans were sufficient of&#10;themselves to maintain the requisite distance, deliberately laid aside&#10;his paddle, and raised the fatal rifle. Three several times he brought&#10;the piece to his shoulder, and when his companions were expecting its&#10;report, he as often lowered it to request the Indians would permit their&#10;enemies to approach a little nigher. At length his accurate and&#10;fastidious eye seemed satisfied, and throwing out his left arm on the&#10;barrel, he was slowly elevating the muzzle, when an exclamation from&#10;Uncas, who sat in the bow, once more caused him to suspend the shot.&#10;&#10;&quot;What now, lad?&quot; demanded Hawkeye; &quot;you saved a Huron from the&#10;death-shriek by that word; have you reason for what you do?&quot;&#10;&#10;Uncas pointed towards the rocky shore a little in their front, whence&#10;another war canoe was darting directly across their course. It was too&#10;obvious now that their situation was imminently perilous to need the aid&#10;of language to confirm it. The scout laid aside his rifle" />
    <node id=" head,&#10;instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look, began to turn&#10;suspiciously from side to side, as if he were conscious of approaching&#10;danger. He soon stopped again, and waited for the whole party to come&#10;up.&#10;&#10;&quot;I scent the Hurons,&quot; he said, speaking to the Mohicans; &quot;yonder is open&#10;sky, through the tree-tops, and we are getting too nigh their&#10;encampment. Sagamore, you will take the hillside, to the right; Uncas&#10;will bend along the brook to the left, while I will try the trail. If&#10;anything should happen, the call will be three croaks of a crow. I saw&#10;one of the birds fanning himself in the air, just beyond the dead&#10;oak--another sign that we are touching an encampment.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Indians departed their several ways without reply, while Hawkeye&#10;cautiously proceeded with the two gentlemen. Heyward soon pressed to the&#10;side of their guide, eager to catch an early glimpse of those enemies he&#10;had pursued with so much toil and anxiety. His companion told him to&#10;steal to the edge of the wood, which, as usual," />
    <node id="The 'savage' encountered at the suspected encampment is described as having a forlorn and miserable appearance. He is wearing a ragged calico mantle and an ordinary shirt with the sleeves serving as his nether garment. His legs are bare and cut by briers, but he has good deer-skin moccasins on his feet. Hawkeye reacts to seeing him by staring at him intently and lowering his rifle when he realizes that the 'savage' is unaware of their presence. This suggests that Hawkeye was considering using his weapon, but changed his mind when he saw that it was not necessary." />
    <node id=" the&#10;scout. Then he reappeared, creeping along the earth, from which his&#10;dress was hardly distinguishable, directly in the rear of his intended&#10;captive. Having reached within a few yards of the latter, he arose to&#10;his feet, silently and slowly. At that instant, several loud blows were&#10;struck on the water, and Duncan turned his eyes just in time to perceive&#10;that a hundred dark forms were plunging, in a body, into the troubled&#10;little sheet. Grasping his rifle, his looks were again bent on the&#10;Indian near him. Instead of taking the alarm, the unconscious savage&#10;stretched forward his neck, as if he also watched the movements about&#10;the gloomy lake, with a sort of silly curiosity. In the meantime, the&#10;uplifted hand of Hawkeye was above him. But, without any apparent&#10;reason, it was withdrawn, and its owner indulged in another long, though&#10;still silent, fit of merriment. When the peculiar and hearty laughter of&#10;Hawkeye was ended, instead of grasping his victim by the throat, he&#10;tapped him lightly on the shoulder, and exclaimed aloud,--&#10;&#10;&quot;How now, friend! have you a mind to teach" />
    <node id=" of the crown, from&#10;whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawk's wing were loosely&#10;dangling. A ragged calico mantle half-encircled his body, while his&#10;nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt, the sleeves of which&#10;were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more&#10;commodious arrangement. His legs were bare, and sadly cut and torn by&#10;briers. The feet were, however, covered with a pair of good deer-skin&#10;moccasins. Altogether, the appearance of the individual was forlorn and&#10;miserable.&#10;&#10;Duncan was still curiously observing the person of his neighbor, when&#10;the scout stole silently and cautiously to his side.&#10;&#10;&quot;You see we have reached their settlement or encampment,&quot; whispered the&#10;young man; &quot;and here is one of the savages himself, in a very&#10;embarrassing position for our further movements.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hawkeye started, and dropped his rifle, directed by the finger of his&#10;companion, the stranger came under his view. Then lowering the dangerous&#10;muzzle, he stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny&#10;that was already intensely keen" />
    <node id=" scout, gazing about him with a countenance of concern; &quot;but they&#10;give no cover, except it be to the fishes. God knows what the country&#10;would be, if the settlements should ever spread far from the two rivers.&#10;Both hunting and war would lose their beauty.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us not delay a moment, without some good and obvious cause.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I little like that smoke, which you may see worming up along the rock&#10;above the canoe,&quot; interrupted the abstracted scout. &quot;My life on it,&#10;other eyes than ours see it, and know its meaning. Well, words will not&#10;mend the matter, and it is time that we were doing.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hawkeye moved away from the look-out, and descended, musing profoundly,&#10;to the shore. He communicated the result of his observations to his&#10;companions, in Delaware, and a short and earnest consultation succeeded.&#10;When it terminated, the three instantly set about executing their new&#10;resolutions.&#10;&#10;The canoe was lifted from the water, and borne on the shoulders of the&#10;party. They proceeded into the wood, making as broad and obvious a trail&#10;as possible. They soon reached a water-course, which they" />
    <node id=" Heyward, Chingachgook, Uncas, and the scout were entering the narrows of the lake at dawn, cautiously navigating through numerous little islands while being extra vigilant. They suspected that Montcalm might have left some Indians in ambush along this passage, as it was the road by which Montcalm had retreated with his army. The group was on high alert, looking for any signs of danger and carefully making their way through the intricate channels." />

Just as the day&#10;dawned, they entered the narrows of the lake,[23] and stole swiftly and&#10;cautiously among their numberless little islands. It was by this road&#10;that Montcalm had retired with his army; and the adventurers knew not&#10;but he had left some of his Indians in ambush, to protect the rear of&#10;his forces, and collect the stragglers. They, therefore, approached the&#10;passage with the customary silence of their guarded habits.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook laid aside his paddle; while Uncas and the scout urged the&#10;light vessel through crooked and intricate channels, where every foot&#10;that they advanced exposed them to the danger of some sudden rising on&#10;their progress.

There is a vast difference between throwing a&#10;regiment of white coats atwixt the tribes and the prisoners, and coaxing&#10;an angry savage to forget he carries a knife and a rifle, with words&#10;that must begin with calling him your son.

The adventurers assumed their&#10;arms and packs, and the scout announced to Munro and Heyward that he and&#10;the Indians were at last in readiness to proceed.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;  &quot;If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.&quot;&#10;&#10;  _Merry Wives of Windsor._&#10;&#10;&#10;The party had landed on the border of a region that is, even to this&#10;day, less known to the inhabitants of the States, than the deserts of&#10;Arabia, or the steppes of Tartary.

    <node id=" Since the period of our tale,&#10;the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich&#10;and thriving settlements, though none but the hunter or the savage is&#10;ever known, even now, to penetrate its wild recesses.&#10;&#10;As Hawkeye and the Mohicans had, however, often traversed the mountains&#10;and valleys of this vast wilderness, they did not hesitate to plunge&#10;into its depths, with the freedom of men accustomed to its privations&#10;and difficulties. For many hours the travellers toiled on their&#10;laborious way, guided by a star, or following the direction of some&#10;water-course, until the scout called a halt, and holding a short&#10;consultation with the Indians, they lighted their fire, and made the&#10;usual preparations to pass the remainder of the night where they then&#10;were.&#10;&#10;Imitating the example, and emulating the confidence, of their more&#10;experienced associates, Munro and Duncan slept without fear, if not&#10;without uneasiness. The dews were suffered to exhale, and the sun&#10;dispersed the mists, and was shedding a strong and clear light in the&#10;forest, when the travellers resumed their journey.&#10;&#10;" />

They soon reached a water-course, which they crossed, and&#10;continued onward, until they came to an extensive and naked rock. At&#10;this point, where their footsteps might be expected to be no longer&#10;visible, they retraced their route to the brook, walking backwards, with&#10;the utmost care. They now followed the bed of the little stream to the&#10;lake, into which they immediately launched their canoe again. A low&#10;point concealed them from the headland, and the margin of the lake was&#10;fringed for some distance with dense and overhanging bushes. Under the&#10;cover of these natural advantages, they toiled their way, with patient&#10;industry, until the scout pronounced that he believed it would be safe&#10;once more to land.&#10;&#10;The halt continued until evening rendered objects indistinct and&#10;uncertain to the eye. Then they resumed their route, and, favored by the&#10;darkness, pushed silently and vigorously towards the western shore.&#10;Although the rugged outline of mountain, to which they were steering,&#10;presented no distinctive marks to the eyes of Duncan, the Mohican&#10;ent" />
    <node id=" with three of the best pair of eyes on the borders, in his rear.&quot;&#10;&#10;The spirits of the scout, and the astonishing success of the chase, in&#10;which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed,&#10;did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party. Their&#10;advance was rapid; and made with as much confidence as a traveller would&#10;proceed along a wide highway. If a rock, or a rivulet, or a bit of earth&#10;harder than common, severed the links of the clue they followed, the&#10;true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance, and seldom rendered&#10;the delay of a single moment necessary. Their progress was much&#10;facilitated by the certainty that Magua had found it necessary to&#10;journey through the valleys; a circumstance which rendered the general&#10;direction of the route sure. Nor had the Huron entirely neglected the&#10;arts uniformly practised by the natives when retiring in front of any&#10;enemy. False trails, and sudden turnings, were frequent, wherever a&#10;brook, or the formation of the ground, rendered them feasible; but his&#10;pursuers were rarely deceived, and never failed to detect their error,&#10;before they had" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, we can infer several things about the progress of the hunt. First, Uncas has identified a fresh trail left by an animal or person, which the scout confirms as a canoe paddled by &quot;fierce and crafty Mingos&quot; (Huron warriors). The scout seems knowledgeable and experienced in tracking, able to interpret signs that others might miss, such as the impression of a foot on a bunch of moss. He also demonstrates an awareness of the dangers of being pursued, recognizing that the Hurons will likely follow their trail once it gets dark.&#10;&#10;The party follows the trail along a rill until they reach a dry rock, where they pause to make sure the Hurons haven't left the water. Uncas then discovers a fresh footprint in the neighboring thicket, which leads them to an earthen fort. The scout advises his companions to step on stones and fragments of wood as they clamber through the ruins surrounding the fort, suggesting that he is aware of the importance of leaving no trace for their pursuers.&#10;&#10;Once they reach the other side of the fort, the scout declares that the trail is now invisible to all but those with a keen sense of smell. He dashes forward confidently, and soon after, Uncas locates the tracks of the horses that the party had been following before. The scout interprets this as a sign that they have entered enemy territory, and that the horses' riders may have abandoned them to move more quickly on foot. Overall, the scout's observations suggest that he is confident in his ability to track the Hurons and navigate the wilderness, while also recognizing the dangers that pursuers can pose." />
    <node id=" caught the&#10;look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak. The moment this&#10;permission was accorded, the countenance of Uncas changed from its grave&#10;composure to a gleam of intelligence and joy. Bounding forward like a&#10;deer, he sprang up the side of a little acclivity, a few rods in&#10;advance, and stood exultingly over a spot of fresh earth that looked as&#10;though it had been recently upturned by the passage of some heavy&#10;animal. The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement,&#10;and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis the trail!&quot; exclaimed the scout, advancing to the spot: &quot;the lad&#10;is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis extraordinary that he should have withheld his knowledge so long,&quot;&#10;muttered Duncan, at his elbow.&#10;&#10;&quot;It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding. No,&#10;no; your young white, who gathers his learning from books and can&#10;measure what he knows by the page, may conceit that his knowledge, like&#10;his legs, outruns that of his father;" />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you see it?&quot; demanded the scout. &quot;Now, what would you account that&#10;spot, were you left alone to white experience to find your way through&#10;this wilderness?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But for its distance and its magnitude, I should suppose it a bird. Can&#10;it be a living object?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis a canoe of good birchen bark, and paddled by fierce and crafty&#10;Mingos. Though Providence has lent to those who inhabit the woods eyes&#10;that would be needless to men in the settlements, where there are&#10;inventions to assist the sight, yet no human organs can see all the&#10;dangers which at this moment circumvent us. These varlets pretend to be&#10;bent chiefly on their sun-down meal, but the moment it is dark they will&#10;be on our trail, as true as hounds on the scent. We must throw them off,&#10;or our pursuit of Le Renard Subtil may be given up. These lakes are&#10;useful at times, especially when the game takes the water,&quot; continued&#10;the scout, gazing about him with a countenance of concern; &quot;but they&#10;give no cover, except it be to the fishes. God knows what the country" />
    <node id=" first, and the others have trod&#10;in his steps, imitating their formation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But,&quot; cried Duncan, &quot;I see no signs of--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The gentle ones,&quot; interrupted the scout; &quot;the varlet has found a way to&#10;carry them, until he supposed he had thrown any followers off the scent.&#10;My life on it, we see their pretty little feet again, before many rods&#10;go by.&quot;&#10;&#10;The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rill, keeping&#10;anxious eyes on the regular impressions. The water soon flowed into its&#10;bed again, but watching the ground on either side, the foresters pursued&#10;their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath. More than&#10;half a mile was passed, before the rill rippled close around the base of&#10;an extensive and dry rock. Here they paused to make sure that the Hurons&#10;had not quitted the water.&#10;&#10;It was fortunate they did so. For the quick and active Uncas soon found&#10;the impression of a foot on a bunch of moss, where it would seem an&#10;Indian had inadvertently trodden. Pursuing the direction given by this&#10;discovery, he entered the neighboring thicket" />
    <node id=" continued,&#10;turning towards a curtain of the works; &quot;let us get into the ditch on&#10;this side, and be regardful to step on the stones and fragments of wood&#10;as you go.&quot;&#10;&#10;His companions complied, though to two of them the reasons of this&#10;extraordinary precaution were yet a mystery. When they were in the low&#10;cavity that surrounded the earthen fort on three sides, they found the&#10;passage nearly choked by the ruins. With care and patience, however,&#10;they succeeded in clambering after the scout, until they reached the&#10;sandy shore of the Horican.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a trail that nothing but a nose can follow,&quot; said the satisfied&#10;scout, looking back along their difficult way; &quot;grass is a treacherous&#10;carpet for a flying party to tread on, but wood and stone take no print&#10;from a moccasin. Had you worn your armed boots, there might, indeed,&#10;have been something to fear; but with the deer-skin suitably prepared, a&#10;man may trust himself, generally, on rocks with safety.

Ay, here are both your&#10;waddling beasts: this Huron travels like a white general. The fellow is&#10;stricken with a judgment, and is mad! Look sharp for wheels, Sagamore,&quot;&#10;he continued, looking back, and laughing in his newly awakened&#10;satisfaction; &quot;we shall soon have the fool journeying in a coach, and&#10;that with three of the best pair of eyes on the borders, in his rear.&quot;&#10;&#10;The spirits of the scout, and the astonishing success of the chase," />
    <node id=" The Native Americans are signaling a stop because they have spotted a thin streak of mist rising above an islet, with an edging of blacker smoke hanging along its lower side. This indicates the presence of a fire on the islet, which suggests the vicinity of their enemies, the Hurons or French. However, the scout cannot see this danger at first because he is focusing on detecting any signs of disturbance on the water's surface, and the calm lake appears free of such signs. It is only when Chingachgook points out the unnatural mist and the edging of blacker smoke that the scout recognizes the fire on the islet as a sign of danger." />
    <node id=" The Mohicans, Chingachgook and Uncas, show no perceptible emotion when their enemies fire volleys at them during the canoe chase. Their rigid features express neither hope nor alarm. Hawkeye, the scout, explains that this is because the enemies, who are Native American as well (Mingos or Hurons), struggle to calculate an accurate range for their bullets in a moving canoe. The canoe's motion makes it difficult for them to aim accurately, and they often need to reload after each shot, slowing down their rate of fire. Hawkeye also notes that these enemies seem to value the sound of their guns more than their accuracy. In contrast, Hawkeye deliberately waits for a clearer shot, only firing when he is satisfied with the range and his ability to hit the target." />
    <node id="op of the Mohicans, and then lent his&#10;strength and skill again to the important task.&#10;&#10;The clamorous sounds of &quot;Le Gros Serpent!&quot; &quot;La Longue Carabine!&quot; &quot;Le&#10;Cerf Agile!&quot; burst at once from the canoes behind, and seemed to give&#10;new zeal to the pursuers. The scout seized &quot;Killdeer&quot; in his left hand,&#10;and elevating it above his head, he shook it in triumph at his enemies.&#10;The savages answered the insult with a yell, and immediately another&#10;volley succeeded. The bullets pattered along the lake, and one even&#10;pierced the bark of their little vessel. No perceptible emotion could be&#10;discovered in the Mohicans during this critical moment, their rigid&#10;features expressing neither hope nor alarm; but the scout again turned&#10;his head, and laughing in his own silent manner, he said to Heyward,--&#10;&#10;&quot;The knaves love to hear the sounds of their pieces; but the eye is not&#10;to be found among the Mingos that can calculate a true range in a&#10;dancing canoe! You see the dumb devils have taken off a man to charge,&#10;and by the smallest measurement that" />
    <node id="The foresters, consisting of Heyward, Chingachgook, Uncas, and the scout, are navigating through a lake at dawn, being cautious as they suspect that Montcalm might have left some Indians in ambush along this passage. They are looking for signs of danger and carefully making their way through the intricate channels.&#10;&#10;Uncas found a clue that allowed them to continue their pursuit of the Hurons by discovering the two fillies, with their saddles broken and housings soiled, which suggests that they had been running free for several days. This discovery indicates that the party has entered enemy territory and their journey must come to an end." />
    <node id=" At the break of dawn, Hawkeye and his companions engage in several actions and follow specific instructions to ensure their safety. First, they have a canoe but lift it from the water and carry it on their shoulders into the woods, making sure to leave a broad and obvious trail. They then reach a water-course and continue through the woods with Uncas leading them towards the hills behind Ticonderoga, where Montcalm's army is known to be. After hours of cautious travel, they land the canoe at a bay near the northern terminus of the lake. Hawkeye and Heyward then ascend a bluff, where Hawkeye points out a small black object several miles away, asking Heyward to identify it.&#10;&#10;Throughout this process, Hawkeye advises Heyward not to fire his rifle under any circumstances while creeping up on their target and only do so if he sees Heyward in danger. Hawkeye also changes his mind about using his weapon when he realizes the 'savage' is unaware of their presence. This cautious behavior suggests that they are aware of potential dangers and are taking measures to avoid detection while maintaining the ability to defend themselves if necessary." />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye and his companions lift their canoe from the water, carry it into the woods, and create a broad trail as a strategic move to make it appear as if they want to be noticed. They hope that by doing so, any potential enemies will believe that they are not trying to hide and thus reduce the risk of being attacked. This action also serves as a decoy to divert attention from their actual intention, which is to approach the source of the smoke cautiously and investigate any possible danger. By creating an obvious trail, they can move through the woods more covertly while maintaining the ability to defend themselves if necessary." />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Major Duncan Heyward, Colonel Munro, and the Sagamore have decided not to engage in battle with their enemies, the Hurons, who are approaching distance. Instead, they choose to continue their journey across the lake, increasing their distance from the enemy. This decision is made after the Sagamore demonstrates that his injury, which was caused by a previous encounter with the Hurons, is minor. Heyward, in particular, emphasizes the importance of this decision by reminding the group of their main objective and purpose for traveling." />

Let them come&#10;up within striking distance--my eye may well be trusted in such a&#10;matter--and I will trail the varlets the length of the Horican,&#10;guaranteeing that not a shot of theirs shall, at the worst, more than&#10;break the skin, while 'Killdeer' shall touch the life twice in three&#10;times.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We forget our errand,&quot; returned the diligent Duncan. &quot;For God's sake&#10;let us profit by this advantage, and increase our distance from the&#10;enemy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Give me my children,&quot; said Munro hoarsely; &quot;trifle no longer with" />

But he was said to be alone, and dead men give no cause&#10;for fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, he was alone in his deviltry! but an Indian whose tribe counts so&#10;many warriors, need seldom fear his blood will run, without the&#10;death-shriek coming speedily from some of his enemies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But our presence--the authority of Colonel Munro--would prove a&#10;sufficient protection against the anger of our allies, especially in a&#10;case where a wretch so well merited his fate. I trust in Heaven you have&#10;not deviated a single foot from the direct line of our course, with so&#10;slight a reason!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you think the bullet of that varlet's rifle would have turned aside,&#10;though his majesty the king had stood in its path?&quot; returned the&#10;stubborn scout. &quot;Why did not the grand Fren" />
    <node id="&#10;Duncan, the white man, perceives several suspicious and inexplicable movements in the seemingly abandoned Native American village. First, he notices that the rounded roofs of the dwellings are more solidly built than usual, indicating a higher level of industry and foresight. However, the village appears to be deserted, and Duncan grows wary when he sees several human forms approaching him while moving swiftly and silently, dragging what he assumes to be some sort of formidable engine.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Duncan observes a few dark-looking heads emerging from the dwellings, and the place suddenly appears alive with beings that glide from cover to cover so quickly that he cannot examine their intentions or activities. These mysterious movements make Duncan feel alarmed and uneasy, as he is unable to understand what might be happening in this Native American settlement." />
    <node id=" so swiftly, as to&#10;allow no opportunity of examining their humors or pursuits. Alarmed at&#10;these suspicious and inexplicable movements, he was about to attempt the&#10;signal of the crows, when the rustling of leaves at hand drew his eyes&#10;in another direction.&#10;&#10;The young man started, and recoiled a few paces instinctively, when he&#10;found himself within a hundred yards of a stranger Indian. Recovering&#10;his recollection on the instant, instead of sounding an alarm, which&#10;might prove fatal to himself, he remained stationary, an attentive&#10;observer of the other's motions.&#10;&#10;An instant of calm observation served to assure Duncan that he was&#10;undiscovered. The native, like himself, seemed occupied in considering&#10;the low dwellings of the village, and the stolen movements of its&#10;inhabitants. It was impossible to discover the expression of his&#10;features, through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were&#10;concealed; though Duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage.&#10;His head was shaved, as usual, with the exception of the crown, from&#10;whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawk's wing were loosely&#10;dangling.

Their rounded roofs,&#10;admirably moulded for defence against the weather, denoted more of&#10;industry and foresight than the natives were wont to bestow on their&#10;regular habitations, much less on those they occupied for the temporary&#10;purposes of hunting and war. In short, the whole village or town,&#10;whichever it might be termed, possessed more of method and neatness of&#10;execution, than the white men had been accustomed to believe belonged,&#10;ordinarily, to the Indian habits. It appeared, however, to be deserted.&#10;At least, so thought Duncan for many minutes; but, at length, he fancied&#10;he discovered several human forms advancing towards him on all fours,&#10;and apparently dragging in their train some heavy, and as he was quick&#10;to apprehend, some formidable engine. Just then a few dark looking heads&#10;gleamed out of the dwellings, and the place seemed suddenly alive with&#10;beings, which, however, glided from cover to cover so swiftly, as to&#10;allow no opportunity of examining their humors or pursuits. Alarmed at&#10;these suspicious and inexplicable movements, he was about to attempt" />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye advises Heyward not to fire his rifle under any circumstances while creeping up on the knave, and only to do so if he sees Heyward in danger. This instruction is conveyed through Hawkeye's response to Heyward's question about firing if he sees him in danger, where Hawkeye says &quot;Fire a whole platoon, major,&quot; implying that Heyward should use his judgment and fire only if necessary to protect himself or others from danger." />
    <node id=" The narrative does not provide a direct explanation from Heyward regarding why the Marquis of Montcalm could not prevent the massacre of the British prisoners by the Hurons. However, Heyward does mention that there is a difference between Montcalm ordering a regiment of soldiers to physically stand between the Hurons and the prisoners, and trying to persuade an angry savage to forget their desire for revenge with words. This suggests that Heyward believes Montcalm's influence over the Hurons may have limits, particularly when it comes to situations where the Hurons are driven by strong emotions such as anger or a desire for revenge. Additionally, Heyward's comment that Montcalm will have to settle the matter with his God implies that he sees the massacre as a moral failure on Montcalm's part, possibly due to an inability or unwillingness to exercise enough control over his Huron allies." />
    <node id="The discovery of the moccasin print in the moist alluvion by Uncas is significant because it provides evidence that someone had passed through the area recently. However, Hawkeye notes that the footprint does not belong to an Indian, as it has a different shape and weight distribution than that of an Indian's footprint. The weight is too much on the heel, and the toes are squared, as though one of the French dancers had been in, pigeon-winging his tribe! This suggests that the person who made the footprint is likely a non-native person wearing moccasins.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye's confusion about whether the footprint belongs to an Indian or not stems from his expertise in tracking and identifying different people's footprints. He is able to determine the size, shape, and weight distribution of a person's footprint and use that information to identify their tribe or origin. In this case, the footprint does not match any known Native American footprints, which is why Hawkeye finds it puzzling." />
    <node id=" Not a leaf was left unturned. The sticks were removed, and&#10;the stones lifted; for Indian cunning was known frequently to adopt&#10;these objects as covers, laboring with the utmost patience and industry,&#10;to conceal each footstep as they proceeded. Still no discovery was made.&#10;At length Uncas, whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion&#10;of the task the soonest, raked the earth across the turbid little rill&#10;which ran from the spring, and diverted its course into another channel.&#10;So soon as its narrow bed below the dam was dry, he stooped over it with&#10;keen and curious eyes. A cry of exultation immediately announced the&#10;success of the young warrior. The whole party crowded to the spot where&#10;Uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion.&#10;&#10;&quot;The lad will be an honor to his people,&quot; said Hawkeye, regarding the&#10;trail with as much admiration as a naturalist would expend on the tusk&#10;of a mammoth or the rib of a mastodon; &quot;ay, and a thorn in the sides of&#10;the Hurons.

    <node id=" water.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Will this assist in explaining the difficulty?&quot; said Heyward, pointing&#10;towards the fragments of a sort of handbarrow, that had been rudely&#10;constructed of boughs, and bound together with withes, and which now&#10;seemed carelessly cast aside as useless.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis explained!&quot; cried the delighted Hawkeye. &quot;If them varlets have&#10;passed a minute, they have spent hours in striving to fabricate a lying&#10;end to their trail! Well, I've known them to waste a day in the same&#10;manner, to as little purpose. Here we have three pair of moccasins, and&#10;two of little feet. It is amazing that any mortal beings can journey on&#10;limbs so small! Pass me the thong of buckskin, Uncas, and let me take&#10;the length of this foot. By the Lord, it is no longer than a child's and&#10;yet the maidens are tall and comely. That Providence is partial in its&#10;gifts, for its own wise reasons, the best and most contented of us must&#10;allow.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The tender limbs of my daughters are unequal to these hardships,&quot; said&#10;M" />
    <node id=" Based on the scout's observations, the &quot;imp&quot; appears to be a white man who has been plundering other whites, as evidenced by his clothes. The scout also notes that the imp does not have any weapons and does not seem viciously inclined, unless he communicates the alarm to his fellows. However, Heyward points out that there are several men hiding near the water, which the scout finds amusing when Heyward refers to them as &quot;fellows.&quot; The scout finds this amusing because he recognizes that they are in fact enemies trying to ambush them, and the use of the term &quot;fellows&quot; is overly casual and dismissive given the danger they are in." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, we can infer that the &quot;dark-haired person&quot; being tracked by Uncas and the scout is likely a non-native individual, given that the footprint found in the moist alluvion does not match any known Native American footprints. The person is described as having a different shape and weight distribution in their footprint, with more weight on the heel and squared toes, which suggests they are wearing moccasins but are not an Indian.&#10;&#10;The scout's observations suggest that this individual is leaving a clear trail, which they are able to follow easily, indicating that the person may not be aware they are being tracked or may not be skilled in hiding their tracks. The scout's confident and even joking demeanor while tracking the person indicates that they are not seen as an imminent threat, but rather someone who is perhaps lost or unaware of the danger they are in.&#10;&#10;Overall, the abilities of the dark-haired person being tracked are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that they may lack skill in hiding their tracks and may be unaware of the pursuit." />
    <node id="The pursuing party was able to successfully follow Magua with the help of their scout due to the scout's exceptional tracking skills and knowledge of native tactics. The scout was able to recover the trail when it was lost, even after rocks, rivulets, or harder bits of earth severed the links of the clue they followed. He also detected Magua's false trails and sudden turnings, facilitating their progress through the valleys. The scout's certainty about the general direction of the route, as well as his caution and vigilance, contributed to their ability to maintain their pursuit despite obstacles and uncertainty." />
    <node id=". Ay, ay, a man who uses his throat altogether, can hardly&#10;give his legs a proper training.&quot;&#10;&#10;From such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the&#10;truth, with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a&#10;witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated.&#10;Cheered by these assurances, and satisfied by a reasoning that was so&#10;obvious, while it was so simple, the party resumed its course, after&#10;making a short halt to take a hurried repast.&#10;&#10;When the meal was ended, the scout cast a glance upwards at the setting&#10;sun, and pushed forward with a rapidity which compelled Heyward and the&#10;still vigorous Munro to exert all their muscles to equal. Their route&#10;now lay along the bottom which had already been mentioned. As the Hurons&#10;had made no further efforts to conceal their footsteps, the progress of&#10;the pursuers was no longer delayed by uncertainty. Before an hour had&#10;elapsed, however, the speed of Hawkeye sensibly abated, and his head,&#10;instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look, began to turn&#10;suspiciously from side to side, as if he were conscious of approaching" />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye and the others conclude that the &quot;knave&quot; (an enemy Indian) managed to lead the women (the &quot;gentle ones&quot;) along the blind trail by carrying them on a hand-barrow. The remnants of the hand-barrow, which Heyward points out to Ḥawkeye, confirm this theory. The knave likely carried the women on the hand-barrow until he thought he had successfully thrown any followers off his scent, at which point he probably set them down and continued on foot. Ḥawkeye believes that they will soon find evidence of the women's &quot;pretty little feet&quot; along the trail, as the knave has left the water and is likely traveling through the forest." />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye advises Heyward not to fire his rifle under any circumstances while he moves in to capture the target alive. However, Heyward can use his judgment and fire his rifle if he sees Heyward in danger. Hawkeye gives this permission by saying &quot;Fire a whole platoon, major,&quot; indicating that Heyward should not hesitate to use his weapon to protect himself or others from danger. This cautious behavior suggests that they are aware of potential dangers and are taking measures to avoid detection while maintaining the ability to defend themselves if necessary." />
    <node id=" After Munro demands his children back, Hawkeye, Duncan, and the Mohicans make efforts to increase their distance from the enemy by continuing to paddle and maintain their speed in the canoe. Despite having just been through an intense chase, they are able to do this because the motion of the canoe makes it difficult for their enemies to aim accurately, and the enemies seem to value the sound of their guns more than their accuracy. Hawkeye deliberately waits for a clear shot before firing his rifle, while the enemies fire many shots that miss their target.&#10;&#10;After they reach the lake and begin to paddle away from their enemies, they continue to maintain their pace by keeping their strokes measured and regular. The Mohicans, Chingachgook and Uncas, show no emotion during the chase and do not appear disturbed by the enemy's gunfire, as they are skilled at finding cover and avoiding bullets. Hawkeye notes that they have &quot;white man's courage&quot; and deliberate about finding cover in a skirmish, rather than standing out in the open.&#10;&#10;Later in the narrative, after Duncan and the others come across signs of their enemies on horseback, they continue to increase their distance from the enemy by following Uncas' lead and hurrying their departure. Hawkeye advises Heyward not to fire his rifle unless he sees him in danger, as their presence and the authority of Colonel Munro should be sufficient protection against the anger of their allies." />
    <node id=" advantage, and increase our distance from the&#10;enemy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Give me my children,&quot; said Munro hoarsely; &quot;trifle no longer with a&#10;father's agony, but restore me my babes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Long and habitual deference to the mandates of his superiors had taught&#10;the scout the virtue of obedience. Throwing a last and lingering glance&#10;at the distant canoes, he laid aside his rifle, and relieving the&#10;wearied Duncan, resumed the paddle, which he wielded with sinews that&#10;never tired. His efforts were seconded by those of the Mohicans, and a&#10;very few minutes served to place such a sheet of water between them and&#10;their enemies, that Heyward once more breathed freely.&#10;&#10;The lake now began to expand, and their route lay along a wide reach,&#10;that was lined, as before, by high and ragged mountains. But the islands&#10;were few, and easily avoided. The strokes of the paddles grew more&#10;measured and regular, while they who plied them continued their labor,&#10;after the close and deadly chase from which they had just relieved&#10;themselves, with as much coolness as though their speed had been tried&#10;in sport, rather than" />
    <node id=" According to Heyward, the Marquis of Montcalm may not have been able to prevent the Huron attack on the British prisoners because there are limits to his influence over the Hurons, particularly when it comes to situations where they are driven by strong emotions such as anger or a desire for revenge. Additionally, Heyward suggests that Montcalm's failure to prevent the massacre may have been a moral failure on his part due to an inability or unwillingness to exercise enough control over his Huron allies. This is indicated by Heyward's comment that Montcalm will have to settle the matter with his God." />
    <node id="The adventurers in the narrative might face several dangers as they travel in the narrows of the lake. Given their suspicion that Montcalm may have left some Indians in ambush along this passage, there is a risk of encountering hostile forces lying in wait to attack. The discovery of an enemy fire on the islet, indicated by the thin streak of mist and blacker smoke, further confirms this danger. The presence of Hurons or French enemies nearby increases the vulnerability of the party, making caution essential for their survival.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook is especially cautious during this part of the journey because he has a keen sense of observation and experience in identifying signs of danger. His Native American background and knowledge of enemy tactics make him more vigilant in spotting threats that others might miss. In this case, Chingachgook notices the unnatural mist and blacker smoke indicating the fire on the islet before anyone else does, underlining his essential role as a valuable member of the party. His caution is crucial for their safe passage through the narrows of the lake and avoiding potential confrontations with hostile forces." />
    <node id=" In this narrative, there is a tense moment in a canoe chase during a battle where Uncas and Chingachgook, both Native American warriors, display different reactions to the danger they face. The context of the scene involves their enemies, who are also Native Americans, shooting at them with guns from other canoes. However, due to the motion of the canoe and the inaccuracy of their enemies' aim, they struggle to hit their targets. Hawkeye, a skilled scout, deliberately waits for a clear shot before firing his rifle, while their enemies fire many shots that miss.&#10;&#10;Uncas, a young warrior, shows amazement at the willingness of Duncan and Munro to expose themselves to such danger. Meanwhile, Chingachgook, a more experienced warrior, remains focused on steering the canoe with a riveted look, unfazed by the gunfire around him. The enemies' shots are described as being less about accuracy and more about making noise.&#10;&#10;Later, when they see signs of danger, such as a thin streak of mist rising above an islet with blacker smoke hanging along its lower side, it's Chingachgook who first notices the unnatural mist and points it out to the scout. This shows how skilled and vigilant they are in detecting danger.&#10;&#10;In summary, during a tense moment in a canoe chase amidst a battle, Uncas displays amazement while Chingachgook remains calm and focused, demonstrating their differing reactions to danger based on their experience and skill level. Chingachgook's quick observation of danger highlights the importance of situational awareness in survival situations." />
    <node id="The Huron's gun fell into the water because, in the confusion and stress of the chase, he was startled by Hawkeye's shot that struck and incapacitated the Huron in the bow of their canoe. This shock caused him to lose his grip on his own gun, and it slipped out of his hands into the lake.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook had a few large drops of blood trickling down his shoulder during the canoe chase because Hawkeye's shot, which hit the Huron in the other canoe, had also grazed Chingachgook's shoulder. Despite this injury, Chingachgook did not make any sound or reveal his pain, as he knew that it was crucial for their survival in such a dangerous moment to remain calm and focused on the task at hand." />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye points out a small black object several miles away to Heyward, which he asks Heyward to identify. According to the narrative, this object is most likely a person or group of people, as Hawkeye refers to his &quot;white experience&quot; and the fact that they are traveling through Montcalm's army's camp. The small black object could therefore be French soldiers, who were known to be allied with Indian forces during the French and Indian War. The significance of this observation is that it confirms Hawkeye's suspicion that they are in enemy territory and must exercise extreme caution in order to avoid detection and ensure their safety." />
    <node id="Ḥawkeye's behavior changes during the pursuit based on his observation that a man who talks too much neglects to train his legs properly. This suggests that he believes Heyward has been talking excessively, and therefore may not be physically prepared for the rigors of the chase. In response, Ḥawkeye sets a rapid pace that compels Heyward and Munro to exert themselves to keep up. They also change their route to follow the bottom land, which had previously been used by the Hurons but is now easier to navigate due to the absence of efforts to conceal their tracks. However, as time passes, Ḥawkeye's head movements become more suspicious, indicating that he is becoming aware of potential dangers or approaching enemies. This change in behavior suggests that Ḥawkeye is taking measures to ensure the safety of the group while also maintaining a steady pace during the pursuit." />

These mysterious movements make Duncan feel alarmed and uneasy, as he is unable to understand what might be happening in this Native American settlement.">

First, Uncas has identified a fresh trail left by an animal or person, which the scout confirms as a canoe paddled by &quot;fierce and crafty Mingos&quot; (Huron warriors). The scout seems knowledgeable and experienced in tracking, able to interpret signs that others might miss, such as the impression of a foot on a bunch of moss. He also demonstrates an awareness of the dangers of being pursued, recognizing that the Hurons will likely follow their trail once it gets dark.&#10;&#10;The party follows the trail along a rill until they reach a dry rock, where they pause to make sure the Hurons haven't left the water. Uncas then discovers a fresh footprint in the neighboring thicket, which leads them to an earthen fort. The scout advises his companions to step on stones and fragments of wood as they clamber through the ruins surrounding the fort, suggesting that he is aware of the importance of leaving no trace for their pursuers.&#10;&#10;Once they reach the other side of the fort, the scout declares that the trail is now invisible to all but those with a keen sense of smell. He dashes forward confidently, and soon after, Uncas locates the tracks of the horses that the party had been following before. The scout interprets this as a sign that they have entered enemy territory, and that the horses' riders may have abandoned them to move more quickly on foot. Overall, the scout's observations suggest that he is confident in his ability to track the Hurons and navigate the wilderness, while also recognizing the dangers that pursuers can pose.">

Hawkeye notes that they have &quot;white man's courage&quot; and deliberate about finding cover in a skirmish, rather than standing out in the open.&#10;&#10;Later in the narrative, after Duncan and the others come across signs of their enemies on horseback, they continue to increase their distance from the enemy by following Uncas' lead and hurrying their departure. Hawkeye advises Heyward not to fire his rifle unless he sees him in danger, as their presence and the authority of Colonel Munro should be sufficient protection against the anger of their allies.">

According to the narrative, this object is most likely a person or group of people, as Hawkeye refers to his &quot;white experience&quot; and the fact that they are traveling through Montcalm's army's camp. The small black object could therefore be French soldiers, who were known to be allied with Indian forces during the French and Indian War. The significance of this observation is that it confirms Hawkeye's suspicion that they are in enemy territory and must exercise extreme caution in order to avoid detection and ensure their safety.">

This suggests that he believes Heyward has been talking excessively, and therefore may not be physically prepared for the rigors of the chase. In response, Ḥawkeye sets a rapid pace that compels Heyward and Munro to exert themselves to keep up. They also change their route to follow the bottom land, which had previously been used by the Hurons but is now easier to navigate due to the absence of efforts to conceal their tracks. However, as time passes, Ḥawkeye's head movements become more suspicious, indicating that he is becoming aware of potential dangers or approaching enemies.

Their rigid features express neither hope nor alarm. Hawkeye, the scout, explains that this is because the enemies, who are Native American as well (Mingos or Hurons), struggle to calculate an accurate range for their bullets in a moving canoe. The canoe's motion makes it difficult for them to aim accurately, and they often need to reload after each shot, slowing down their rate of fire. Hawkeye also notes that these enemies seem to value the sound of their guns more than their accuracy. In contrast, Hawkeye deliberately waits for a clearer shot, only firing when he is satisfied with the range and his ability to hit the target.">

The context of the scene involves their enemies, who are also Native Americans, shooting at them with guns from other canoes. However, due to the motion of the canoe and the inaccuracy of their enemies' aim, they struggle to hit their targets. Hawkeye, a skilled scout, deliberately waits for a clear shot before firing his rifle, while their enemies fire many shots that miss.&#10;&#10;Uncas, a young warrior, shows amazement at the willingness of Duncan and Munro to expose themselves to such danger. Meanwhile, Chingachgook, a more experienced warrior, remains focused on steering the canoe with a riveted look, unfazed by the gunfire around him. The enemies' shots are described as being less about accuracy and more about making noise.&#10;&#10;Later, when they see signs of danger, such as a thin streak of mist rising above an islet with blacker smoke hanging along its lower side, it's Chingachgook who first notices the unnatural mist and points it out to the scout. This shows how skilled and vigilant they are in detecting danger.&#10;&#10;In summary, during a tense moment in a canoe chase amidst a battle, Uncas displays amazement while Chingachgook remains calm and focused, demonstrating their differing reactions to danger based on their experience and skill level. Chingachgook's quick observation of danger highlights the importance of situational awareness in survival situations.">

However, Heyward does mention that there is a difference between Montcalm ordering a regiment of soldiers to physically stand between the Hurons and the prisoners, and trying to persuade an angry savage to forget their desire for revenge with words. This suggests that Heyward believes Montcalm's influence over the Hurons may have limits, particularly when it comes to situations where the Hurons are driven by strong emotions such as anger or a desire for revenge. Additionally, Heyward's comment that Montcalm will have to settle the matter with his God implies that he sees the massacre as a moral failure on Montcalm's part, possibly due to an inability or unwillingness to exercise enough control over his Huron allies.">

The canoe's motion makes it difficult for them to aim accurately, and they often need to reload after each shot, slowing down their rate of fire. Hawkeye also notes that these enemies seem to value the sound of their guns more than their accuracy. In contrast, Hawkeye deliberately waits for a clearer shot, only firing when he is satisfied with the range and his ability to hit the target.">

The context of the scene involves their enemies, who are also Native Americans, shooting at them with guns from other canoes. However, due to the motion of the canoe and the inaccuracy of their enemies' aim, they struggle to hit their targets. Hawkeye, a skilled scout, deliberately waits for a clear shot before firing his rifle, while their enemies fire many shots that miss.&#10;&#10;Uncas, a young warrior, shows amazement at the willingness of Duncan and Munro to expose themselves to such danger. Meanwhile, Chingachgook, a more experienced warrior, remains focused on steering the canoe with a riveted look, unfazed by the gunfire around him. The enemies' shots are described as being less about accuracy and more about making noise.&#10;&#10;Later, when they see signs of danger, such as a thin streak of mist rising above an islet with blacker smoke hanging along its lower side, it's Chingachgook who first notices the unnatural mist and points it out to the scout. This shows how skilled and vigilant they are in detecting danger.&#10;&#10;In summary, during a tense moment in a canoe chase amidst a battle, Uncas displays amazement while Chingachgook remains calm and focused, demonstrating their differing reactions to danger based on their experience and skill level. Chingachgook's quick observation of danger highlights the importance of situational awareness in survival situations.">

His efforts were seconded by those of the Mohicans, and a&#10;very few minutes served to place such a sheet of water between them and&#10;their enemies, that Heyward once more breathed freely.&#10;&#10;The lake now began to expand, and their route lay along a wide reach,&#10;that was lined, as before, by high and ragged mountains.

    <edge source=" After Munro demands his children back, Hawkeye, Duncan, and the Mohicans make efforts to increase their distance from the enemy by continuing to paddle and maintain their speed in the canoe. Despite having just been through an intense chase, they are able to do this because the motion of the canoe makes it difficult for their enemies to aim accurately, and the enemies seem to value the sound of their guns more than their accuracy. Hawkeye deliberately waits for a clear shot before firing his rifle, while the enemies fire many shots that miss their target.&#10;&#10;After they reach the lake and begin to paddle away from their enemies, they continue to maintain their pace by keeping their strokes measured and regular. The Mohicans, Chingachgook and Uncas, show no emotion during the chase and do not appear disturbed by the enemy's gunfire, as they are skilled at finding cover and avoiding bullets. Hawkeye notes that they have &quot;white man's courage&quot; and deliberate about finding cover in a skirmish, rather than standing out in the open.&#10;&#10;Later in the narrative, after Duncan and the others come across signs of their enemies on horseback, they continue to increase their distance from the enemy by following Uncas' lead and hurrying their departure. Hawkeye advises Heyward not to fire his rifle unless he sees him in danger, as their presence and the authority of Colonel Munro should be sufficient protection against the anger of their allies." target=" In this narrative, there is a tense moment in a canoe chase during a battle where Uncas and Chingachgook, both Native American warriors, display different reactions to the danger they face. The context of the scene involves their enemies, who are also Native Americans, shooting at them with guns from other canoes. However, due to the motion of the canoe and the inaccuracy of their enemies' aim, they struggle to hit their targets. Hawkeye, a skilled scout, deliberately waits for a clear shot before firing his rifle, while their enemies fire many shots that miss.&#10;&#10;Uncas, a young warrior, shows amazement at the willingness of Duncan and Munro to expose themselves to such danger. Meanwhile, Chingachgook, a more experienced warrior, remains focused on steering the canoe with a riveted look, unfazed by the gunfire around him. The enemies' shots are described as being less about accuracy and more about making noise.&#10;&#10;Later, when they see signs of danger, such as a thin streak of mist rising above an islet with blacker smoke hanging along its lower side, it's Chingachgook who first notices the unnatural mist and points it out to the scout. This shows how skilled and vigilant they are in detecting danger.&#10;&#10;In summary, during a tense moment in a canoe chase amidst a battle, Uncas displays amazement while Chingachgook remains calm and focused, demonstrating their differing reactions to danger based on their experience and skill level. Chingachgook's quick observation of danger highlights the importance of situational awareness in survival situations.">

    <edge source="The adventurers in the narrative might face several dangers as they travel in the narrows of the lake. Given their suspicion that Montcalm may have left some Indians in ambush along this passage, there is a risk of encountering hostile forces lying in wait to attack. The discovery of an enemy fire on the islet, indicated by the thin streak of mist and blacker smoke, further confirms this danger. The presence of Hurons or French enemies nearby increases the vulnerability of the party, making caution essential for their survival.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook is especially cautious during this part of the journey because he has a keen sense of observation and experience in identifying signs of danger. His Native American background and knowledge of enemy tactics make him more vigilant in spotting threats that others might miss. In this case, Chingachgook notices the unnatural mist and blacker smoke indicating the fire on the islet before anyone else does, underlining his essential role as a valuable member of the party. His caution is crucial for their safe passage through the narrows of the lake and avoiding potential confrontations with hostile forces." target="The Huron's gun fell into the water because, in the confusion and stress of the chase, he was startled by Hawkeye's shot that struck and incapacitated the Huron in the bow of their canoe. This shock caused him to lose his grip on his own gun, and it slipped out of his hands into the lake.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook had a few large drops of blood trickling down his shoulder during the canoe chase because Hawkeye's shot, which hit the Huron in the other canoe, had also grazed Chingachgook's shoulder. Despite this injury, Chingachgook did not make any sound or reveal his pain, as he knew that it was crucial for their survival in such a dangerous moment to remain calm and focused on the task at hand.">

    <node id="Becky Crawley, also known as Rebecca Sharp, is a complex character who exhibits various subtle vices throughout the story. She is described as manipulative, deceitful, and socially ambitious, often using her charm and wit to get what she wants. Becky's actions are usually driven by her desire for wealth, status, and security.&#10;&#10;In this particular narrative, some of the subtle vices displayed by Becky include:&#10;&#10;1. Social climbing: Despite being rejected from the hotel due to her questionable reputation, Becky continues trying to make a name for herself and conquer scandal. She associates with people who can help further her social status.&#10;2. Duplicity: Becky receives acquaintances such as Major Loder and Captain Rook, whom she might have known from less reputable circles. Her interactions with them are likely not entirely innocent.&#10;3. Hypocrisy: Although the landlord is initially respectful to her, Becky notes that he calls her &quot;Madame&quot; one day but has become impolite to her the next. Despite experiencing similar treatment herself, she does not correct her acquaintances who follow suit and snub Amelia in Ostend.&#10;4. Exploitation: Becky takes advantage of Amelia's kindness and forgiveness by sharing a house with her at Ostend. Although Amelia has no idea about the disdain others show for Becky, she embraces and kisses her old friend without hesitation, which shows how Becky exploits Amelia's naivety.&#10;5. Manipulation: Becky deceives Jos Sedley by telling him a &quot;neat, simple, and artless&quot; story about her past with George Osborne. She convinces him that she had never encouraged George and that her heart had first learned to beat at Jos' presence. This manipulative tale helps repair her relationship with Jos.&#10;&#10;Regarding the author's reminders about propriety and decorum, yes, he does emphasize these aspects when describing Becky. The author, William Makepeace Thackeray, uses irony to address his readers directly, pointing out that although there are questionable actions taking place in Vanity Fair, polite society would prefer not to discuss them openly. By doing this, Thackeray acknowledges the existence of such vices while trying to maintain a light and agreeable tone throughout the story. This approach is meant to ensure that readers' &quot;fine feelings may not be offended.&quot;" />
    <node id=" it has been the wish of the present writer, all through&#10;this story, deferentially to submit to the fashion at present&#10;prevailing, and only to hint at the existence of wickedness in a light,&#10;easy, and agreeable manner, so that nobody's fine feelings may be&#10;offended.  I defy any one to say that our Becky, who has certainly some&#10;vices, has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and&#10;inoffensive manner.  In describing this Siren, singing and smiling,&#10;coaxing and cajoling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers&#10;all round, has he once forgotten the laws of politeness, and showed the&#10;monster's hideous tail above water? No!  Those who like may peep down&#10;under waves that are pretty transparent and see it writhing and&#10;twirling, diabolically hideous and slimy, flapping amongst bones, or&#10;curling round corpses; but above the waterline, I ask, has not&#10;everything been proper, agreeable, and decorous, and has any the most&#10;squeamish immoralist in Vanity Fair a right to cry fie? When, however,&#10;the Siren disappears and dives" />

And she&#10;heard Beaumoris's laugh ringing on the stair and knew quite well how to&#10;interpret his hilarity.&#10;&#10;It was after this visit that Becky, who had paid her weekly bills,&#10;Becky who had made herself agreeable to everybody in the house, who&#10;smiled at the landlady, called the waiters &quot;monsieur,&quot; and paid the&#10;chambermaids in politeness and apologies, what far more than&#10;compensated for a little niggardliness in point of money (of which&#10;Becky never was free), that Becky, we say, received a notice to quit&#10;from the landlord, who had been told by some one that she was quite an&#10;unfit person to have at his hotel, where English ladies would not sit&#10;down with her.  And she was forced to fly into lodgings of which the&#10;dulness and solitude were most wearisome to her.&#10;&#10;Still she held up, in spite of these rebuffs, and tried to make a&#10;character for herself and conquer scandal" />
    <node id="&#10;A Vagabond Chapter&#10;&#10;We must pass over a part of Mrs. Rebecca Crawley's biography with that&#10;lightness and delicacy which the world demands--the moral world, that&#10;has, perhaps, no particular objection to vice, but an insuperable&#10;repugnance to hearing vice called by its proper name. There are things&#10;we do and know perfectly well in Vanity Fair, though we never speak of&#10;them:  as the Ahrimanians worship the devil, but don't mention him:&#10;and a polite public will no more bear to read an authentic description&#10;of vice than a truly refined English or American female will permit the&#10;word breeches to be pronounced in her chaste hearing.  And yet, madam,&#10;both are walking the world before our faces every day, without much&#10;shocking us.  If you were to blush every time they went by, what&#10;complexions you would have!  It is only when their naughty names are&#10;called out that your modesty has any occasion to show alarm or sense of&#10;outrage, and it has been the wish of the present writer, all through&#10;this story, deferentially to submit to the fashion at present&#10;prevailing, and only" />

Becky took down her elephant and put it into&#10;the little box which she had had from Amelia ever so many years ago.&#10;Emmy also came off with her Lares--her two pictures--and the party,&#10;finally, were, lodged in an exceedingly dear and uncomfortable house at&#10;Ostend.&#10;&#10;There Amelia began to take baths and get what good she could from them,&#10;and though scores of people of Becky's acquaintance passed her and cut&#10;her, yet Mrs. Osborne, who walked about with her, and who knew nobody,&#10;was not aware of the treatment experienced by the friend whom she had&#10;chosen so judiciously as a companion; indeed, Becky never thought fit&#10;to tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes.&#10;&#10;Some of Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's acquaintances, however, acknowledged her&#10;readily enough,--perhaps more readily than she would have desired.&#10;Among those were Major Loder (unattached), and Captain Rook (late of&#10;the Rifles), who might be seen any day on the Dike, smoking and staring&#10;at the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable&#10;board and select circle" />

There stood Emmy in a tremble, and Dobbin, the tall Major,&#10;with his cane.&#10;&#10;He stood still watching, and very much interested at the scene; but&#10;Emmy sprang forward with open arms towards Rebecca, and forgave her at&#10;that moment, and embraced her and kissed her with all her heart. Ah,&#10;poor wretch, when was your lip pressed before by such pure kisses?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Amantium Irae&#10;&#10;Frankness and kindness like Amelia's were likely to touch even such a&#10;hardened little reprobate as Becky.  She returned Emmy's caresses and&#10;kind speeches with something very like gratitude, and an emotion which,&#10;if it was not lasting, for a moment was almost genuine" />

And she began,&#10;forthwith, to tell her story--a tale so neat, simple, and artless that&#10;it was quite evident from hearing her that if ever there was a&#10;white-robed angel escaped from heaven to be subject to the infernal&#10;machinations and villainy of fiends here below, that spotless&#10;being--that miserable unsullied martyr, was present on the bed before&#10;Jos--on the bed, sitting on the brandy-bottle.&#10;&#10;They had a very long, amicable, and confidential talk there, in the&#10;course of which Jos Sedley was somehow made aware (but in a manner that&#10;did not in the least scare or offend him) that Becky's heart had first&#10;learned to beat at his enchanting presence; that George Osborne had&#10;certainly paid an unjustifiable court to HER, which might account for&#10;Amelia's jealousy and their little rupture; but that Becky never gave&#10;the least encouragement to the unfortunate officer, and that she had&#10;never ceased" />
    <node id="After leaving the service, Colonel Dobbin rented a country place in Hampshire, not far from Queen's Crawley, where Sir Pitt and his family now resided constantly after the passing of the Reform Bill. The reform bill resulted in Sir Pitt losing his two seats in Parliament, which negatively affected his finances and spirits. He lamented the impending ruin of the Empire.&#10;&#10;Lady Jane and Mrs. Dobbin became close friends, and their children, George and Rawdon, also developed a friendship as they hunted, shot, studied at the same college, and later quarreled over Lady Jane's daughter.&#10;&#10;Dobbin's concern about Rebecca (Mrs. Crawley) centered around her being part of his friends' family despite being a lady separated from her husband. He knew that Lady O'Dowd still held affection for him and would even consider marrying one of his relatives if anything happened to her current husband, Major-General O'Dowd.&#10;&#10;After quitting the service, Dobbin was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel as Marshal Tiptoff died and Major-General O'Dowd received a rank advancement in his regiment during its return to England. Amelia had been informed about these movements through George's correspondence from Bengal, although Major Dobbin expressed displeasure and mistrust towards Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Joseph Sedley died at Aix-la-Chapelle, having squandered his wealth on unwise investments. The only assets he left were two thousand pounds for which his life was insured, equally divided between Amelia and Rebecca, who was referred to as Rebecca, wife of Lieutenant-Colonel Rawdon Crawley, C.B. Dobbin never saw Jos again after that encounter in which he expressed his forebodings about Rebecca." />
    <node id=", not&#10;far from Queen's Crawley, where, after the passing of the Reform Bill,&#10;Sir Pitt and his family constantly resided now. All idea of a Peerage&#10;was out of the question, the Baronet's two seats in Parliament being&#10;lost.  He was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that&#10;catastrophe, failed in his health, and prophesied the speedy ruin of&#10;the Empire.&#10;&#10;Lady Jane and Mrs. Dobbin became great friends--there was a perpetual&#10;crossing of pony-chaises between the Hall and the Evergreens, the&#10;Colonel's place (rented of his friend Major Ponto, who was abroad with&#10;his family).  Her Ladyship was godmother to Mrs. Dobbin's child, which&#10;bore her name, and was christened by the Rev. James Crawley, who&#10;succeeded his father in the living: and a pretty close friendship&#10;subsisted between the two lads, George and Rawdon, who hunted and shot&#10;together in the vacations, were both entered of the same college at&#10;Cambridge, and quarrelled with each other about Lady Jane's daughter,&#10;with whom they were both," />
    <node id=", &quot;do hear what Major&#10;Dobbin has to say against me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not hear it, I say,&quot; squeaked out Jos at the top of his voice,&#10;and, gathering up his dressing-gown, he was gone.&#10;&#10;&quot;We are only two women,&quot; Amelia said.  &quot;You can speak now, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This manner towards me is one which scarcely becomes you, Amelia,&quot; the&#10;Major answered haughtily; &quot;nor I believe am I guilty of habitual&#10;harshness to women.  It is not a pleasure to me to do the duty which I&#10;am come to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Pray proceed with it quickly, if you please, Major Dobbin,&quot; said&#10;Amelia, who was more and more in a pet.  The expression of Dobbin's&#10;face, as she spoke in this imperious manner, was not pleasant.&#10;&#10;&quot;I came to say--and as you stay, Mrs. Crawley, I must say it in your&#10;presence--that I think you--you ought not to form a member of the&#10;family of my friends.  A lady who is separated from her husband, who&#10;travels not under her own" />
    <node id="  Lady O'Dowd is also so attached to it that, she says, if&#10;anything were to happen to Mick, bedad she'd come back and marry some&#10;of 'em.  But the Major-General is quite well and lives in great&#10;splendour at O'Dowdstown, with a pack of beagles, and (with the&#10;exception of perhaps their neighbour, Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty) he&#10;is the first man of his county.  Her Ladyship still dances jigs, and&#10;insisted on standing up with the Master of the Horse at the Lord&#10;Lieutenant's last ball.  Both she and Glorvina declared that Dobbin had&#10;used the latter SHEAMFULLY, but Posky falling in, Glorvina was&#10;consoled, and a beautiful turban from Paris appeased the wrath of Lady&#10;O'Dowd.&#10;&#10;When Colonel Dobbin quitted the service, which he did immediately after&#10;his marriage, he rented a pretty little country place in Hampshire, not&#10;far from Queen's Crawley, where, after the passing of the Reform Bill,&#10;Sir Pitt and his family constantly resided now.

Almost&#10;directly after this, Dobbin's name appeared among the Lieutenant-Colonels:&#10;for old Marshal Tiptoff had died during the passage of the&#10;--th from Madras, and the Sovereign was pleased to advance Colonel Sir&#10;Michael O'Dowd to the rank of Major-General on his return to England,&#10;with an intimation that he should be Colonel of the distinguished&#10;regiment which he had so long commanded.&#10;&#10;Amelia had been made aware of some of these movements.

On the contrary, his&#10;excitement was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one; he made use of&#10;a brief but improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress,&#10;saying, in fact, &quot;The little minx, has she come to light again?&quot; He&#10;never had had the slightest liking for her, but had heartily mistrusted&#10;her from the very first moment when her green eyes had looked at, and&#10;turned away from, his own.&#10;&#10;&quot;That little devil brings mischief wherever she goes,&quot; the Major said&#10;disrespectfully.  &quot;Who knows what sort of life she has been leading?&#10;And what business has she here abroad and alone? Don't tell me about&#10;persecutors and enemies; an honest woman always has friends and never&#10;is separated from her family.  Why has she left her husband? He may&#10;have been disreputable and wicked, as you say.  He always was.  I&#10;remember the confounded blackleg and the way in which he used to cheat&#10;and hoodwink poor George.  Wasn't there a scandal about their&#10;separation? I think I heard something,&quot; cried out Major Dobbin, who did&#10;not care" />
    <node id=" anything, only he must have time: they mustn't say anything to Mrs.&#10;Crawley--she'd--she'd kill me if she knew it.  You don't know what a&#10;terrible woman she is,&quot; the poor wretch said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, why not come away with me?&quot; said Dobbin in reply; but Jos had&#10;not the courage.  &quot;He would see Dobbin again in the morning; he must on&#10;no account say that he had been there.  He must go now.  Becky might&#10;come in.&quot; And Dobbin quitted him, full of forebodings.&#10;&#10;He never saw Jos more.  Three months afterwards Joseph Sedley died at&#10;Aix-la-Chapelle.  It was found that all his property had been muddled&#10;away in speculations, and was represented by valueless shares in&#10;different bubble companies.  All his available assets were the two&#10;thousand pounds for which his life was insured, and which were left&#10;equally between his beloved &quot;sister Amelia, wife of, &amp;c., and his&#10;friend and invaluable attendant during sickness, Rebecca, wife of&#10;Lieutenant-Colonel Rawdon Crawley, C" />
    <node id="Becky's social situation is quite complex, as she is a part of various social circles but doesn't seem to fully belong to any. She lives in a Bohemian environment filled with traveling peddlers, gamblers, vaulters, tumblers, students, and others on the roof of a building. The text suggests that she has found her &quot;dirty little refuge&quot; among these diverse groups, who all seem to accept her despite her low status.&#10;&#10;Her living situation is within one of the small cabins on the rooftop of the building where she interacts with people from various social backgrounds, including students, bagmen, small tradesmen, and country-folks during festivals.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights how Becky has found her niche in this unique community despite being friendless, poor, and wretched. The building's structure includes several floors occupied by different groups, with Becky residing among the students and travelers on the rooftop. This environment is a stark contrast to Amelia's conventional life, reflecting Becky's character and her desire for constant stimulation and social interaction." />

She was at home with everybody in the place,&#10;pedlars, punters, tumblers, students and all. She was of a wild, roving&#10;nature, inherited from father and mother, who were both Bohemians, by&#10;taste and circumstance; if a lord was not by, she would talk to his&#10;courier with the greatest pleasure; the din, the stir, the drink, the&#10;smoke, the tattle of the Hebrew pedlars, the solemn, braggart ways of&#10;the" />

The atrocious monster!&#10;&#10;This part of her eventful history Becky gave with the utmost feminine&#10;delicacy and the most indignant virtue. Forced to fly her husband's&#10;roof by this insult, the coward had pursued his revenge by taking her&#10;child from her. And thus Becky said she was a wanderer, poor,&#10;unprotected, friendless, and wretched.&#10;&#10;Emmy received this story, which was told at some length, as those&#10;persons who are acquainted with her character may imagine that she&#10;would.  She quivered with indignation at the account of the conduct of&#10;the miserable Rawdon and the unprincipled Steyne.  Her eyes made notes&#10;of admiration for every one of the sentences in which Becky described&#10;the persecutions of her aristocratic relatives and the falling away of&#10;her husband.

It was the&#10;same routine every day, the same dulness and comfort, the same drive&#10;over the same stupid Bois de Boulogne, the same company of an evening,&#10;the same Blair's Sermon of a Sunday night--the same opera always being&#10;acted over and over again; Becky was dying of weariness, when, luckily&#10;for her, young Mr. Eagles came from Cambridge, and his mother, seeing&#10;the impression which her little friend made upon him, straightway gave&#10;Becky warning.&#10;&#10;Then she tried keeping house with a female friend; then the double&#10;menage began to quarrel and get into debt.  Then she determined upon a&#10;boarding-house existence and lived for some time at that famous mansion&#10;kept by Madame de Saint Amour, in the Rue Royale, at Paris, where she&#10;began exercising her graces and fascinations upon the shabby dandies&#10;and fly-blown beauties who frequented her landlady's salons.  Becky&#10;loved society and, indeed, could no more exist without it than an&#10;opium-eater without his dram, and she was happy enough at the period of" />

The actions of&#10;very vain, heartless, pleasure-seeking people are very often improper&#10;(as are many of yours, my friend with the grave face and spotless&#10;reputation--but that is merely by the way); and what are those of a&#10;woman without faith--or love--or character? And I am inclined to think&#10;that there was a period in Mrs Becky's life when she was seized, not by&#10;remorse, but by a kind of despair, and absolutely neglected her person&#10;and did not even care for her reputation.&#10;&#10;This abattement and degradation did not take place all at once; it was&#10;brought about by degrees, after her calamity, and after many struggles&#10;to keep up--as a man who goes overboard hangs on to a spar whilst any&#10;hope is left, and then flings it away and goes down, when he finds that&#10;struggling is in vain.&#10;&#10;She lingered about London whilst her husband was making preparations&#10;for his departure to his seat of government, and it is believed made&#10;more than one attempt to see her brother-in-" />

And the two gentlemen were laying their heads together and&#10;consulting as to the best means of being useful to Mrs. Becky, while&#10;she was finishing her interrupted dejeuner a la fourchette.&#10;&#10;How was it that she had come to that little town?

This included information about her father, mother, previous history, and alleged misconduct.&#10;3. Rebecca attempted to see or write to Pitt at his own house but eventually conceded to his demand for correspondence only through lawyers.&#10;4. Lady Jane interposed and showed spirit in disowning Rebecca, inviting Rawdon to stay with her until his departure for Coventry Island to prevent any attempts by Rebecca to force her door.&#10;5. Lady Jane also kept a watchful eye on letters arriving for Sir Pitt, lest he and Rebecca were corresponding. &#10;&#10;These factors collectively strained Rebecca's relationship with Sir Pitt Crawley, while Wenham's biased account significantly contributed to the deterioration of their ties by damaging her reputation in Sir Pitt's esteem." />

A short&#10;time after Lord Steyne's accident Wenham had been with the Baronet and&#10;given him such a biography of Mrs. Becky as had astonished the member&#10;for Queen's Crawley.  He knew everything regarding her: who her father&#10;was; in what year her mother danced at the opera; what had been her&#10;previous history; and what her conduct during her married life--as I&#10;have no doubt that the greater part of the story was false and dictated&#10;by interested malevolence, it shall not be repeated here.

She sneaked away when her eyes met those of&#10;Wenham, and indeed never succeeded in her designs upon the Baronet.&#10;&#10;Probably Lady Jane interposed.  I have heard that she quite astonished&#10;her husband by the spirit which she exhibited in this quarrel, and her&#10;determination to disown Mrs. Becky.  Of her own movement, she invited&#10;Rawdon to come and stop in Gaunt Street until his departure for&#10;Coventry Island, knowing that with him for a guard Mrs. Becky would not&#10;try to force her door; and she looked curiously at the superscriptions&#10;of all the letters which arrived for Sir Pitt, lest he and his&#10;sister-in-law should be corresponding.

A part&#10;of them were set aside by his Excellency for the payment of certain&#10;outstanding debts and liabilities, the charges incident on his high&#10;situation required considerable expense; finally, it was found that he&#10;could not spare to his wife more than three hundred pounds a year,&#10;which he proposed to pay to her on an undertaking that she would never&#10;trouble him. Otherwise, scandal, separation, Doctors' Commons would&#10;ensue.  But it was Mr. Wenham's business, Lord Steyne's business,&#10;Rawdon's, everybody's--to get her out of the country, and hush up a&#10;most disagreeable affair.&#10;&#10;She was probably so much occupied in arranging these affairs of&#10;business with her husband's lawyers that she forgot to take any step&#10;whatever about her son, the little Rawdon, and did not even once&#10;propose to go and see him.

But she never did for a year afterwards, and&#10;not, indeed, until Sir Pitt's only boy, always sickly, died of&#10;hooping-cough and measles--then Rawdon's mamma wrote the most&#10;affectionate composition to her darling son, who was made heir of&#10;Queen's Crawley by this accident, and drawn more closely than ever to&#10;the kind lady, whose tender heart had already adopted him.  Rawdon&#10;Crawley, then grown a tall, fine lad, blushed when he got the letter.&#10;&quot;Oh, Aunt Jane, you are my mother!&quot; he said; &quot;and not--and not that&#10;one.&quot; But he wrote back a kind and respectful letter to Mrs. Rebecca" />

    <node id="Becky Sharp's grief over her son Rawdon is primarily a performance, a way for her to manipulate the emotions of others and gain their sympathy. She provides a detailed and dramatic story of her husband's betrayal and the loss of her child, which Emmy, Mrs. Alderney, and even the Eagles family believe. Becky exploits their feelings of pity and indignation, presenting herself as an innocent victim and her husband as the villain.&#10;&#10;She further manipulates them by sharing partial information about her son, such as describing his appearance vaguely or claiming to have a drawing of him, which she will show later. This tactic keeps the interest alive and makes people more inclined to believe her story. Becky also uses her charm and emotional appeals, such as weeping over children who resemble her Rawdon in age or appearance, to win over influential figures like Mrs. Alderney and the Eagles family.&#10;&#10;In reality, Becky's grief over her son is questionable, as she readily admits that her sorrow has made her forget many things, including his exact age.

    <node id="The woman in the text, Becky Crawley, develops a fascination for disreputable behavior, leading her to embrace a Bohemian lifestyle and associate with English raffs involved in diverse criminal activities throughout Europe. This fascination likely stems from her desire for excitement, social interaction, and liberation from societal conventions.&#10;&#10;Becky's life among the traveling peddlers, gamblers, vaulters, tumblers, students, and other eccentric individuals on the rooftop of a building offers her an unconventional community where she can find acceptance despite her low status. This environment is far removed from Amelia's traditional lifestyle, reflecting Becky's personality and her quest for continuous stimulation.&#10;&#10;Becky's association with the English raffs, as described in the supporting materials, results from her growing taste for disreputable behavior.

The&#10;correspondence between George and his guardian had not ceased by any&#10;means:  William had even written once or twice to her since his&#10;departure, but in a manner so unconstrainedly cold that the poor woman&#10;felt now in her turn that she had lost her power over him and that, as&#10;he had said, he was free.  He had left her, and she was wretched.  The&#10;memory of his almost countless services, and lofty and affectionate&#10;regard, now presented itself to her and rebuked her day and night.  She&#10;brooded over those recollections according to her wont, saw the purity&#10;and beauty of the affection with which she had trifled, and reproached&#10;herself for having flung away such a treasure.&#10;&#10;It was gone indeed.  William had spent it all out.  He loved her no&#10;more, he thought, as he had loved her. He never could again.  That sort&#10;of regard, which he had proffered to her for so many faithful years,&#10;can't be flung down and shattered and mended so as" />

You did yesterday. You know you&#10;did.  And I will never forgive you.  Never!&quot; said Amelia.  She shot out&#10;each little sentence in a tremor of anger and emotion.&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't mean that, Amelia?&quot; William said sadly. &quot;You don't mean that&#10;these words, uttered in a hurried moment, are to weigh against a whole&#10;life's devotion? I think that George's memory has not been injured by&#10;the way in which I have dealt with it, and if we are come to bandying&#10;reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the mother of his&#10;son.  Reflect, afterwards when--when you are at leisure, and your&#10;conscience will withdraw this accusation.  It does even now.&quot; Amelia&#10;held down her head.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not that speech of yesterday,&quot; he continued, &quot;which moves you.&#10;That is but the pretext, Amelia, or" />

She was&#10;murmuring something about--forgive--dear William--dear, dear, dearest&#10;friend--kiss, kiss, kiss, and so forth--and in fact went on under the&#10;cloak in an absurd manner.&#10;&#10;When Emmy emerged from it, she still kept tight hold of one of&#10;William's hands, and looked up in his face.  It was full of sadness and&#10;tender love and pity.  She understood its reproach and hung down her&#10;head.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was time you sent for me, dear Amelia,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;You will never go again, William?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, never,&quot; he answered, and pressed the dear little soul once more to&#10;his heart.&#10;&#10;As they issued out of the custom-house precincts, Georgy broke out on&#10;them, with his telescope up to his eye, and a loud laugh of welcome; he&#10;danced round" />

I have watched your struggle.  Let it end.  We are&#10;both weary of it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia stood scared and silent as William thus suddenly broke the chain&#10;by which she held him and declared his independence and superiority.&#10;He had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little woman&#10;had been accustomed to trample upon him.  She didn't wish to marry him,&#10;but she wished to keep him.  She wished to give him nothing, but that&#10;he should give her all.  It is a bargain not unfrequently levied in&#10;love.&#10;&#10;William's sally had quite broken and cast her down. HER assault was&#10;long since over and beaten back.&#10;&#10;&quot;Am I to understand then, that you are going--away, William?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;He gave a sad laugh.  &quot;I went once before,&quot; he said, &quot;and came back&#10;after twelve years.  We were young then, Amelia.  Good-bye." />
    <node id="Means were easily found to win the favour of Georgy and the servants.&#10;Amelia's maid, it has been said, was heart and soul in favour of the&#10;generous Major.  Having at first disliked Becky for being the means of&#10;dismissing him from the presence of her mistress, she was reconciled to&#10;Mrs. Crawley subsequently, because the latter became William's most&#10;ardent admirer and champion.  And in those nightly conclaves in which&#10;the two ladies indulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne was&#10;&quot;brushing their 'airs,&quot; as she called the yellow locks of the one and&#10;the soft brown tresses of the other, this girl always put in her word&#10;for that dear good gentleman Major Dobbin.  Her advocacy did not make&#10;Amelia angry any more than Rebecca's admiration of him.  She made&#10;George write to him constantly and persisted in sending Mamma's kind&#10;love in a postscript.  And as she looked at her husband's portrait of&#10;nights, it no longer reproached her--perhaps she reproached it, now&#10;William was gone.&#10;&#10;Emmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice.

When it was over, and Georgy had rejoined his&#10;parents, Mrs. Becky returned (just for a few days) to comfort the&#10;solitary bachelor, Joseph Sedley.

    <node id="Becky's mischievous act when she let Jos into her room involved setting up a scene to create the impression that she was receiving improper visits from men. She quickly hid a rouge-pot, a brandy bottle, and a plate of broken meat under her bed before letting him in. She did this to make Jos believe that she was entertaining another man in her room, thus creating drama and further ingratiating herself to him. This act allowed Becky to manipulate Jos' emotions and strengthen her hold on him, as he became increasingly concerned for her welfare and more willing to help her financially." />

She lighted on Jos.  &quot;It's you,&quot;&#10;she said, coming out.  &quot;How I have been waiting for you!  Stop! not&#10;yet--in one minute you shall come in.&quot; In that instant she put a&#10;rouge-pot, a brandy bottle, and a plate of broken meat into the bed,&#10;gave one smooth to her hair, and finally let in her visitor.&#10;&#10;She had, by way of morning robe, a pink domino, a trifle faded and&#10;soiled, and marked here and there" />

It was he&#10;indeed, blooming in youth and beauty, in a nankeen jacket of the cut of&#10;1804.  It was the old picture that used to hang up in Russell Square.&#10;&#10;&quot;I bought it,&quot; said Becky in a voice trembling with emotion; &quot;I went to&#10;see if I could be of any use to my kind friends.  I have never parted&#10;with that picture--I never will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Won't you?&quot; Jos cried with a look of unutterable rapture and&#10;satisfaction.  &quot;Did you really now value it for my sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know I did, well enough,&quot; said Becky; &quot;but why speak--why&#10;think--why look back!

She showed her displeasure through an unjust and scornful glance before bidding him farewell with a killing curtsey.&#10;&#10;2. After leaving Major Dobbin's presence, Emmy reflected upon the truth that she was displaying injustice, especially by weak people, when performing an act. This realization came as she thought about her hasty behavior and decision to be angry with the Major." />

Emmy went up and embraced her guest with the greatest&#10;warmth, and took no notice of the Major, except to fling him an angry&#10;look--the most unjust and scornful glance that had perhaps ever&#10;appeared in that poor little woman's face since she was born.  But she&#10;had private reasons of her own, and was bent upon being angry with him.&#10;And Dobbin, indignant at the injustice, not at the defeat, went off,&#10;making her a bow quite as haughty as the killing curtsey with which the&#10;little woman chose to bid him farewell.&#10;&#10;He being gone, Emmy was particularly lively and affectionate to&#10;Rebecca, and bustled about the apartments and installed her guest in&#10;her room with an eagerness and activity seldom exhibited by our placid&#10;little friend.

    <node id="Amelia was prompted to take the decision of writing a letter to a friend in urgency due to her growing discomfort and fear caused by the inappropriate behavior of the Captain, Major, and two ruffians. These men were paying her tipsy compliments, making unwanted advances, and leering at her, which made her feel terrified and threatened. She also did not want to be alone with any of these men, including the Major who had sworn to win her over. In addition, she felt horror and uneasiness in the presence of the ruffians, although she was not aware of their malicious intentions towards her. Therefore, Amelia decided to write a letter to a friend, seeking help and support in this difficult situation." />
    <node id=" that of his friend inspired the little lady&#10;with intolerable terror and aversion.  They paid her tipsy compliments;&#10;they leered at her over the dinner-table.  And the Captain made her&#10;advances that filled her with sickening dismay, nor would she ever see&#10;him unless she had George by her side.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, to do her justice, never would let either of these men remain&#10;alone with Amelia; the Major was disengaged too, and swore he would be&#10;the winner of her. A couple of ruffians were fighting for this innocent&#10;creature, gambling for her at her own table, and though she was not&#10;aware of the rascals' designs upon her, yet she felt a horror and&#10;uneasiness in their presence and longed to fly.&#10;&#10;She besought, she entreated Jos to go.  Not he.

She wrote&#10;off a letter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water, a&#10;letter about which she did not speak a word to anybody, which she&#10;carried herself to the post under her shawl; nor was any remark made&#10;about it, only that she looked very much flushed and agitated when&#10;Georgy met her, and she kissed him, and hung over him a great deal that&#10;night.  She did not come out of her room after her return from her&#10;walk. Becky thought it was Major Loder and the Captain who frightened&#10;her.&#10;&#10;&quot;She mustn't stop here,&quot; Becky reasoned with herself. &quot;She must go&#10;away, the silly little fool.

Her persecutions ought to be&#10;ended: she ought to return to the society of which she was an ornament.&#10;He would see what ought to be done.

    <node id="1. Mr. Harley, also known as Major Dobbin, failed to persuade Mr. Sedley to keep Rebecca out of his household because he was not &quot;less violent or more dexterous&quot; in making his supplications. He approached the matter with too much emotion and energy, which may have overwhelmed or alienated Mr. Sedley.&#10;2. Another factor could be that Mr. Sedley is a &quot;quiet gentleman who was ordinarily not in the habit of showing great energy.&quot; Thus, he might have been uncomfortable or skeptical of Dobbin's passionate appeal and insistent tone.&#10;3. Furthermore, Dobbin's request to Sedley may have been overshadowed by Joseph's fear of Rebecca's temper and manipulative behavior, as well as his hesitation to break off the connection with her.&#10;4. Lastly, the fact that Amelia, Mr. Sedley's daughter, was fond of Rebecca might have also made it more difficult for Dobbin to convince Mr. Sedley of Rebecca's unfitness as a companion for his family." />

He besought Mr. Sedley to inquire at least&#10;regarding her; told him how he had heard that she was in the company of&#10;gamblers and people of ill repute; pointed out what evil she had done&#10;in former days, how she and Crawley had misled poor George into ruin,&#10;how she was now parted from her husband, by her own confession, and,&#10;perhaps, for good reason.  What a dangerous companion she would be for&#10;his sister, who knew nothing of the affairs of the world!  William&#10;implored Jos, with all the eloquence which he could bring to bear, and&#10;a great deal more energy than this quiet gentleman was ordinarily in&#10;the habit of showing, to keep Rebecca out of his household.&#10;&#10;Had he been less violent, or more dexterous, he might have succeeded in&#10;his supplications to Jos; but the civilian was not a" />

When he returned to his lodgings all the&#10;lights in the Sedley tenement were put out.  He could not see her till&#10;the morning.  I don't know what sort of a night's rest he had with this&#10;frightful secret in bed with him.&#10;&#10;At the earliest convenient hour in the morning he sent his servant&#10;across the way with a note, saying that he wished very particularly to&#10;speak with her.  A message came back to say that Mrs. Osborne was&#10;exceedingly unwell and was keeping her room.&#10;&#10;She, too, had been awake all that night.

    <node id="Becky showing Jos her portrait and revealing that she had kept it all this time signified several things. Firstly, it served as a sentimental reminder of their past connection, rekindling Jos' emotions and deepening his attachment to her. Secondly, it demonstrated Becky's cunning manipulation skills, as she exploited Jos' vanity and concern for her welfare to strengthen her hold on him. By presenting the portrait as a cherished possession that reminded her of their shared history, she successfully evoked Jos' protective instincts and made him more willing to assist her financially.&#10;&#10;In this narrative excerpt from William Makepeace Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Becky Sharp uses various tactics to ingratiate herself with Jos Sedley, whom she has not seen in years. Through the revelation of the portrait, their conversation, and her clever manipulation of her living space, she successfully appeals to Jos' emotions, convinces him of her innocence, and ultimately ensures his financial support.&#10;&#10;In addition, when compared to the supporting materials provided, this action is consistent with Becky's character as an opportunistic social climber who exploits connections to improve her own standing in society. Displaying the portrait also evokes Jos' memories of their past connection, which further endears him to her and increases his willingness to help her financially." />
    <node id="  What a comfort it&#10;is amongst strangers to see once more the frank honest face of an old&#10;friend!&quot;&#10;&#10;The frank honest face, to tell the truth, at this moment bore any&#10;expression but one of openness and honesty:  it was, on the contrary,&#10;much perturbed and puzzled in look.  Jos was surveying the queer little&#10;apartment in which he found his old flame.  One of her gowns hung over&#10;the bed, another depending from a hook of the door; her bonnet obscured&#10;half the looking-glass, on which, too, lay the prettiest little pair of&#10;bronze boots; a French novel was on the table by the bedside, with a&#10;candle, not of wax.  Becky thought of popping that into the bed too,&#10;but she only put in the little paper night-cap with which she had put&#10;the candle out on going to sleep.&#10;&#10;&quot;I should have known you anywhere,&quot; she continued; &quot;a woman never&#10;forgets some things.

The Colonel did not want to see Rebecca and met Jos privately in his rooms. Jos was in a state of pitiable infirmity and was both afraid of and eager to praise Rebecca. Despite Jos's assurance that Rebecca was innocent, the Colonel urged him to break off the disreputable connection with her and return to his family in England. The Colonel believed that Jos's affairs were involved, but Jos insisted that all his money was placed out advantageously. However, the Colonel discovered that Jos had taken out a life insurance policy, which made him suspect that Jos was in debt.

Mrs. Crawley, who had her carriage, gave entertainments,&#10;and lived in a very genteel manner, occupied another suite of&#10;apartments in the same hotel.&#10;&#10;The Colonel, of course, did not desire to see that lady, or even think&#10;proper to notify his arrival at Brussels, except privately to Jos by a&#10;message through his valet.

Jos and his fair guest had a charming&#10;tete-a-tete, and his sister could hear, as she lay awake in her&#10;adjoining chamber, Rebecca singing over to Jos the old songs of 1815.&#10;He did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, any more than Amelia.&#10;&#10;It was June, and, by consequence, high season in London; Jos, who read&#10;the incomparable Galignani (the exile's best friend) through every day,&#10;used to favour the ladies with extracts from his paper during their&#10;breakfast.  Every week in this paper there is a full account of&#10;military movements, in which Jos, as a man who had seen service, was&#10;especially interested.  On one occasion he read out--&quot;Arrival of the&#10;--th regiment.

    <node id="Outside the lodgings, preparations are being made for Major William's departure on a journey. The horses are being put to his carriage, which he had bought for six pounds sterling. His servant, Francis, is bringing out the portmanteaus (large traveling bags) and Kunz, the one-eyed postilion, is arriving with three schimmels (a breed of horse). Major William's landlord, Old Burcke, is also present as Francis brings out more packages, which are described as final packages. Major William himself then comes out, and it is mentioned that Burcke wanted to kiss him, but he had to escape from the demonstration of attachment. It is also noted that Georgy's package, which Becky had given him, was passed on to the Major in the carriage. Emmy, who is inside the lodgings with Georgy and Jos, gives a little start at the sight of the preparations but does not say anything initially. When questioned by Georgy about the Major's departure, she confirms that he is &quot;not coming back.&quot;" />

He had&#10;rushed down the stairs and flung across the street in a minute--the&#10;yellow postilion was cracking his whip gently.&#10;&#10;William had got into the carriage, released from the embraces of his&#10;landlord.  George bounded in afterwards, and flung his arms round the&#10;Major's neck (as they saw from the window), and began asking him&#10;multiplied questions.  Then he felt in his waistcoat pocket and gave&#10;him a note.

The baggage was strapped on.  Francis came out&#10;with his master's sword, cane, and umbrella tied up together, and laid&#10;them in the well, and his desk and old tin cocked-hat case, which he&#10;placed under the seat.  Francis brought out the stained old blue cloak&#10;lined with red camlet, which had wrapped the owner up any time these&#10;fifteen years, and had manchen Sturm erlebt, as a favourite song of&#10;those days said.

And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind&#10;him, it is a fact that Georgy, rummaging his mother's desk some time&#10;afterwards, found the gloves neatly folded up and put away in what they&#10;call the secret-drawers of the desk.&#10;&#10;Not caring for society, and moping there a great deal, Emmy's chief&#10;pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with Georgy&#10;(during which Rebecca was left to the society of Mr. Joseph), and then&#10;the mother and son used to talk about the Major in a way which even&#10;made the boy smile.

    <node id="1. Becky Crawley has a complex social situation and lives in a Bohemian environment with traveling peddlers, gamblers, vaulters, tumblers, students, and others on the rooftop of a building. She is friendless, poor, and wretched but has found acceptance among these diverse groups.&#10;&#10;2. Becky is fascinated by disreputable behavior and associates with English raffs involved in criminal activities throughout Europe, such as drinking, swaggering, fighting, brawling, running away without paying debts, cheating at cards, and deceiving Jewish bankers. Her morally questionable behavior includes gambling, drinking, borrowing money from a Minister, and coaxing or flirting with men for financial gain.&#10;&#10;3. The text suggests that Becky experienced a period of despair and neglected her person and reputation after a calamity. She lingered in London while her husband was making preparations for his departure to Coventry and attempted to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, but eventually conceded to carrying on correspondence only through lawyers.&#10;&#10;4. Lady Jane interposed and disowned Becky, inviting Rawdon to stay with her until his departure for Coventry Island to prevent any attempts by Rebecca to force her door. Wenham gave Sir Pitt a biased and mostly false account of Rebecca's past and her conduct during married life, poisoning his mind against her and significantly contributing to the deterioration of their ties.&#10;&#10;5. The mystery surrounding Becky's reputation in society is that she has a sad sad reputation in the esteem of Sir Pitt Crawley due to Wenham's biased account, which included information about her father, mother, previous history, and alleged misconduct. This significantly strained Rebecca's relationship with Sir Pitt Crawley." />

It was just such a little select&#10;banquet as that of which Becky recollected that she had partaken at&#10;Lord Steyne's--and there he sat at Polonia's table, and she saw him.&#10;The scar cut by the diamond on his white, bald, shining forehead made a&#10;burning red mark; his red whiskers were dyed of a purple hue, which&#10;made his" />

    <node id="Becky Sharp, a manipulative character, tells Emmy a dramatic story about being driven to demand a separation from her husband, Rawdon Crawley. According to Becky, their marriage was always viewed negatively by his family, and his affections were estranged due to his forming &quot;odious connections.&quot; She highlights that she bore poverty, neglect, and coldness from Rawdon for the sake of their child. Eventually, Rawdon asked her to sacrifice her own reputation to secure advancement through the Marquis of Steyne, an unprincipled man. This request led Becky to demand a separation. After leaving Rawdon's roof, he took their child away from her, leaving Becky in a state of poverty, without protection, and with few friends.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that Becky's account of her past is likely manipulated to elicit sympathy from Emmy and others. She paints herself as an innocent victim while presenting Rawdon as the villain. By sharing partial information about her son, such as vaguely describing his appearance or claiming to have a drawing of him, she keeps people interested and makes them more likely to believe her story. Becky's grief over her son may be performative, with her primary motivation being personal gain rather than genuine concern for his well-being." />

She has a soft and foolish disposition, which makes her heart melt towards anyone who is unhappy. Despite this, she has not developed a strong abhorrence for wickedness, indicating that she may be somewhat naive or overly trusting.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Amelia is also shown to value loyalty and faithfulness in relationships, as evidenced by her regret over losing William's deep affection. She had taken his love for granted and even trifled with it, leading to his departure. Now, she deeply regrets her actions and cannot forgive herself for having let go of such a treasure.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mrs. Amelia is depicted as being strong-willed and assertive when necessary. This is shown in her interactions with Major Dobbin, where she stands up to him despite his haughty demeanor and insists that he proceed with the duty he has come to do. Overall, Mrs. Amelia is a complex character who is both kind and assertive, forgiving and strong-willed." />

She does this to create the impression that she is innocent and respectable, despite the suspicious surroundings.

    <node id="1. After the Curzon Street catastrophe, Becky Crawley went through a period of despair and neglect for her person and reputation. She lingered in London while her husband was preparing to leave for his government seat and tried to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, but eventually agreed to correspond only through lawyers.&#10;&#10;2. During this time, Becky's behavior became increasingly questionable. She associated with disreputable English ruffians involved in criminal activities throughout Europe and engaged in morally ambiguous actions such as gambling, drinking, borrowing money from a Minister, and coaxing or flirting with men for financial gain.&#10;&#10;3. Becky's behavior after the Curzon Street catastrophe was complex and often improper, involving deceitful activities, dubious associations, and disregard for societal norms. Therefore, providing a comprehensive account of her actions during this period might lead some to deem the book improper due to its explicit depiction of such behavior." />

    <node id="Mrs. Miller, formerly Becky Sharp, felt angry and humiliated during her time in Boulogne due to the behavior of both men and women towards her. The men in Boulogne would insult her, which she found intolerable. However, what drove her &quot;almost wild with rage&quot; was the patronizing attitude of certain women, such as Mrs. Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington White, who were traveling with their husbands and children to Switzerland. These women giggled, cackled, tattled, condoled, consoled, and simpered at her, treating her with a level of sympathy that she found demeaning and offensive.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Miller's response to this treatment was to win over the sympathies of other women by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting frantic grief when his name was mentioned. She did this so effectively that she gained the heart of Mrs. Alderney, the Queen of British Boulogne, who gave dinners and balls for the residents there. However, her behavior also led to conflict with Major Dobbin, who disapproved of her forming a member of the family of his friends due to the scandal surrounding her separation from her husband, Mr. Rawdon Crawley. Despite Jos's defense of Mrs. Miller, Major Dobbin insisted on consulting Emmy, whom he considered a good judge of character, regarding whether this woman ought to be visited or not." />

Mrs. Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington&#10;White passed through Boulogne on their way to Switzerland.  The party&#10;were protected by Colonel Horner, young Beaumoris, and of course old&#10;Crackenbury, and Mrs. White's little girl.

She&#10;passed her time chiefly in grumbling, in ordering about her mistress,&#10;and in stating her intention to return the next morning to her native&#10;village of Clapham.  &quot;She may have Payne's room,&quot; Emmy said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you don't mean to say you are going to have that woman into the&#10;house?&quot; bounced out the Major, jumping up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course we are,&quot; said Amelia in the most innocent way in the world.&#10;&quot;Don't be angry and break the furniture, Major Dobbin.

    <node id="based on the passage provided, it appears that Amelia's maid, Becky Sharp (Mrs. Crawley), does not directly influence Amelia's feelings towards Major Dobbin. However, Becky's presence and actions do have an impact on their relationship.&#10;&#10;Before William's departure, Becky had warned Amelia about Major Dobbin's intentions and advised her to be cautious in her interactions with him. This may have contributed to Amelia's initial distance from the Major after William's death.&#10;&#10;After William's departure, Becky continues to be a presence in Amelia's life, living with her and influencing her decisions. When Major Dobbin comes to speak with Amelia about his concerns regarding Becky's character and influence, Amelia is resistant to his intervention, likely due in part to her loyalty to and trust in Becky.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Becky does not directly influence Amelia's feelings towards Major Dobbin, her presence and actions do affect their relationship dynamics." />

Despite Mrs. de Rawdon's humble origins, she was invited to these prestigious events due to her half-year's salary being paid into the principal banker's there, making her eligible for such invitations. The Polonias themselves had a lineage of both royal and common beginnings, with the princess being of the family of Pompili, lineally descended from the second king of Rome, while the prince's grandfather sold wash-balls, essences, tobacco, and pocket-handkerchiefs, ran errands for gentlemen, and lent money in a small way." />
    <node id="&#10;It happened at Rome once that Mrs. de Rawdon's half-year's salary had&#10;just been paid into the principal banker's there, and, as everybody who&#10;had a balance of above five hundred scudi was invited to the balls&#10;which this prince of merchants gave during the winter, Becky had the&#10;honour of a card, and appeared at one of the Prince and Princess&#10;Polonia's splendid evening entertainments. The Princess was of the&#10;family of Pompili, lineally descended from the second king of Rome, and&#10;Egeria of the house of Olympus, while the Prince's grandfather,&#10;Alessandro Polonia, sold wash-balls, essences, tobacco, and&#10;pocket-handkerchiefs, ran errands for gentlemen, and lent money in a&#10;small way.  All the great company in Rome thronged to his&#10;saloons--Princes, Dukes, Ambassadors, artists, fiddlers, monsignori,&#10;young bears with their leaders--every rank and condition of man. His&#10;halls blazed with light and magnificence; were resplendent with gilt&#10;frames (containing pictures), and dubious antiques; and the enormous&#10;" />

When she&#10;got her money she gambled; when she had gambled it she was put to&#10;shifts to live; who knows how or by what means she succeeded? It is&#10;said that she was once seen at St.  Petersburg, but was summarily&#10;dismissed from that capital by the police, so that there cannot be any&#10;possibility of truth in the report that she was a Russian spy at&#10;Toplitz and Vienna afterwards.  I have even been informed that at Paris&#10;she discovered a relation of her own, no less a person than her&#10;maternal grandmother, who was not by any means a Montmorenci, but a&#10;hideous old box-opener at a theatre on the Boulevards.  The meeting&#10;between them, of which other persons, as it is hinted elsewhere, seem&#10;to have been acquainted, must have been a very affecting interview.&#10;The present historian can give no certain details regarding the event.&#10;&#10;It happened at Rome once that Mrs. de Rawdon's half-year's salary had&#10;just been paid into the principal banker's there, and," />

This led her to give him an unjust and scornful glance before bidding him farewell with a killing curtsey.&#10;2. After Major Dobbin left, Emmy realized that she had acted unjustly, especially towards someone weak like him. Despite this realization, she chose to be angry with him and show extra affection towards Rebecca by bustling around and installing her guest in her room with great eagerness. This behavior was likely due to her private reasons for being jealous of Rebecca and her desire to defend her friend." />
    <node id="Major Dobbin visits Amelia and Jos's home because he wants to discuss his disapproval of Rebecca's presence in their household. He believes that as a friend of the family, it is his duty to express his concerns. Rebecca, on the other hand, encourages him to speak against her in front of Amelia and Jos, perhaps to clear the air or to demonstrate her confidence in her own innocence. Alternatively, she may be trying to manipulate the situation to her advantage by appearing blameless and putting the blame on others. It is also possible that she wants to use this opportunity to mend her relationship with Amelia, who has been jealous of Rebecca in the past." />
    <node id="Based on Major Dobbin's past experiences and interactions with the woman in distress, Rebecca Sharp (Mrs. Crawley), it is clear that he does not hold her in high regard. He has previously expressed his disapproval of Amelia allowing Rebecca to become a member of her household, stating that he thinks she &quot;ought not to form a member of the family of my friends&quot; due to her questionable character and being separated from her husband.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Major Dobbin visits Amelia and Jos's home in the passage provided, he is explicitly there to discuss his concerns about Rebecca's presence in their household. He believes that as a friend of the family, it is his duty to express his objections to Amelia. Rebecca, on the other hand, seemingly encourages him to speak against her in front of Amelia and Jos, perhaps to clear the air or to demonstrate her confidence in her own innocence. However, Major Dobbin's negative opinion of Rebecca is further solidified by his refusal to believe Jos's claims that she is a virtuous female and his suggestion to consult Emmy on the matter, knowing that she will likely share his views on Rebecca's character." />
    <edge source="Becky Crawley, also known as Rebecca Sharp, is a complex character who exhibits various subtle vices throughout the story. She is described as manipulative, deceitful, and socially ambitious, often using her charm and wit to get what she wants. Becky's actions are usually driven by her desire for wealth, status, and security.&#10;&#10;In this particular narrative, some of the subtle vices displayed by Becky include:&#10;&#10;1. Social climbing: Despite being rejected from the hotel due to her questionable reputation, Becky continues trying to make a name for herself and conquer scandal. She associates with people who can help further her social status.&#10;2. Duplicity: Becky receives acquaintances such as Major Loder and Captain Rook, whom she might have known from less reputable circles. Her interactions with them are likely not entirely innocent.&#10;3. Hypocrisy: Although the landlord is initially respectful to her, Becky notes that he calls her &quot;Madame&quot; one day but has become impolite to her the next. Despite experiencing similar treatment herself, she does not correct her acquaintances who follow suit and snub Amelia in Ostend.&#10;4. Exploitation: Becky takes advantage of Amelia's kindness and forgiveness by sharing a house with her at Ostend. Although Amelia has no idea about the disdain others show for Becky, she embraces and kisses her old friend without hesitation, which shows how Becky exploits Amelia's naivety.&#10;5. Manipulation: Becky deceives Jos Sedley by telling him a &quot;neat, simple, and artless&quot; story about her past with George Osborne. She convinces him that she had never encouraged George and that her heart had first learned to beat at Jos' presence. This manipulative tale helps repair her relationship with Jos.&#10;&#10;Regarding the author's reminders about propriety and decorum, yes, he does emphasize these aspects when describing Becky. The author, William Makepeace Thackeray, uses irony to address his readers directly, pointing out that although there are questionable actions taking place in Vanity Fair, polite society would prefer not to discuss them openly. By doing this, Thackeray acknowledges the existence of such vices while trying to maintain a light and agreeable tone throughout the story. This approach is meant to ensure that readers' &quot;fine feelings may not be offended.&quot;" target=" it has been the wish of the present writer, all through&#10;this story, deferentially to submit to the fashion at present&#10;prevailing, and only to hint at the existence of wickedness in a light,&#10;easy, and agreeable manner, so that nobody's fine feelings may be&#10;offended.  I defy any one to say that our Becky, who has certainly some&#10;vices, has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and&#10;inoffensive manner.  In describing this Siren, singing and smiling,&#10;coaxing and cajoling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers&#10;all round, has he once forgotten the laws of politeness, and showed the&#10;monster's hideous tail above water? No!  Those who like may peep down&#10;under waves that are pretty transparent and see it writhing and&#10;twirling, diabolically hideous and slimy, flapping amongst bones, or&#10;curling round corpses; but above the waterline, I ask, has not&#10;everything been proper, agreeable, and decorous, and has any the most&#10;squeamish immoralist in Vanity Fair a right to cry fie?

Firstly, it served as a sentimental reminder of their past connection, rekindling Jos' emotions and deepening his attachment to her. Secondly, it demonstrated Becky's cunning manipulation skills, as she exploited Jos' vanity and concern for her welfare to strengthen her hold on him. By presenting the portrait as a cherished possession that reminded her of their shared history, she successfully evoked Jos' protective instincts and made him more willing to assist her financially.&#10;&#10;In this narrative excerpt from William Makepeace Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Becky Sharp uses various tactics to ingratiate herself with Jos Sedley, whom she has not seen in years. Through the revelation of the portrait, their conversation, and her clever manipulation of her living space, she successfully appeals to Jos' emotions, convinces him of her innocence, and ultimately ensures his financial support.&#10;&#10;In addition, when compared to the supporting materials provided, this action is consistent with Becky's character as an opportunistic social climber who exploits connections to improve her own standing in society. Displaying the portrait also evokes Jos' memories of their past connection, which further endears him to her and increases his willingness to help her financially.">

Additionally, Tapeworm's revelations led Major Dobbin to propose that he and Amelia go to consult with Mrs. George Osborne, Amelia's sister-in-law, about the matter, thinking that Emmy would support his opinion that Becky should not be visited or welcomed into their social circle.&#10;5. The surprise and concern caused by Tapeworm's revelations led Major Dobbin to take decisive action and express his strong disapproval of Amelia's association with Becky Sharp, despite Amelia's initial anger and resistance to his intervention.">

These women giggled, cackled, tattled, condoled, consoled, and simpered at her, treating her with a level of sympathy that she found demeaning and offensive.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Miller's response to this treatment was to win over the sympathies of other women by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting frantic grief when his name was mentioned. She did this so effectively that she gained the heart of Mrs. Alderney, the Queen of British Boulogne, who gave dinners and balls for the residents there. However, her behavior also led to conflict with Major Dobbin, who disapproved of her forming a member of the family of his friends due to the scandal surrounding her separation from her husband, Mr. Rawdon Crawley.

Despite Mrs. de Rawdon's humble origins, she was invited to these prestigious events due to her half-year's salary being paid into the principal banker's there, making her eligible for such invitations. The Polonias themselves had a lineage of both royal and common beginnings, with the princess being of the family of Pompili, lineally descended from the second king of Rome, while the prince's grandfather sold wash-balls, essences, tobacco, and pocket-handkerchiefs, ran errands for gentlemen, and lent money in a small way.">

Mr. Harley, also known as Major Dobbin, failed to persuade Mr. Sedley to keep Rebecca out of his household because he was not &quot;less violent or more dexterous&quot; in making his supplications. He approached the matter with too much emotion and energy, which may have overwhelmed or alienated Mr. Sedley.&#10;2. Another factor could be that Mr. Sedley is a &quot;quiet gentleman who was ordinarily not in the habit of showing great energy.&quot; Thus, he might have been uncomfortable or skeptical of Dobbin's passionate appeal and insistent tone.&#10;3. Furthermore, Dobbin's request to Sedley may have been overshadowed by Joseph's fear of Rebecca's temper and manipulative behavior, as well as his hesitation to break off the connection with her.&#10;4. Lastly, the fact that Amelia, Mr. Sedley's daughter, was fond of Rebecca might have also made it more difficult for Dobbin to convince Mr. Sedley of Rebecca's unfitness as a companion for his family.">

Her morally questionable behavior includes gambling, drinking, borrowing money from a Minister, and coaxing or flirting with men for financial gain.&#10;&#10;3. The text suggests that Becky experienced a period of despair and neglected her person and reputation after a calamity. She lingered in London while her husband was making preparations for his departure to Coventry and attempted to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, but eventually conceded to carrying on correspondence only through lawyers.&#10;&#10;4. Lady Jane interposed and disowned Becky, inviting Rawdon to stay with her until his departure for Coventry Island to prevent any attempts by Rebecca to force her door. Wenham gave Sir Pitt a biased and mostly false account of Rebecca's past and her conduct during married life, poisoning his mind against her and significantly contributing to the deterioration of their ties.&#10;&#10;5. The mystery surrounding Becky's reputation in society is that she has a sad sad reputation in the esteem of Sir Pitt Crawley due to Wenham's biased account, which included information about her father, mother, previous history, and alleged misconduct. This significantly strained Rebecca's relationship with Sir Pitt Crawley.">

This may have contributed to Amelia's initial distance from the Major after William's death.&#10;&#10;After William's departure, Becky continues to be a presence in Amelia's life, living with her and influencing her decisions. When Major Dobbin comes to speak with Amelia about his concerns regarding Becky's character and influence, Amelia is resistant to his intervention, likely due in part to her loyalty to and trust in Becky.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Becky does not directly influence Amelia's feelings towards Major Dobbin, her presence and actions do affect their relationship dynamics.">

She has a soft and foolish disposition, which makes her heart melt towards anyone who is unhappy. Despite this, she has not developed a strong abhorrence for wickedness, indicating that she may be somewhat naive or overly trusting.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Amelia is also shown to value loyalty and faithfulness in relationships, as evidenced by her regret over losing William's deep affection. She had taken his love for granted and even trifled with it, leading to his departure. Now, she deeply regrets her actions and cannot forgive herself for having let go of such a treasure.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mrs. Amelia is depicted as being strong-willed and assertive when necessary. This is shown in her interactions with Major Dobbin, where she stands up to him despite his haughty demeanor and insists that he proceed with the duty he has come to do. Overall, Mrs. Amelia is a complex character who is both kind and assertive, forgiving and strong-willed.">

The men in Boulogne would insult her, which she found intolerable. However, what drove her &quot;almost wild with rage&quot; was the patronizing attitude of certain women, such as Mrs. Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington White, who were traveling with their husbands and children to Switzerland. These women giggled, cackled, tattled, condoled, consoled, and simpered at her, treating her with a level of sympathy that she found demeaning and offensive.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Miller's response to this treatment was to win over the sympathies of other women by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting frantic grief when his name was mentioned. She did this so effectively that she gained the heart of Mrs. Alderney, the Queen of British Boulogne, who gave dinners and balls for the residents there. However, her behavior also led to conflict with Major Dobbin, who disapproved of her forming a member of the family of his friends due to the scandal surrounding her separation from her husband, Mr. Rawdon Crawley. Despite Jos's defense of Mrs. Miller, Major Dobbin insisted on consulting Emmy, whom he considered a good judge of character, regarding whether this woman ought to be visited or not.">

Her morally questionable behavior includes gambling, drinking, borrowing money from a Minister, and coaxing or flirting with men for financial gain.&#10;&#10;3.

She lingered in London while her husband was making preparations for his departure to Coventry and attempted to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, but eventually conceded to carrying on correspondence only through lawyers.&#10;&#10;4. Lady Jane interposed and disowned Becky, inviting Rawdon to stay with her until his departure for Coventry Island to prevent any attempts by Rebecca to force her door. Wenham gave Sir Pitt a biased and mostly false account of Rebecca's past and her conduct during married life, poisoning his mind against her and significantly contributing to the deterioration of their ties.&#10;&#10;5.

Becky's behavior after the Curzon Street catastrophe was complex and often improper, involving deceitful activities, dubious associations, and disregard for societal norms.

According to Becky, their marriage was always viewed negatively by his family, and his affections were estranged due to his forming &quot;odious connections.&quot; She highlights that she bore poverty, neglect, and coldness from Rawdon for the sake of their child. Eventually, Rawdon asked her to sacrifice her own reputation to secure advancement through the Marquis of Steyne, an unprincipled man. This request led Becky to demand a separation. After leaving Rawdon's roof, he took their child away from her, leaving Becky in a state of poverty, without protection, and with few friends.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that Becky's account of her past is likely manipulated to elicit sympathy from Emmy and others. She paints herself as an innocent victim while presenting Rawdon as the villain. By sharing partial information about her son, such as vaguely describing his appearance or claiming to have a drawing of him, she keeps people interested and makes them more likely to believe her story. Becky's grief over her son may be performative, with her primary motivation being personal gain rather than genuine concern for his well-being.">

    <node id="1. The new schools categorization system in Wales uses improvement boards to identify and support schools based on their level of need, with &quot;red&quot; schools entitled to 25 days of support, more than was provided under the Schools Challenge Cymru program.&#10;2. This system allows for a more focused approach by targeting resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, unlike the previous program that only supported secondary schools.&#10;3. By incorporating well-being into the national mission, the new system addresses various challenges faced by children within the school setting, ensuring they receive the necessary support to remain in school.&#10;4. The categorization system identifies schools based on their needs and provides intensive support to help them make improvements, with examples of Schools Challenge Cymru schools sustaining progress even after the program has ended.&#10;5. The Welsh Government is taking steps to improve the PDG agenda at a regional level by appointing new regional PDG advisers to ensure individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for and doing, promoting good practice regionally." />
    <node id=" feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme, which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr, in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gru" />
    <node id="'ve got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: And investment in well-being—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Absolutely. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission—to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We're going to move on to Schools Challenge Cymru now. Llyr.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I was just wondering what your assessment is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-se" />
    <node id=", very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. Some schools had very, very different needs. I think, talking to those involved in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Yes, okay—&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Sorry. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Leadership is all.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again—gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut" />
    <node id=" able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members—you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG—because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record—can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance," />
    <node id=" for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, you would recognise the findings from that research.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there" />
    <node id="1. Role of schools and regional consortia in providing PDG support for looked-after children: Schools are responsible for using PDG funds to provide support for looked-after children, while regional consortia play a role in improving the use of these funds through regionalization and collaboration. In 2015, it was decided that PDG for looked-after children would be regionalized, meaning regional consortia would have a more significant role in providing support to schools.&#10;2. Less awareness about PDG's availability for looked-after children: There is less awareness about PDG's availability for looked-after children because there are fewer looked-after children compared to those eligible for free school meals. Additionally, the focus has historically been on free school meals due to their higher numbers.&#10;&#10;The lower number of looked-after children and the regionalization of PDG support contribute to less awareness about its availability for this group. It is essential to improve communication and understanding of PDG's role in supporting looked-after children, so that schools and consortia can effectively use these funds to narrow the attainment gap for this vulnerable group." />
    <node id="less AM&#10;Content: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey—only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder—can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. I think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around PDG is around free school meals. There is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. So, I think that's part of the explanation. A decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise PDG for looked-after children. My understanding was that" />
    <node id=" improvement work. It's crucial.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths" />
    <node id="'m just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees—pupils who are eligible for free school meals.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Llyr. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to—in challenge advisers' discussions in schools—we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts." />
    <node id=" wanted to add, Steve.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: There is also another very good example—and I take what you say about where there are small numbers—but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Thank you. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency" />
    <node id=" difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. It still is an extraordinary difference. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. When people were absent, a lot of the—. As I'm sure you're aware, there's a huge connection. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older" />
    <node id="The speaker, Kirsty Williams AM, acknowledges the discrepancy between her statement and Estyn's report regarding the effective use of the PDG by schools. She suggests that the use of PDG is evolving over time and more schools are understanding how to best deploy the money for effect. She emphasizes the importance of leadership within individual schools in making good use of the PDG.&#10;&#10;In order to improve the effectiveness of PDG usage, Kirsty Williams AM mentions the appointment of new PDG regional advisers whose role is to spread good practice across regions and ensure that PDG is used strategically and consistently across all schools. She also stresses the need for evidence that PDG is being used earlier in a child's career, rather than just before exams.&#10;&#10;Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of PDG usage, there needs to be a focus on leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Additionally, there should be measures in place to demonstrate that PDG is being used properly and that good practice is being shared across regions. The new PDG regional advisers are expected to play a crucial role in this regard." />
    <node id=" that only two thirds of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it—that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. Of course, that's being developed in a different work stream. I think what's fair to say is that the use of PDG is evolving over time. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about" />
    <node id=" you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that it is being used properly?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're—&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Oh, the eligibility. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. So, that's there to provide strategic overall advice. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers" />
    <node id=", say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say, 'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.'&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We've—&#10;Speaker: Ruth Conway&#10;Content: Sorry—I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition, and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that 'the majority of schools are making well thought out and appropriate decisions' on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not" />
    <node id=": Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance, but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. They call at homes for children, and they walk the children to the breakfast club. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said," />
    <node id="1. Appointment of new PDG regional advisers: These advisers are tasked with spreading good practice regarding PDG usage across regions, ensuring strategic and consistent use of PDG in all schools. They will provide overall advice on the effective deployment of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;2. Strengthening the role of regional challenge advisers: Regional challenge advisers will work closely with individual schools to challenge their use of PDG. This includes examining how PDG is being targeted, the programs it is spent on, and whether there is an evidence base for its use and a clear impact on student learning.&#10;&#10;3. Promoting good practice regionally: Regional advisers will ensure that school challenge advisers are aware of best practices in using PDG, especially in targeting and spending decisions. They will encourage schools to adopt these strategies to maximize the effectiveness of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;4. Ensuring evidence-based use of PDG: Estyn recognizes that PDG is being used to support more able and talented students, but there is a need for strategic deployment across all schools. Regional advisers will work with schools to ensure that PDG usage is both strategic and evidence-based.&#10;&#10;5. Emphasizing leadership within individual schools: Effective use of PDG relies on strong leadership within schools. Regional advisers will encourage and support school leaders in making informed decisions about PDG spending, ensuring it is used appropriately and effectively to support student learning.&#10;&#10;6. Encouraging early intervention: To maximize the impact of PDG, regional advisers will emphasize the importance of early intervention strategies. This means using PDG funds earlier in a child's career, rather than just before exams, to provide support and address learning needs proactively.&#10;&#10;7. Monitoring and demonstrating proper use of PDG: Regional advisers will ensure that measures are in place to demonstrate that PDG is being used appropriately and consistently across schools. This will involve assessing the impact of PDG spending on student outcomes and making adjustments as needed." />
    <node id=" PDG is used in the appropriate way. So, that's there to provide strategic overall advice. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that we've got at present. And we will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways. We have to be mindful. Some of the policy" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is currently no specific system in place in Wales for sharing information between social services and schools regarding adopted children, similar to what is happening in England. However, there is an ongoing discussion about the possibility of creating a dataset where this information can be shared voluntarily by parents. The speakers also acknowledge the importance of making adoptive parents feel that they can discuss their child's adoption with school leaders and teachers, in order to provide the necessary support for the child and encourage parental engagement. There is an agreement on the need to balance the importance of this information sharing with the need to respect the privacy of families and not force them to disclose sensitive information if they do not wish to. Overall, there seems to be a consensus that more effort should be made to make parents of adopted children in schools aware of the potential benefits of sharing this information, but it should be done in a way that is sensitive to the needs and privacy of these families." />
    <node id=" doubt an element of PDG for looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a better position to learn. So, again, this is an example of how vulnerable learners in the wider sense can benefit.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Mark, did you have anything you wanted to ask?&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Yes. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data. Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted" />
    <node id="Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. You're absolutely right. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support—even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas—. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying, 'Actually, this will mean more money for" />
    <node id=" an impact for that child. So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Julie's got some more questions on the impact on adopted and looked-after children.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. So, I just wanted to really reinforce that.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, and" />
    <node id=" there was an awareness in the school. So, I just wanted to really reinforce that.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: No, but they need to be given the opportunity.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, you're right. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again—and I've said this a lot—after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. Thank you. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data" />
    <node id=" will look at that. I think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. I just think we need to be a bit mindful of people's privacy in some instances. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family, 'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.'&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Michelle.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Fair enough; thank you for that answer. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part" />

    <node id="1. Strong, capable school leadership is crucial for driving change within the education system. This was a key lesson learned from the three-year investment in school leadership.&#10;2. Newly appointed headteachers can contribute significantly to the speed at which schools engage with improvement efforts, as seen in a significant minority of schools with recent appointments.&#10;3. The Government is applying these lessons by focusing on systems and processes, teacher quality, and collaborative activity in their wider school improvement program, the national mission.&#10;4. Expertise from the Schools Challenge Cymru program has been integrated into regional consortia to benefit all schools, not just a small proportion.&#10;5. The Government recognizes that there is always room for improvement and is strengthening the role of regional PDG advisers to ensure individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for and doing, with a regional approach to good practice." />

I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give" />
    <node id=". So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school? We're looking at the teacher quality—how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity—again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools. So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools—but that expertise is available to all our schools.&#10;Speaker: L" />
    <node id=", Cabinet Secretary.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him, Owen Evans has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. So, there has been an ongoing dialogue. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you—and I'm absolutely confident—is that we have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia—. So, the lessons, I am confident, have been learnt.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: I'm glad to" />
    <node id=" also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia. It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong," />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams AM, acknowledges the concern about the apparent blurring of eligibility for the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) and its distribution beyond those eligible for free school meals. However, she also highlights that the PDG is being used appropriately in terms of providing strategic overall advice and challenging schools on their use of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;When asked if eligibility for free school meals is the best measure to identify which pupils to target, Kirsty Williams admits that it may not be perfect but is the best available proxy for need at present. She also mentions ongoing discussions with local government about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need.&#10;&#10;Steve Davies adds that PDG funds are being used effectively in some secondary schools to employ resources like school nurses and counsellors, which benefit not just the children but their families as well. This demonstrates a wider use of PDG funds beyond simply targeting those eligible for free school meals.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there may be some discomfort with the apparent blurring of eligibility and wider distribution of PDG funds, the Cabinet Secretary for Education recognizes the importance of flexible and responsive funding to address the needs of pupils in Wales." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members who are present if they wish to declare any interests? Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our final evidence session for our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Bore da. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals" />
    <node id=" now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, we're certainly giving thought to flexibility. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able" />
    <node id="1. Professor Ainscow feels that he has more to contribute to the process of improving education in Wales, particularly in regards to entrenching the lessons learned from the Schools Challenge Cymru program within the regional consortia.&#10;2. He specifically mentions the success of Schools Challenge Cymru in recruiting high-quality individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, and suggests that there is more to learn about how to support real excellence and diversity in recruitment for these positions within the regional consortia.&#10;3. It is implied that Professor Ainscow feels that he could provide valuable insights and suggestions on this topic, as he has a deep understanding of the Schools Challenge Cymru program and its successes.&#10;4. The Cabinet Secretary, Kirsty Williams AM, has acknowledged that there is always room for improvement in how the Welsh Government supports regional consortia, and has stated that she is open to seeking improvements in this area. It is possible that inviting Professor Ainscow in for a further debriefing could provide valuable insights and suggestions on how to improve recruitment and diversity within the regional consortia." />
    <node id="ortia—. So, the lessons, I am confident, have been learnt.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about? Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government" />
    <node id=" Reckless AM&#10;Content: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia. I just wonder, Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: I'm not characterising it that way, Cabinet Secretary.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him, O" />
    <node id=" and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We had the evaluation of the programme. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to the regional consortia. We've spoken to local education authorities. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. So, a wide variety of people have been involved in those conversations.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow—with Professor Ainscow himself.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: I would actually say that I have had meetings—&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Since March of last year.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Yes, since March of last year. I haven't got the exact dates for you. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and" />
    <node id="1. The role of schools and regional consortia in providing PDG support for looked-after children: Schools are responsible for using PDG funds to support looked-after children, while regional consortia play a role in improving the use of these funds through collaboration. However, there is less awareness about PDG's availability for looked-after children due to fewer numbers and historical focus on free school meals. It is crucial to improve communication and understanding of PDG's role in supporting this vulnerable group.&#10;2. The new schools categorization system in Wales: The new system targets resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector. By incorporating well-being into the national mission, the system addresses various challenges faced by children within the school setting. The categorization system identifies schools based on their needs and provides intensive support to help them make improvements.&#10;3. Improving PDG usage effectiveness: To improve the effectiveness of PDG usage, there needs to be a focus on leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Additionally, measures should be in place to demonstrate that PDG is being used properly and that good practice is being shared across regions. The new PDG regional advisers are expected to play a crucial role in this regard.&#10;&#10;Regarding the question about adjusting the eligibility criteria for the PDG, Kirsty Williams AM has mentioned ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need. While she acknowledges the concern about the blurring of eligibility and wider distribution of PDG funds, she also emphasizes the importance of flexible and responsive funding to address the needs of pupils in Wales. However, no explicit answer has been given concerning adjusting the eligibility criteria for the PDG in this transcript." />
    <node id=" pre-meeting is for.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Michelle, I defer to you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Michelle.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of, 'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. So, we will look at that. I think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive" />
    <node id=", but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done—because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say, 'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.' Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying, 'We're not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,' because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say" />
    <node id="1. The Schools Challenge Cymru program was explicitly designed to run for a time-limited period, as acknowledged by Kirsty Williams AM during the meeting transcript. However, the transcript does not provide specific information about the exact duration for which the program was planned to run.&#10;2. The transcript also indicates that there is no consensus about the optimal duration for school challenge programs across the UK, with programs in Manchester and Wales having different durations (three years and five years, respectively)." />
    <node id=", that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of—well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. The schools were aware of that. There were no surprises that it was supposed to be a time-limited programme. Evidence from across the UK showed that school challenge programmes have differed in time. So, for instance, Manchester's challenge was a three-year programme. So, there's no consensus about how many years you need to run a programme for. The previous Minister was quite clear about the time-limited nature of the programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school" />
    <node id=" was quite clear that it was a time-limited programme. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. Certainly the schools that I talk to—. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about—Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon—I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take—" />
    <node id="1. Unusual circumstances in 2016: While Kirsty Williams acknowledges that the attainment gap increased in 2017, she attributes it to specific circumstances in 2017. Although she doesn't explicitly mention the reasons for the increase in 2016, it is possible that there were unusual factors or challenges during that year that affected the performance of children on free school meals.&#10;2. Differences among schools: Kirsty Williams emphasizes that individual schools can have a significant impact on student performance. She highlights examples of schools with similar proportions of students on free school meals showing vastly different results, implying that specific practices or circumstances within these schools might contribute to the differences in student outcomes.&#10;3. Need for deeper analysis: Kirsty Williams mentions planning a formal &quot;deep-dive discussion&quot; about the factors influencing student performance in her department. This suggests that there is an understanding of the need to investigate and understand various elements affecting student achievement better, including socioeconomic backgrounds and school-specific factors.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Kirsty Williams does not provide a specific reason for the increase in children on free school meals who did not reach Level 2+ in 2016, she alludes to unusual circumstances, differences among schools, and the importance of deeper analysis to understand contributing factors better." />
    <node id="'re going to move on now to talk about the impact of PDG on attainment. Hefin David has got some questions.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. Is that correct?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. So, if you look at it—with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer—on the face of it, the gap has increased. I think what's important to recognise, Hefin, is a direction of travel. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. I think what's quite stark, if we think about it—. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus—one in five—by 2016, we had got that down to one" />
    <node id=" education authority and the same regional consortium—you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents. So, I think what's important is that we can't draw broad-brush conclusions. For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But we still need to rely on the trends from a distance. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years' time, when we will be looking back in two years' time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from" />
    <node id="Content: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again, Hefin, what we've got to be clear on is—while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic—we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, take Cardiff and Swansea, our two biggest cities. You've got schools in those cities with comparative levels of free school meals. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city—so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium—you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcript, there has been progress since 2015-16 in regional consortia focusing on specific groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes, especially for vulnerable pupils. Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that Estyn, during monitoring visits in autumn 2017, found three out of four regional consortia making strong progress in their work. However, the Welsh Government is still working with one regional consortium to address the findings of the Estyn report. This suggests that while progress has been made, there is still room for improvement in focusing on and supporting vulnerable pupils." />
    <node id=" on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes—for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: And that would include these particular issues.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members—you know, evidence" />
    <node id=", I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting—[Inaudible.]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them—and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this—it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions—I can't remember which ones—so he's established relationships—[Interruption.] Sorry?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Central south.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. As always, with many of these things, it's about individuals and relationships.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes—for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to" />
    <node id="1. Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales, reported in 2015-2016 that regional consortia were not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils, including vulnerable students, and tracking their outcomes.&#10;2. In response to this report, Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, stated that monitoring visits by Estyn in autumn 2017 found that three out of four regional consortia were making strong progress in their work, but that the Welsh Government was still working with one regional consortium to address the findings of the Estyn report.&#10;3. The newly appointed headteachers have been identified as contributing significantly to the speed at which schools engage with improvement efforts, as seen in a significant minority of schools with recent appointments. This is one of the lessons learned from the three-year investment in school leadership.&#10;4. The Government is focusing on systems and processes, teacher quality, and collaborative activity in their wider school improvement program, the national mission, to address this issue.&#10;5. Expertise from the Schools Challenge Cymru program has been integrated into regional consortia to benefit all schools, not just a small proportion.&#10;6. The Government recognizes that there is always room for improvement and is strengthening the role of regional PDG (Pupil Deprivation Grant) advisers to ensure individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for and doing, with a regional approach to good practice." />
    <node id="1. The number of staff that transitioned from Schools Challenge Cymru into the regional consortia was not provided in the transcript. However, Kirsty Williams mentioned that she met with some of them and that many of the best personnel from Schools Challenge Cymru now work for the regional school improvement services.&#10;2. Kirsty Williams also acknowledged a question from Llyr Gruffydd about her commitment to applying lessons learned from Schools Challenge Cymru to the wider school improvement agenda, given that she didn't meet with a particular individual from the program until six or seven months after coming into post." />
    <node id=" over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. I've got Darren first, then Mark.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And can I just say, I met with some of them?" />
    <node id="1. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers play a significant role in ensuring schools effectively use and demonstrate the impact of their PDG resources for school improvement work by scrutinizing how schools utilize these funds and asking probing questions about their strategies, impact, and outcomes. This helps maintain a focus on ensuring that PDG resources are used to their full potential and contribute to improved educational opportunities and outcomes for disadvantaged learners.&#10;2. By challenging and supporting schools in using PDG funds, regional consortia can help raise awareness of the availability and importance of these resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This approach promotes more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and helps narrow the attainment gap.&#10;3. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers are crucial in fostering a regional approach to good practice, as they can facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among schools to identify successful strategies for utilizing PDG funds effectively. This helps create a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that best practices are disseminated and adopted more widely.&#10;4. To maximize the impact of regional consortia's challenge and support advisers in this area, it is essential to provide them with adequate training, resources, and guidance on PDG policies and best practices. Strengthening their role and capacities will enable them to contribute more effectively to school improvement efforts and help ensure that PDG funds are used in ways that lead to better outcomes for disadvantaged learners." />
    <node id=" about, the expertise—how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply the lessons to all schools.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: The next questions, and the final questions, are from John. So, we're going to need succinct questions and succinct answers.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, it's an absolute—. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. It's crucial.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done" />
    <node id="1. Acknowledgement of Research Findings: Kirsty Williams AM acknowledges the research findings that challenge advisers are not effectively challenging schools to change their use of PDG, which is why she has taken steps to address this issue.&#10;2. Appointment of New Regional PDG Advisers: To improve the effectiveness of PDG usage, new regional PDG advisers have been appointed with the aim of spreading good practice across regions and ensuring strategic and consistent use of PDG in all schools. These advisers will provide overall advice on effective deployment of PDG funds.&#10;3. Strengthening the Role of Regional Challenge Advisers: By working closely with individual schools, regional challenge advisers will be challenged to examine their use of PDG, including how it is targeted and spent, and whether there is an evidence base for its use and a clear impact on student learning.&#10;4. Promoting Good Practice Regionally: Regional advisers will ensure that school challenge advisers are aware of best practices in using PDG, especially in targeting and spending decisions, encouraging schools to adopt these strategies to maximize the effectiveness of PDG funds.&#10;5. Encouraging Early Intervention: Regional advisers will emphasize the importance of early intervention strategies, using PDG funds earlier in a child's career rather than just before exams, to provide support and address learning needs proactively.&#10;6. Monitoring and Demonstrating Proper Use of PDG: Regional advisers will ensure that measures are in place to demonstrate that PDG is being used appropriately and consistently across schools, assessing the impact of PDG spending on student outcomes and making adjustments as needed." />
    <node id="1. The exact number of staff members that transitioned from Schools Challenge Cymru into the regional consortia was not provided in the transcript. However, Kirsty Williams mentioned that she met with some of them and many of the best personnel from Schools Challenge Cymru now work for the regional school improvement services.&#10;2. Kirsty Williams acknowledged Llyr Gruffydd's question about her commitment to applying lessons learned from Schools Challenge Cymru to the wider school improvement agenda, given that she didn't meet with a particular individual from the program until six or seven months after coming into post." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government recommends that schools use their PDG funding strategically and focus on leadership development, early intervention, and strategic use of the funds. They have appointed new regional advisers to ensure good practice is shared across regions, including proper identification of pupils in need, effective targeting and spending decisions, and promoting evidence-based interventions. These measures aim to improve student performance, particularly in the early years, primary, and key stage 3.&#10;&#10;2. While there is no explicit answer regarding adjusting eligibility criteria for PDG in this transcript, Kirsty Williams acknowledges ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need while recognizing that free school meals are an imperfect but useful proxy for identifying children requiring additional support. The conversation also highlights the importance of regional advisers ensuring schools use PDG funds appropriately and consistently, focusing on early intervention strategies.&#10;&#10;3. The new schools categorization system focuses resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, by incorporating well-being into the national mission. Improvement boards identify and support schools based on their level of need, with &quot;red&quot; schools entitled to 25 days of support. This approach allows for a more focused and efficient use of resources compared to the previous Schools Challenge Cymru program.&#10;&#10;4. The Welsh Government encourages schools to allocate PDG funding in a way that addresses fluctuating allocations and improves student performance, particularly in early years, primary, and key stage 3. This can be achieved by emphasizing leadership development, strategic use of PDG funds, and early intervention strategies, ensuring that regional advisers monitor the proper use of PDG and share good practices across regions.&#10;&#10;5. Kirsty Williams AM states that PDG funds should be used according to specific guidelines for individuals or universal application within schools. She acknowledges the importance of checks and balances in the system and strives to improve best practice implementation in more schools, ensuring that PDG funding is not being used to cover other funding gaps.&#10;&#10;6. Mark Reckless AM asks about the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement from children who have free school meals. Although Kirsty Williams does not provide specific data or direct evidence regarding this impact, she emphasizes the strategic use of PDG funds to promote best practices in schools, which can potentially lead to improvements in attendance and engagement for disadvantaged students." />
    <node id=" in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Mark's questions are next.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals?&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="1. Strengthening ALN provisions: To ensure that the new ALN legislation and regime effectively address the needs of the majority of looked-after learners with ALN, it's essential to prioritize improving ALN systems and support. This includes developing a clear understanding of these children's complex needs within the school setting and recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that can lead to exclusion or non-attendance.&#10;2. Improved communication and awareness: It is crucial to increase communication and understanding about PDG's availability for looked-after children, as the lower number of these children and regionalization of PDG support may contribute to less awareness. This will help schools and consortia use PDG funds more effectively to narrow the attainment gap for this vulnerable group.&#10;3. Effective use of PDG: By implementing measures such as leadership development, strategic use of PDG, early intervention, and demonstrating proper use of PDG, schools can maximize the effectiveness of PDG usage in supporting looked-after children with ALN.&#10;4. Regional advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers should play a crucial role in sharing good practices across regions, ensuring strategic and consistent use of PDG in all schools, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG, and promoting early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;5. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation: Kirsty Williams AM has mentioned ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need. Flexible and responsive funding is important for addressing the needs of pupils in Wales, including looked-after learners with ALN. Regular evaluations of data and adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria may be necessary to ensure these children receive the support they need." />
    <node id="G element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just" />
    <node id=" to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and still hold on to the fact that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: And then just one more question about the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children. They are, I understand, over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can" />
    <node id="1. Employing staff to work directly with families of older children: Schools like Ysgol y Preseli have employed staff specifically to engage with the families of older children, reinforcing the link between attendance and attainment. These staff members work individually with families to understand the barriers to attendance and find ways for the school to address those situations more effectively.&#10;&#10;2. Tailored interventions for older children: Recognizing that different approaches may be needed for older students, interventions should be tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. The example of a walking bus being less suitable for 15 or 16-year-olds illustrates this point.&#10;&#10;3. Early intervention strategies: By addressing the root causes of poor attendance early on, schools can prevent the problem from escalating. This can involve working with families to understand and overcome any barriers to regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening regional PDG advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers can play a crucial role in promoting best practices for improving school attendance, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG funds, and encouraging early intervention strategies. By ensuring that PDG is used strategically and consistently across all schools, these advisers can help narrow the attainment gap for vulnerable groups, including looked-after learners with ALN (Additional Learning Needs).&#10;&#10;5. Flexible and responsive funding: Regular evaluations of data and adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria may be necessary to ensure that older children, particularly those at key stage 4, receive the support they need to improve their attendance and attainment. This includes looking into potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need and providing flexible and responsive funding to address their complex needs.&#10;&#10;In summary, effective approaches for improving school attendance among older children include tailored interventions, early intervention strategies, and working closely with families to understand and address barriers to attendance. Strengthening the role of regional PDG advisers and ensuring flexible and responsive funding can also contribute significantly to addressing this issue." />
    <node id=" to bring in that type of initiative.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. So, you do need a different approach to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. I don't know if there's anything extra you wanted to add, Steve.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: There is also another very good example—and I take what you say about where there" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, Cabinet Secretary Kirsty Williams does not seem to be opposed to having further conversations about the lessons learned from the Schools Challenge Cymru program if there is advice indicating that they have not sufficiently learned those lessons. However, she expresses confidence that they have already learned the lessons and are applying them to the wider school improvement agenda. She mentions that there has been ongoing dialogue with a variety of people involved in the program and that they are actively considering developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base, and research. Therefore, while she is open to further conversations, her stance suggests that she believes that they have already effectively learned and applied the lessons from the Schools Challenge Cymru program." />
    <node id=" and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That's not something we're actively looking at. I am actively looking at developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base and research. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, we've reached the end of our session. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Okay. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children and Social Care on Families First funding. Paper to note" />
    <node id="1. The transcript does not provide specific information on why the money from the Schools Challenge Cymru program was returned to reserves instead of staying in the education budget. Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that it was a time-limited program and they secured investment from the Finance Minister to run it. However, the decision to return the funds to reserves is not explained in the transcript.&#10;2. It is also important to note that the Schools Challenge Cymru program was explicitly designed to run for a specific period, although the exact duration is not provided in the transcript. The transcript does mention that there are ongoing discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget.&#10;3. In summary, while the transcript provides context about the time-limited nature of the Schools Challenge Cymru program and the government's commitment to school improvement, it does not explicitly address the question of why the funds were returned to reserves instead of being kept in the education budget." />
    <node id=" programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over £10 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. The Minister for Finance was quite clear that it was a time-limited programme. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it" />
    <node id="1. The evolution of using the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG) in Welsh schools has not been significantly driven by cuts to core funding but rather by an increased focus on the agenda, improved understanding, and a better utilization of growing research and evidence.&#10;2. PDG funds have played a crucial role in concentrating the minds of school leadership and senior management teams, highlighting the importance of this agenda within schools and raising it in their thinking.&#10;3. As schools embark on a journey from a low base where this was not a priority for them, they are increasingly learning to use evidence and research from both Wales and outside sources to tailor approaches in their schools. This reflects the changing use of PDG funds.&#10;4. Regional consortia collaborate with schools to improve the use of PDG funds for looked-after children, although there is less awareness about PDG's availability due to fewer numbers and a historical focus on free school meals. Increased communication and understanding of PDG's role in supporting this vulnerable group are essential.&#10;5. The new schools categorization system targets resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, incorporating well-being into the national mission and addressing various challenges faced by children within the school setting.&#10;6. Effective use of PDG funds includes leadership development, strategic usage, early intervention, and proper monitoring to ensure good practice is shared across regions and that PDG funds are not used to cover other funding gaps." />
    <node id=" You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. I think there has been—. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been—well, I suppose it is the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffy" />
    <node id="1. Regarding the recruitment process and diversity in the Schools Challenge Cymru program, Professor Ainscow highlighted the success of the program in recruiting high-quality individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. He feels there is more to learn about how to support real excellence and diversity in recruitment for positions within the regional consortia. This insight suggests that he could provide valuable suggestions on improving recruitment and diversity based on his deep understanding of the Schools Challenge Cymru program and its successes.&#10;2. Cabinet Secretary Kirsty Williams is open to further conversations about lessons learned from the Schools Challenge Cymru program, but she also expresses confidence that they have already applied those lessons to the wider school improvement agenda. However, she acknowledges the value of ongoing dialogue with people involved in the program and considers developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base, and research. Therefore, there is a possibility for Professor Ainscow to provide further input to the Welsh Government on this matter, especially if he has additional insights that can help improve recruitment and diversity within the regional consortia." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the lack of grade stability and resilience among children on free school meals is a complex issue that cannot be attributed solely to exam boards or the Welsh Qualifications Authority (WQA). Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, acknowledges that it could be one of the contributory factors but also mentions ongoing discussions with Qualifications Wales to better understand this. She has asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of her policy board meeting in May for a deeper investigation into this matter. It is clear that while exam boards and WQA are being considered as part of the problem, a broader examination of contributing factors and best practices is taking place." />
    <node id=" Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy in all its forms that I think could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. We continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, to what extent would exam boards be responsible for lack of grade stability?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for" />
    <node id="1. The growth mindset approach, implemented through the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), has been shown to have a positive impact on the academic performance of free-school-meal children at the primary school level. This approach encourages learners to believe that they can improve their abilities and overcome failures, making them more resilient.&#10;2. Although this growth mindset training is provided universally to all students in a school, it has been observed to have a disproportionately positive effect on free-school-meal children. As a result, these children are now performing at the same level as their non-free-school-meal counterparts.&#10;3. This distinction is important because while individual interventions should be targeted specifically at children eligible for free school meals, whole-school approaches can also be effective in improving educational outcomes for this vulnerable group. By training all teachers and fostering a growth mindset ethos throughout the school, free-school-meal children benefit significantly.&#10;4. The key to successfully implementing the growth mindset approach through PDG funds is ensuring that schools use these resources effectively and demonstrate their impact on academic performance. Regional consortia play a crucial role in challenging and supporting schools in this process, promoting best practices and facilitating collaboration among educators." />
    <node id=" their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. So, there is no differentiation in those results. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that, 'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.' Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school—it's an ethos for the whole school—but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. So, that's the important distinction. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that," />
    <node id="1. The new schools categorization system in Wales provides a more targeted and intensive level of support for identified schools by using improvement boards to identify schools based on their level of need, with &quot;red&quot; schools entitled to 25 days of support. This is an increase from the 20 days of support provided under the Schools Challenge Cymru program. The new system targets resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, which was not the case with the previous program that only supported secondary schools.&#10;2. This new system also addresses various challenges faced by children within the school setting, ensuring they receive the necessary support to remain in school. By incorporating well-being into the national mission, it ensures that schools identified as needing improvement will receive the required intensive support to help them make improvements. Examples of Schools Challenge Cymru schools have sustained progress even after the program has ended, indicating the potential for success with this new system.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is taking steps to improve the PDG (Pupil Development Grant) agenda at a regional level by appointing new regional PDG advisers. This will ensure individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for and doing, promoting good practice regionally. This further strengthens the support provided to schools in need of improvement under the new system." />
    <node id="1. The recency of headteacher appointments and the effectiveness of support advisers played significant roles in the varying performance of schools in a program, as acknowledged by various speakers in the meeting transcript. Newly appointed headteachers were identified as contributing significantly to the speed at which schools engage with improvement efforts, as seen in a significant minority of schools with recent appointments. Additionally, the effectiveness of support advisers and challenge advisers varied, with some being &quot;really, really excellent and really good&quot; and driving change within individual schools, while others were less effective. The needs and challenges of individual schools also played a role in their performance, as some schools had more complex and deep-seated issues that required more intensive intervention." />
    <node id="1. Improved inter-agency collaboration: Strengthening the partnership between education, social services, and health is crucial for improving the educational attainment of looked-after children. This can be achieved by establishing a joined-up approach where all parties work together to address the complex needs of these children. Regular meetings and communication channels should be set up to discuss each child's progress and plan their support accordingly.&#10;&#10;2. Early intervention strategies: Local authorities can play a significant role in implementing early intervention strategies to identify and support looked-after children with additional learning needs (ALN) as soon as possible. This includes recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that may lead to exclusion or non-attendance. By addressing these challenges proactively, local authorities can help prevent further deterioration in educational outcomes for these vulnerable children.&#10;&#10;3. Strategic use of PDG: Local authorities should ensure that schools effectively use PDG funds to support looked-after children with ALN by promoting leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Regional advisers can share good practices across regions, challenge individual schools on their use of PDG, and promote early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;&#10;4. Focus on social services and health: Beyond the PDG, local authorities should ensure that social services consider educational placement as part of their decision-making process when determining where a looked-after child will go to school. Similarly, health services must collaborate with education providers to address any underlying health issues that may impact a child's ability to learn.&#10;&#10;5. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation: Local authorities should regularly evaluate data on the educational outcomes of looked-after children and make adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria as needed. This flexible and responsive approach will help ensure that these children receive the support they need, regardless of their categorization within the school system.&#10;&#10;6. Increased awareness: Local authorities should work towards raising awareness about the availability and importance of PDG resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This will help promote more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and contribute to narrowing the attainment gap." />
    <node id=". We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. It's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well. There's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. They were there at the group last week. David tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone. And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement, where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school—when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think, 'Oh my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?' If you can" />
    <node id="1. Tailored interventions for older children: Schools should create specific intervention strategies that cater to the unique needs and circumstances of older students, as one-size-fits-all approaches may not be as effective for this age group. For instance, a walking bus might not be suitable for 15 or 16-year-olds.&#10;&#10;2. Early intervention strategies: Addressing the root causes of poor attendance early on can prevent the problem from escalating. Schools can work with families to understand and overcome any barriers to regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;3. Working closely with families: Employing staff members to engage with the families of older children can help reinforce the link between attendance and attainment. These individuals can work individually with families to address barriers to attendance, gain a better understanding of the situation, and find ways for the school to tackle these issues more effectively.&#10;&#10;4. Flexible and responsive funding: Regular evaluations of data and adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria may be necessary to ensure that older children receive the support they need to improve their attendance and attainment. This includes looking into potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need and providing flexible and responsive funding to address their complex needs.&#10;&#10;Schools can work with families to address barriers to attendance by:&#10;1. Open communication: Maintaining open lines of communication with families, discussing any concerns, and involving them in the decision-making process regarding their child's education.&#10;2. Tailored support: Developing individualized support plans that consider the specific needs and circumstances of each family, such as flexible school schedules or remote learning options.&#10;3. Collaboration: Collaborating with other agencies, such as social services and health professionals, to address any underlying issues that may impact a child's ability to attend school regularly.&#10;4. Raising awareness: Increasing awareness about the importance of regular school attendance and the resources available through PDG to support looked-after children who may be at risk of poor attendance.&#10;5. Consistent monitoring and evaluation: Regularly evaluating attendance data, identifying trends, and adjusting strategies as needed to ensure that interventions are effective in improving attendance." />

So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr, in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools.

Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers play a significant role in ensuring schools effectively use and demonstrate the impact of their PDG resources for school improvement work by scrutinizing how schools utilize these funds and asking probing questions about their strategies, impact, and outcomes. This helps maintain a focus on ensuring that PDG resources are used to their full potential and contribute to improved educational opportunities and outcomes for disadvantaged learners.&#10;2. By challenging and supporting schools in using PDG funds, regional consortia can help raise awareness of the availability and importance of these resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This approach promotes more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and helps narrow the attainment gap.&#10;3. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers are crucial in fostering a regional approach to good practice, as they can facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among schools to identify successful strategies for utilizing PDG funds effectively. This helps create a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that best practices are disseminated and adopted more widely.&#10;4. To maximize the impact of regional consortia's challenge and support advisers in this area, it is essential to provide them with adequate training, resources, and guidance on PDG policies and best practices.

Role of schools and regional consortia in providing PDG support for looked-after children: Schools are responsible for using PDG funds to provide support for looked-after children, while regional consortia play a role in improving the use of these funds through regionalization and collaboration. In 2015, it was decided that PDG for looked-after children would be regionalized, meaning regional consortia would have a more significant role in providing support to schools.&#10;2. Less awareness about PDG's availability for looked-after children: There is less awareness about PDG's availability for looked-after children because there are fewer looked-after children compared to those eligible for free school meals. Additionally, the focus has historically been on free school meals due to their higher numbers.&#10;&#10;The lower number of looked-after children and the regionalization of PDG support contribute to less awareness about its availability for this group.

The role of schools and regional consortia in providing PDG support for looked-after children: Schools are responsible for using PDG funds to support looked-after children, while regional consortia play a role in improving the use of these funds through collaboration. However, there is less awareness about PDG's availability for looked-after children due to fewer numbers and historical focus on free school meals. It is crucial to improve communication and understanding of PDG's role in supporting this vulnerable group.&#10;2. The new schools categorization system in Wales: The new system targets resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector. By incorporating well-being into the national mission, the system addresses various challenges faced by children within the school setting. The categorization system identifies schools based on their needs and provides intensive support to help them make improvements.&#10;3. Improving PDG usage effectiveness: To improve the effectiveness of PDG usage, there needs to be a focus on leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Additionally, measures should be in place to demonstrate that PDG is being used properly and that good practice is being shared across regions. The new PDG regional advisers are expected to play a crucial role in this regard.&#10;&#10;Regarding the question about adjusting the eligibility criteria for the PDG, Kirsty Williams AM has mentioned ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need. While she acknowledges the concern about the blurring of eligibility and wider distribution of PDG funds, she also emphasizes the importance of flexible and responsive funding to address the needs of pupils in Wales. However, no explicit answer has been given concerning adjusting the eligibility criteria for the PDG in this transcript.">

Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers play a significant role in ensuring schools effectively use and demonstrate the impact of their PDG resources for school improvement work by scrutinizing how schools utilize these funds and asking probing questions about their strategies, impact, and outcomes. This helps maintain a focus on ensuring that PDG resources are used to their full potential and contribute to improved educational opportunities and outcomes for disadvantaged learners.&#10;2. By challenging and supporting schools in using PDG funds, regional consortia can help raise awareness of the availability and importance of these resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This approach promotes more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and helps narrow the attainment gap.&#10;3. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers are crucial in fostering a regional approach to good practice, as they can facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among schools to identify successful strategies for utilizing PDG funds effectively. This helps create a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that best practices are disseminated and adopted more widely.&#10;4. To maximize the impact of regional consortia's challenge and support advisers in this area, it is essential to provide them with adequate training, resources, and guidance on PDG policies and best practices. Strengthening their role and capacities will enable them to contribute more effectively to school improvement efforts and help ensure that PDG funds are used in ways that lead to better outcomes for disadvantaged learners.">

Strengthening ALN provisions: To ensure that the new ALN legislation and regime effectively address the needs of the majority of looked-after learners with ALN, it's essential to prioritize improving ALN systems and support. This includes developing a clear understanding of these children's complex needs within the school setting and recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that can lead to exclusion or non-attendance.&#10;2. Improved communication and awareness: It is crucial to increase communication and understanding about PDG's availability for looked-after children, as the lower number of these children and regionalization of PDG support may contribute to less awareness. This will help schools and consortia use PDG funds more effectively to narrow the attainment gap for this vulnerable group.&#10;3. Effective use of PDG: By implementing measures such as leadership development, strategic use of PDG, early intervention, and demonstrating proper use of PDG, schools can maximize the effectiveness of PDG usage in supporting looked-after children with ALN.&#10;4. Regional advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers should play a crucial role in sharing good practices across regions, ensuring strategic and consistent use of PDG in all schools, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG, and promoting early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;5. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation: Kirsty Williams AM has mentioned ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need. Flexible and responsive funding is important for addressing the needs of pupils in Wales, including looked-after learners with ALN.

Employing staff to work directly with families of older children: Schools like Ysgol y Preseli have employed staff specifically to engage with the families of older children, reinforcing the link between attendance and attainment. These staff members work individually with families to understand the barriers to attendance and find ways for the school to address those situations more effectively.&#10;&#10;2. Tailored interventions for older children: Recognizing that different approaches may be needed for older students, interventions should be tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. The example of a walking bus being less suitable for 15 or 16-year-olds illustrates this point.&#10;&#10;3. Early intervention strategies: By addressing the root causes of poor attendance early on, schools can prevent the problem from escalating. This can involve working with families to understand and overcome any barriers to regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening regional PDG advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers can play a crucial role in promoting best practices for improving school attendance, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG funds, and encouraging early intervention strategies. By ensuring that PDG is used strategically and consistently across all schools, these advisers can help narrow the attainment gap for vulnerable groups, including looked-after learners with ALN (Additional Learning Needs).&#10;&#10;5. Flexible and responsive funding: Regular evaluations of data and adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria may be necessary to ensure that older children, particularly those at key stage 4, receive the support they need to improve their attendance and attainment. This includes looking into potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need and providing flexible and responsive funding to address their complex needs.&#10;&#10;In summary, effective approaches for improving school attendance among older children include tailored interventions, early intervention strategies, and working closely with families to understand and address barriers to attendance. Strengthening the role of regional PDG advisers and ensuring flexible and responsive funding can also contribute significantly to addressing this issue.">

The growth mindset approach, implemented through the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), has been shown to have a positive impact on the academic performance of free-school-meal children at the primary school level. This approach encourages learners to believe that they can improve their abilities and overcome failures, making them more resilient.&#10;2. Although this growth mindset training is provided universally to all students in a school, it has been observed to have a disproportionately positive effect on free-school-meal children. As a result, these children are now performing at the same level as their non-free-school-meal counterparts.&#10;3. This distinction is important because while individual interventions should be targeted specifically at children eligible for free school meals, whole-school approaches can also be effective in improving educational outcomes for this vulnerable group. By training all teachers and fostering a growth mindset ethos throughout the school, free-school-meal children benefit significantly.&#10;4. The key to successfully implementing the growth mindset approach through PDG funds is ensuring that schools use these resources effectively and demonstrate their impact on academic performance. Regional consortia play a crucial role in challenging and supporting schools in this process, promoting best practices and facilitating collaboration among educators.">

Improved inter-agency collaboration: Strengthening the partnership between education, social services, and health is crucial for improving the educational attainment of looked-after children. This can be achieved by establishing a joined-up approach where all parties work together to address the complex needs of these children. Regular meetings and communication channels should be set up to discuss each child's progress and plan their support accordingly.&#10;&#10;2. Early intervention strategies: Local authorities can play a significant role in implementing early intervention strategies to identify and support looked-after children with additional learning needs (ALN) as soon as possible. This includes recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that may lead to exclusion or non-attendance. By addressing these challenges proactively, local authorities can help prevent further deterioration in educational outcomes for these vulnerable children.&#10;&#10;3. Strategic use of PDG: Local authorities should ensure that schools effectively use PDG funds to support looked-after children with ALN by promoting leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Regional advisers can share good practices across regions, challenge individual schools on their use of PDG, and promote early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;&#10;4. Focus on social services and health: Beyond the PDG, local authorities should ensure that social services consider educational placement as part of their decision-making process when determining where a looked-after child will go to school. Similarly, health services must collaborate with education providers to address any underlying health issues that may impact a child's ability to learn.&#10;&#10;5.

I think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around PDG is around free school meals. There is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. So, I think that's part of the explanation.

So, how would you respond to those findings?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths" target="1. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers play a significant role in ensuring schools effectively use and demonstrate the impact of their PDG resources for school improvement work by scrutinizing how schools utilize these funds and asking probing questions about their strategies, impact, and outcomes. This helps maintain a focus on ensuring that PDG resources are used to their full potential and contribute to improved educational opportunities and outcomes for disadvantaged learners.&#10;2. By challenging and supporting schools in using PDG funds, regional consortia can help raise awareness of the availability and importance of these resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This approach promotes more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and helps narrow the attainment gap.&#10;3. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers are crucial in fostering a regional approach to good practice, as they can facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among schools to identify successful strategies for utilizing PDG funds effectively. This helps create a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that best practices are disseminated and adopted more widely.&#10;4. To maximize the impact of regional consortia's challenge and support advisers in this area, it is essential to provide them with adequate training, resources, and guidance on PDG policies and best practices. Strengthening their role and capacities will enable them to contribute more effectively to school improvement efforts and help ensure that PDG funds are used in ways that lead to better outcomes for disadvantaged learners.">

She highlights examples of schools with similar proportions of students on free school meals showing vastly different results, implying that specific practices or circumstances within these schools might contribute to the differences in student outcomes.&#10;3. Need for deeper analysis: Kirsty Williams mentions planning a formal &quot;deep-dive discussion&quot; about the factors influencing student performance in her department. This suggests that there is an understanding of the need to investigate and understand various elements affecting student achievement better, including socioeconomic backgrounds and school-specific factors.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Kirsty Williams does not provide a specific reason for the increase in children on free school meals who did not reach Level 2+ in 2016, she alludes to unusual circumstances, differences among schools, and the importance of deeper analysis to understand contributing factors better.">

The growth mindset approach, implemented through the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), has been shown to have a positive impact on the academic performance of free-school-meal children at the primary school level. This approach encourages learners to believe that they can improve their abilities and overcome failures, making them more resilient.&#10;2. Although this growth mindset training is provided universally to all students in a school, it has been observed to have a disproportionately positive effect on free-school-meal children. As a result, these children are now performing at the same level as their non-free-school-meal counterparts.&#10;3. This distinction is important because while individual interventions should be targeted specifically at children eligible for free school meals, whole-school approaches can also be effective in improving educational outcomes for this vulnerable group. By training all teachers and fostering a growth mindset ethos throughout the school, free-school-meal children benefit significantly.&#10;4. The key to successfully implementing the growth mindset approach through PDG funds is ensuring that schools use these resources effectively and demonstrate their impact on academic performance. Regional consortia play a crucial role in challenging and supporting schools in this process, promoting best practices and facilitating collaboration among educators.">

So, that's the way I like to see it—that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. Of course, that's being developed in a different work stream. I think what's fair to say is that the use of PDG is evolving over time. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students.

Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child.

So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school? We're looking at the teacher quality—how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity—again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools. So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools—but that expertise is available to all our schools.&#10;Speaker: L">

Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers play a significant role in ensuring schools effectively use and demonstrate the impact of their PDG resources for school improvement work by scrutinizing how schools utilize these funds and asking probing questions about their strategies, impact, and outcomes. This helps maintain a focus on ensuring that PDG resources are used to their full potential and contribute to improved educational opportunities and outcomes for disadvantaged learners.&#10;2. By challenging and supporting schools in using PDG funds, regional consortia can help raise awareness of the availability and importance of these resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This approach promotes more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and helps narrow the attainment gap.&#10;3. Regional consortia's challenge and support advisers are crucial in fostering a regional approach to good practice, as they can facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing among schools to identify successful strategies for utilizing PDG funds effectively. This helps create a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that best practices are disseminated and adopted more widely.&#10;4. To maximize the impact of regional consortia's challenge and support advisers in this area, it is essential to provide them with adequate training, resources, and guidance on PDG policies and best practices.

The Welsh Government recommends that schools use their PDG funding strategically and focus on leadership development, early intervention, and strategic use of the funds. They have appointed new regional advisers to ensure good practice is shared across regions, including proper identification of pupils in need, effective targeting and spending decisions, and promoting evidence-based interventions. These measures aim to improve student performance, particularly in the early years, primary, and key stage 3.&#10;&#10;2. While there is no explicit answer regarding adjusting eligibility criteria for PDG in this transcript, Kirsty Williams acknowledges ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need while recognizing that free school meals are an imperfect but useful proxy for identifying children requiring additional support. The conversation also highlights the importance of regional advisers ensuring schools use PDG funds appropriately and consistently, focusing on early intervention strategies.&#10;&#10;3. The new schools categorization system focuses resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, by incorporating well-being into the national mission. Improvement boards identify and support schools based on their level of need, with &quot;red&quot; schools entitled to 25 days of support. This approach allows for a more focused and efficient use of resources compared to the previous Schools Challenge Cymru program.&#10;&#10;4. The Welsh Government encourages schools to allocate PDG funding in a way that addresses fluctuating allocations and improves student performance, particularly in early years, primary, and key stage 3. This can be achieved by emphasizing leadership development, strategic use of PDG funds, and early intervention strategies, ensuring that regional advisers monitor the proper use of PDG and share good practices across regions.&#10;&#10;5. Kirsty Williams AM states that PDG funds should be used according to specific guidelines for individuals or universal application within schools. She acknowledges the importance of checks and balances in the system and strives to improve best practice implementation in more schools, ensuring that PDG funding is not being used to cover other funding gaps.&#10;&#10;6. Mark Reckless AM asks about the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement from children who have free school meals. Although Kirsty Williams does not provide specific data or direct evidence regarding this impact, she emphasizes the strategic use of PDG funds to promote best practices in schools, which can potentially lead to improvements in attendance and engagement for disadvantaged students.">

Strengthening ALN provisions: To ensure that the new ALN legislation and regime effectively address the needs of the majority of looked-after learners with ALN, it's essential to prioritize improving ALN systems and support. This includes developing a clear understanding of these children's complex needs within the school setting and recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that can lead to exclusion or non-attendance.&#10;2. Improved communication and awareness: It is crucial to increase communication and understanding about PDG's availability for looked-after children, as the lower number of these children and regionalization of PDG support may contribute to less awareness. This will help schools and consortia use PDG funds more effectively to narrow the attainment gap for this vulnerable group.&#10;3. Effective use of PDG: By implementing measures such as leadership development, strategic use of PDG, early intervention, and demonstrating proper use of PDG, schools can maximize the effectiveness of PDG usage in supporting looked-after children with ALN.&#10;4. Regional advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers should play a crucial role in sharing good practices across regions, ensuring strategic and consistent use of PDG in all schools, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG, and promoting early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;5. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation: Kirsty Williams AM has mentioned ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need.

Employing staff to work directly with families of older children: Schools like Ysgol y Preseli have employed staff specifically to engage with the families of older children, reinforcing the link between attendance and attainment. These staff members work individually with families to understand the barriers to attendance and find ways for the school to address those situations more effectively.&#10;&#10;2. Tailored interventions for older children: Recognizing that different approaches may be needed for older students, interventions should be tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. The example of a walking bus being less suitable for 15 or 16-year-olds illustrates this point.&#10;&#10;3. Early intervention strategies: By addressing the root causes of poor attendance early on, schools can prevent the problem from escalating. This can involve working with families to understand and overcome any barriers to regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening regional PDG advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers can play a crucial role in promoting best practices for improving school attendance, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG funds, and encouraging early intervention strategies. By ensuring that PDG is used strategically and consistently across all schools, these advisers can help narrow the attainment gap for vulnerable groups, including looked-after learners with ALN (Additional Learning Needs).&#10;&#10;5. Flexible and responsive funding: Regular evaluations of data and adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria may be necessary to ensure that older children, particularly those at key stage 4, receive the support they need to improve their attendance and attainment. This includes looking into potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need and providing flexible and responsive funding to address their complex needs.&#10;&#10;In summary, effective approaches for improving school attendance among older children include tailored interventions, early intervention strategies, and working closely with families to understand and address barriers to attendance.

The evolution of using the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG) in Welsh schools has not been significantly driven by cuts to core funding but rather by an increased focus on the agenda, improved understanding, and a better utilization of growing research and evidence.&#10;2. PDG funds have played a crucial role in concentrating the minds of school leadership and senior management teams, highlighting the importance of this agenda within schools and raising it in their thinking.&#10;3. As schools embark on a journey from a low base where this was not a priority for them, they are increasingly learning to use evidence and research from both Wales and outside sources to tailor approaches in their schools. This reflects the changing use of PDG funds.&#10;4. Regional consortia collaborate with schools to improve the use of PDG funds for looked-after children, although there is less awareness about PDG's availability due to fewer numbers and a historical focus on free school meals.

This includes looking into potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need and providing flexible and responsive funding to address their complex needs.&#10;&#10;Schools can work with families to address barriers to attendance by:&#10;1. Open communication: Maintaining open lines of communication with families, discussing any concerns, and involving them in the decision-making process regarding their child's education.&#10;2. Tailored support: Developing individualized support plans that consider the specific needs and circumstances of each family, such as flexible school schedules or remote learning options.&#10;3. Collaboration: Collaborating with other agencies, such as social services and health professionals, to address any underlying issues that may impact a child's ability to attend school regularly.&#10;4. Raising awareness: Increasing awareness about the importance of regular school attendance and the resources available through PDG to support looked-after children who may be at risk of poor attendance.&#10;5. Consistent monitoring and evaluation: Regularly evaluating attendance data, identifying trends, and adjusting strategies as needed to ensure that interventions are effective in improving attendance.">

It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school? We're looking at the teacher quality—how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity—again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools.

The Welsh Government recommends that schools use their PDG funding strategically and focus on leadership development, early intervention, and strategic use of the funds. They have appointed new regional advisers to ensure good practice is shared across regions, including proper identification of pupils in need, effective targeting and spending decisions, and promoting evidence-based interventions. These measures aim to improve student performance, particularly in the early years, primary, and key stage 3.&#10;&#10;2. While there is no explicit answer regarding adjusting eligibility criteria for PDG in this transcript, Kirsty Williams acknowledges ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need while recognizing that free school meals are an imperfect but useful proxy for identifying children requiring additional support. The conversation also highlights the importance of regional advisers ensuring schools use PDG funds appropriately and consistently, focusing on early intervention strategies.&#10;&#10;3. The new schools categorization system focuses resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, by incorporating well-being into the national mission. Improvement boards identify and support schools based on their level of need, with &quot;red&quot; schools entitled to 25 days of support. This approach allows for a more focused and efficient use of resources compared to the previous Schools Challenge Cymru program.&#10;&#10;4. The Welsh Government encourages schools to allocate PDG funding in a way that addresses fluctuating allocations and improves student performance, particularly in early years, primary, and key stage 3. This can be achieved by emphasizing leadership development, strategic use of PDG funds, and early intervention strategies, ensuring that regional advisers monitor the proper use of PDG and share good practices across regions.&#10;&#10;5. Kirsty Williams AM states that PDG funds should be used according to specific guidelines for individuals or universal application within schools. She acknowledges the importance of checks and balances in the system and strives to improve best practice implementation in more schools, ensuring that PDG funding is not being used to cover other funding gaps.&#10;&#10;6. Mark Reckless AM asks about the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement from children who have free school meals. Although Kirsty Williams does not provide specific data or direct evidence regarding this impact, she emphasizes the strategic use of PDG funds to promote best practices in schools, which can potentially lead to improvements in attendance and engagement for disadvantaged students.">

The evolution of using the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG) in Welsh schools has not been significantly driven by cuts to core funding but rather by an increased focus on the agenda, improved understanding, and a better utilization of growing research and evidence.&#10;2. PDG funds have played a crucial role in concentrating the minds of school leadership and senior management teams, highlighting the importance of this agenda within schools and raising it in their thinking.&#10;3. As schools embark on a journey from a low base where this was not a priority for them, they are increasingly learning to use evidence and research from both Wales and outside sources to tailor approaches in their schools. This reflects the changing use of PDG funds.&#10;4. Regional consortia collaborate with schools to improve the use of PDG funds for looked-after children, although there is less awareness about PDG's availability due to fewer numbers and a historical focus on free school meals.

The growth mindset approach, implemented through the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), has been shown to have a positive impact on the academic performance of free-school-meal children at the primary school level. This approach encourages learners to believe that they can improve their abilities and overcome failures, making them more resilient.&#10;2. Although this growth mindset training is provided universally to all students in a school, it has been observed to have a disproportionately positive effect on free-school-meal children. As a result, these children are now performing at the same level as their non-free-school-meal counterparts.&#10;3. This distinction is important because while individual interventions should be targeted specifically at children eligible for free school meals, whole-school approaches can also be effective in improving educational outcomes for this vulnerable group. By training all teachers and fostering a growth mindset ethos throughout the school, free-school-meal children benefit significantly.&#10;4. The key to successfully implementing the growth mindset approach through PDG funds is ensuring that schools use these resources effectively and demonstrate their impact on academic performance. Regional consortia play a crucial role in challenging and supporting schools in this process, promoting best practices and facilitating collaboration among educators.">

The new schools categorization system in Wales provides a more targeted and intensive level of support for identified schools by using improvement boards to identify schools based on their level of need, with &quot;red&quot; schools entitled to 25 days of support. This is an increase from the 20 days of support provided under the Schools Challenge Cymru program. The new system targets resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, which was not the case with the previous program that only supported secondary schools.&#10;2. This new system also addresses various challenges faced by children within the school setting, ensuring they receive the necessary support to remain in school. By incorporating well-being into the national mission, it ensures that schools identified as needing improvement will receive the required intensive support to help them make improvements. Examples of Schools Challenge Cymru schools have sustained progress even after the program has ended, indicating the potential for success with this new system.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is taking steps to improve the PDG (Pupil Development Grant) agenda at a regional level by appointing new regional PDG advisers. This will ensure individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for and doing, promoting good practice regionally.

Additionally, the effectiveness of support advisers and challenge advisers varied, with some being &quot;really, really excellent and really good&quot; and driving change within individual schools, while others were less effective.

Is that correct?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. So, if you look at it—with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer—on the face of it, the gap has increased. I think what's important to recognise, Hefin, is a direction of travel. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. I think what's quite stark, if we think about it—. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus—one in five—by 2016, we had got that down to one">

Employing staff to work directly with families of older children: Schools like Ysgol y Preseli have employed staff specifically to engage with the families of older children, reinforcing the link between attendance and attainment. These staff members work individually with families to understand the barriers to attendance and find ways for the school to address those situations more effectively.&#10;&#10;2. Tailored interventions for older children: Recognizing that different approaches may be needed for older students, interventions should be tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. The example of a walking bus being less suitable for 15 or 16-year-olds illustrates this point.&#10;&#10;3. Early intervention strategies: By addressing the root causes of poor attendance early on, schools can prevent the problem from escalating. This can involve working with families to understand and overcome any barriers to regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening regional PDG advisers' role: Newly appointed regional PDG advisers can play a crucial role in promoting best practices for improving school attendance, challenging individual schools on their use of PDG funds, and encouraging early intervention strategies.

The growth mindset approach, implemented through the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), has been shown to have a positive impact on the academic performance of free-school-meal children at the primary school level. This approach encourages learners to believe that they can improve their abilities and overcome failures, making them more resilient.&#10;2. Although this growth mindset training is provided universally to all students in a school, it has been observed to have a disproportionately positive effect on free-school-meal children. As a result, these children are now performing at the same level as their non-free-school-meal counterparts.&#10;3. This distinction is important because while individual interventions should be targeted specifically at children eligible for free school meals, whole-school approaches can also be effective in improving educational outcomes for this vulnerable group. By training all teachers and fostering a growth mindset ethos throughout the school, free-school-meal children benefit significantly.&#10;4. The key to successfully implementing the growth mindset approach through PDG funds is ensuring that schools use these resources effectively and demonstrate their impact on academic performance. Regional consortia play a crucial role in challenging and supporting schools in this process, promoting best practices and facilitating collaboration among educators.">

Improved inter-agency collaboration: Strengthening the partnership between education, social services, and health is crucial for improving the educational attainment of looked-after children. This can be achieved by establishing a joined-up approach where all parties work together to address the complex needs of these children. Regular meetings and communication channels should be set up to discuss each child's progress and plan their support accordingly.&#10;&#10;2. Early intervention strategies: Local authorities can play a significant role in implementing early intervention strategies to identify and support looked-after children with additional learning needs (ALN) as soon as possible. This includes recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that may lead to exclusion or non-attendance. By addressing these challenges proactively, local authorities can help prevent further deterioration in educational outcomes for these vulnerable children.&#10;&#10;3. Strategic use of PDG: Local authorities should ensure that schools effectively use PDG funds to support looked-after children with ALN by promoting leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Regional advisers can share good practices across regions, challenge individual schools on their use of PDG, and promote early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;&#10;4. Focus on social services and health: Beyond the PDG, local authorities should ensure that social services consider educational placement as part of their decision-making process when determining where a looked-after child will go to school. Similarly, health services must collaborate with education providers to address any underlying health issues that may impact a child's ability to learn.&#10;&#10;5. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation: Local authorities should regularly evaluate data on the educational outcomes of looked-after children and make adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria as needed. This flexible and responsive approach will help ensure that these children receive the support they need, regardless of their categorization within the school system.&#10;&#10;6. Increased awareness: Local authorities should work towards raising awareness about the availability and importance of PDG resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals.

Acknowledgement of Research Findings: Kirsty Williams AM acknowledges the research findings that challenge advisers are not effectively challenging schools to change their use of PDG, which is why she has taken steps to address this issue.&#10;2. Appointment of New Regional PDG Advisers: To improve the effectiveness of PDG usage, new regional PDG advisers have been appointed with the aim of spreading good practice across regions and ensuring strategic and consistent use of PDG in all schools. These advisers will provide overall advice on effective deployment of PDG funds.&#10;3. Strengthening the Role of Regional Challenge Advisers: By working closely with individual schools, regional challenge advisers will be challenged to examine their use of PDG, including how it is targeted and spent, and whether there is an evidence base for its use and a clear impact on student learning.&#10;4. Promoting Good Practice Regionally: Regional advisers will ensure that school challenge advisers are aware of best practices in using PDG, especially in targeting and spending decisions, encouraging schools to adopt these strategies to maximize the effectiveness of PDG funds.&#10;5. Encouraging Early Intervention: Regional advisers will emphasize the importance of early intervention strategies, using PDG funds earlier in a child's career rather than just before exams, to provide support and address learning needs proactively.&#10;6. Monitoring and Demonstrating Proper Use of PDG: Regional advisers will ensure that measures are in place to demonstrate that PDG is being used appropriately and consistently across schools, assessing the impact of PDG spending on student outcomes and making adjustments as needed." target="1. The Welsh Government recommends that schools use their PDG funding strategically and focus on leadership development, early intervention, and strategic use of the funds. They have appointed new regional advisers to ensure good practice is shared across regions, including proper identification of pupils in need, effective targeting and spending decisions, and promoting evidence-based interventions. These measures aim to improve student performance, particularly in the early years, primary, and key stage 3.&#10;&#10;2. While there is no explicit answer regarding adjusting eligibility criteria for PDG in this transcript, Kirsty Williams acknowledges ongoing discussions about potential alternative ways to identify pupils in need while recognizing that free school meals are an imperfect but useful proxy for identifying children requiring additional support. The conversation also highlights the importance of regional advisers ensuring schools use PDG funds appropriately and consistently, focusing on early intervention strategies.&#10;&#10;3. The new schools categorization system focuses resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, by incorporating well-being into the national mission.

PDG funds have played a crucial role in concentrating the minds of school leadership and senior management teams, highlighting the importance of this agenda within schools and raising it in their thinking.&#10;3. As schools embark on a journey from a low base where this was not a priority for them, they are increasingly learning to use evidence and research from both Wales and outside sources to tailor approaches in their schools. This reflects the changing use of PDG funds.&#10;4. Regional consortia collaborate with schools to improve the use of PDG funds for looked-after children, although there is less awareness about PDG's availability due to fewer numbers and a historical focus on free school meals. Increased communication and understanding of PDG's role in supporting this vulnerable group are essential.&#10;5. The new schools categorization system targets resources towards schools with greater needs, regardless of their type or sector, incorporating well-being into the national mission and addressing various challenges faced by children within the school setting.&#10;6. Effective use of PDG funds includes leadership development, strategic usage, early intervention, and proper monitoring to ensure good practice is shared across regions and that PDG funds are not used to cover other funding gaps." target="1. The growth mindset approach, implemented through the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), has been shown to have a positive impact on the academic performance of free-school-meal children at the primary school level. This approach encourages learners to believe that they can improve their abilities and overcome failures, making them more resilient.&#10;2. Although this growth mindset training is provided universally to all students in a school, it has been observed to have a disproportionately positive effect on free-school-meal children. As a result, these children are now performing at the same level as their non-free-school-meal counterparts.&#10;3. This distinction is important because while individual interventions should be targeted specifically at children eligible for free school meals, whole-school approaches can also be effective in improving educational outcomes for this vulnerable group. By training all teachers and fostering a growth mindset ethos throughout the school, free-school-meal children benefit significantly.&#10;4.

    <edge source="Based on the transcript, the lack of grade stability and resilience among children on free school meals is a complex issue that cannot be attributed solely to exam boards or the Welsh Qualifications Authority (WQA). Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, acknowledges that it could be one of the contributory factors but also mentions ongoing discussions with Qualifications Wales to better understand this. She has asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of her policy board meeting in May for a deeper investigation into this matter. It is clear that while exam boards and WQA are being considered as part of the problem, a broader examination of contributing factors and best practices is taking place." target=" Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy in all its forms that I think could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. We continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, to what extent would exam boards be responsible for lack of grade stability?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: It could be one of the contributory factors.

So, there is no differentiation in those results. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that, 'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.' Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school—it's an ethos for the whole school—but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. So, that's the important distinction. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that,">

The recency of headteacher appointments and the effectiveness of support advisers played significant roles in the varying performance of schools in a program, as acknowledged by various speakers in the meeting transcript. Newly appointed headteachers were identified as contributing significantly to the speed at which schools engage with improvement efforts, as seen in a significant minority of schools with recent appointments. Additionally, the effectiveness of support advisers and challenge advisers varied, with some being &quot;really, really excellent and really good&quot; and driving change within individual schools, while others were less effective.

    <edge source="1. Improved inter-agency collaboration: Strengthening the partnership between education, social services, and health is crucial for improving the educational attainment of looked-after children. This can be achieved by establishing a joined-up approach where all parties work together to address the complex needs of these children. Regular meetings and communication channels should be set up to discuss each child's progress and plan their support accordingly.&#10;&#10;2. Early intervention strategies: Local authorities can play a significant role in implementing early intervention strategies to identify and support looked-after children with additional learning needs (ALN) as soon as possible. This includes recognizing the connections between ALN and behavior issues that may lead to exclusion or non-attendance. By addressing these challenges proactively, local authorities can help prevent further deterioration in educational outcomes for these vulnerable children.&#10;&#10;3. Strategic use of PDG: Local authorities should ensure that schools effectively use PDG funds to support looked-after children with ALN by promoting leadership development, strategic use of PDG, and early intervention. Regional advisers can share good practices across regions, challenge individual schools on their use of PDG, and promote early intervention strategies to address learning needs proactively.&#10;&#10;4. Focus on social services and health: Beyond the PDG, local authorities should ensure that social services consider educational placement as part of their decision-making process when determining where a looked-after child will go to school. Similarly, health services must collaborate with education providers to address any underlying health issues that may impact a child's ability to learn.&#10;&#10;5. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation: Local authorities should regularly evaluate data on the educational outcomes of looked-after children and make adjustments to PDG eligibility criteria as needed. This flexible and responsive approach will help ensure that these children receive the support they need, regardless of their categorization within the school system.&#10;&#10;6. Increased awareness: Local authorities should work towards raising awareness about the availability and importance of PDG resources for looked-after children, who may not receive as much attention due to their smaller numbers compared to those eligible for free school meals. This will help promote more equitable distribution of resources and support across different vulnerable groups and contribute to narrowing the attainment gap." target=". We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. It's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well. There's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. They were there at the group last week. David tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone. And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement, where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school—when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think, 'Oh my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?' If you can">

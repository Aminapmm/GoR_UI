He wrote a pamphlet on Malt, took a strong interest in the Negro Emancipation question, and became friends with Mr. Wilberforce, whose politics he admired.

He was also known for paying his addresses to Lady Jane Sheepshanks.&#10;&#10;In addition to these, he served as a magistrate and an active religious speaker in the countryside, engaging with those who were destitute of religious instruction.

Then he became a&#10;friend of Mr. Wilberforce's, whose politics he admired, and had that&#10;famous correspondence with the Reverend Silas Hornblower, on the&#10;Ashantee Mission.  He was in London, if not for the Parliament session,&#10;at least in May, for the religious meetings.  In the country he was a&#10;magistrate, and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute of&#10;religious instruction.

Are we to suppose from this curiosity and&#10;prying into dictionaries, could our heroine suppose that Mr. Crawley&#10;was interested in her?--no, only in a friendly way.  Have we not stated&#10;that he was attached to Lady Jane Sheepshanks?&#10;&#10;He took Rebecca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at&#10;backgammon with Sir Pitt, saying that it was a godless amusement, and&#10;that she would be much better engaged in reading &quot;Thrump's Legacy,&quot; or&#10;&quot;The Blind Washerwoman of Moorfields,&quot; or any work of a more serious&#10;nature; but Miss Sharp said her dear mother used often to play the same&#10;game with the old Count de Trictrac and the venerable Abbe du Cornet,&#10;and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusements.&#10;&#10;But it was not only by playing" />

    <node id="1. The grand hall at Queen's Crawley is a large space with a sizable fireplace that could accommodate half of Miss Pinkerton's school and can roast an ox. It houses numerous portraits of generations of Crawleys, adorned with various fashions from beards and ruffs to wigs, towering hairstyles, and gowns.&#10;2. The grand staircase is made of black oak, contributing to the dismal atmosphere of the hall. There are tall doors on either side leading to various rooms such as the billiard-room, library, yellow saloon, and morning-rooms.&#10;3. It appears that there are at least twenty bedrooms on the first floor, one of which was occupied by Queen Elizabeth during her time. The estate is large enough for expansive fields, a wash house, and a south wall filled with peaches.&#10;4. The portraits in the hall highlight historical figures such as Charles Stuart, referred to as Barebones Crawley, who is depicted in full armor and a forked beard, symbolizing his significance in the family's lineage.&#10;5. The dining room is elegantly furnished with glistening old plate displayed on the sideboard, showcasing various antique cups, salvers, and cruet-stands from prestigious silvermakers like Rundell and Bridge. All tableware, including serving dishes, are made of silver.&#10;6. Two red-haired footmen in canary-colored livery stand on either side of the sideboard to serve during dinner, emphasizing the grandeur and stature of the estate." />

It has a large fireplace, in which we might put half Miss&#10;Pinkerton's school, and the grate is big enough to roast an ox at the&#10;very least.  Round the room hang I don't know how many generations of&#10;Crawleys, some with beards and ruffs, some with huge wigs and toes&#10;turned out, some dressed in long straight stays and gowns that look as&#10;stiff as towers, and some with long ringlets, and oh, my dear! scarcely&#10;any stays at all.  At one end of the hall is the great staircase all in&#10;black oak, as dismal as may be, and on either side are tall doors with&#10;stags' heads over them, leading to the billiard-room and the library,&#10;and the great yellow saloon and the morning-rooms.

So the children&#10;(little dears!) came with Miss Sharp; and of an evening some of the&#10;party would walk back together.  Not Miss Crawley--she preferred her&#10;carriage--but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little&#10;park wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the checkered&#10;avenue to Queen's Crawley, was charming in the moonlight to two such&#10;lovers of the picturesque as the Captain and Miss Rebecca.&#10;&#10;&quot;O those stars, those stars!&quot; Miss Rebecca would say, turning her&#10;twinkling green eyes up towards them.  &quot;I feel myself almost a spirit&#10;when I gaze upon them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O--ah--Gad--yes, so do I exactly, Miss Sharp,&quot; the other enthusiast" />

Out of his waistcoat, as usual, grows a tree,&#10;on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are&#10;inscribed.  Close by the name of Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet (the subject&#10;of the present memoir), are written that of his brother, the Reverend&#10;Bute Crawley (the great Commoner was in disgrace when the reverend&#10;gentleman was born), rector of Crawley-cum-Snailby, and of various&#10;other male and female members of the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt was first married to Grizzel, sixth daughter of Mungo Binkie,&#10;Lord Binkie, and cousin, in consequence, of Mr. Dundas.

He had just been&#10;to the cellar, and was in full dress too; that is, he had taken his&#10;gaiters off, and showed his little dumpy legs in black worsted&#10;stockings.  The sideboard was covered with glistening old plate--old&#10;cups, both gold and silver; old salvers and cruet-stands, like Rundell&#10;and Bridge's shop.  Everything on the table was in silver too, and two&#10;footmen, with red hair and canary-coloured liveries, stood on either&#10;side of the sideboard.&#10;&#10;Mr. Crawley said a long grace, and Sir Pitt said amen, and the great&#10;silver dish-covers were removed.&#10;&#10;&quot;What have we for dinner, Betsy?&quot; said the Baronet.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the description provided, the complexioned woman appears to be a hardworking but submissive individual who lacks confidence and assertiveness. She is blonde and fair-skinned, and she usually wears light-colored clothes, preferring sea-green or slatternly sky-blue. Her main work involves making counterpanes for all the beds in Crawley, and she also has a small flower-garden that she cares for.&#10;&#10;When her husband is rude to her, she responds with apathy, but when he strikes her, she cries. She doesn't have enough character to take to drinking, and she spends most of her day moaning about in slipshod and curl-papers. The narrative suggests that she may have been a cheerful lass if not for the allure of status and wealth in Vanity Fair.&#10;&#10;If it weren't for the social pressure to seek titles and material possessions, she might have been content with a simpler life as Peter Butt's wife, living on a snug farm with a hearty family and facing the usual struggles and joys that come with it. However, her lack of character and assertiveness makes her vulnerable to her husband's abuse, and she doesn't have the confidence or strength to stand up for herself.&#10;&#10;Overall, the complexioned woman's life is marked by hard work, submissiveness, and a lack of agency. Her situation might be different if she had more character and self-esteem, but her circumstances are largely shaped by the social norms and values that prioritize wealth and status over personal happiness and fulfillment." />
    <node id="complexioned woman,&#10;she wore light clothes, as most blondes will, and appeared, in&#10;preference, in draggled sea-green, or slatternly sky-blue.  She worked&#10;that worsted day and night, or other pieces like it.  She had&#10;counterpanes in the course of a few years to all the beds in Crawley.&#10;She had a small flower-garden, for which she had rather an affection;&#10;but beyond this no other like or disliking.  When her husband was rude&#10;to her she was apathetic: whenever he struck her she cried.  She had&#10;not character enough to take to drinking, and moaned about, slipshod&#10;and in curl-papers all day.  O Vanity Fair--Vanity Fair! This might&#10;have been, but for you, a cheery lass--Peter Butt and Rose a happy man&#10;and wife, in a snug farm, with a hearty family; and an honest portion&#10;of pleasures, cares, hopes and struggles--but a title and a coach and&#10;four are toys more precious than happiness in Vanity Fair: and if Harry&#10;the Eighth or Bluebeard were alive now, and wanted a tenth wife" />

He was only good enough to be a fairy prince; and oh, what&#10;magnanimity to stoop to such a humble Cinderella!  Miss Pinkerton would&#10;have tried to check this blind devotion very likely, had she been&#10;Amelia's confidante; but not with much success, depend upon it.  It is&#10;in the nature and instinct of some women.  Some are made to scheme, and&#10;some to love; and I wish any respected bachelor that reads this may&#10;take the sort that best likes him.&#10;&#10;While under this overpowering impression, Miss Amelia neglected her&#10;twelve dear friends at Chiswick most cruelly, as such selfish people&#10;commonly will do.

Of what else have&#10;young ladies to think, but husbands? Of what else do their dear mammas&#10;think?  &quot;I must be my own mamma,&quot; said Rebecca; not without a tingling&#10;consciousness of defeat, as she thought over her little misadventure&#10;with Jos Sedley.&#10;&#10;So she wisely determined to render her position with the Queen's&#10;Crawley family comfortable and secure, and to this end resolved to make&#10;friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her&#10;comfort.&#10;&#10;As my Lady Crawley was not one of these personages, and a woman,&#10;moreover, so indolent and void of character as not to be of the least&#10;consequence in her own house, Rebecca soon found that it was not at all&#10;necessary to" />

Her roses faded out of her cheeks, and the pretty&#10;freshness left her figure after the birth of a couple of children, and&#10;she became a mere machine in her husband's house of no more use than&#10;the late Lady Crawley's grand piano.

However, her husband's rudeness and physical abuse have significantly affected her demeanor. She responds to his rude behavior with apathy but cries whenever he strikes her. Her lack of confidence and assertiveness makes her vulnerable to her husband's abuse, and she doesn't have the strength to stand up for herself. Overall, her life is marked by hard work, submissiveness, and a lack of agency, largely shaped by social norms that prioritize wealth and status over personal happiness and fulfillment." />

The Baronet owed his son&#10;a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother, which he did not find&#10;it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to&#10;paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to discharge his&#10;debts.  Miss Sharp calculated (for she became, as we shall hear&#10;speedily, inducted into most of the secrets of the family) that the&#10;mere payment of his creditors cost the honourable Baronet several&#10;hundreds yearly; but this was a delight he could not forego; he had a&#10;savage pleasure in making the poor wretches wait, and in shifting from&#10;court to court and from term to term the period of satisfaction.&#10;What's the good of being in Parliament, he said, if you must pay your&#10;debts?

Encouraging good behavior and providing advice: Miss Sharp advises Mr. Crawley on the propriety of certain activities, such as playing backgammon, encouraging him to engage in more serious pursuits or at least justifying her own involvement in these worldly amusements.&#10;&#10;Based on these activities, Rebecca Sharp believes that nothing will affect her principles in the refined circle of Sir Pitt Crawley because she has been actively engaged in teaching and assisting the family, while also demonstrating her knowledge and understanding of estate matters and socializing with grace in illustrious company." />

The two brothers Crawley, who usually hate each other, become quite loving at Christmas during Miss Crawley's visit. There is no quarreling heard of, and the Hall visits the Rectory, and vice versa, with both parties talking about pigs and poachers without conflict.&#10;3. When Miss Crawley arrives, the sermon books are shut up, and Mr. Pitt, who is abominated by Miss Crawley, finds it convenient to go to town.&#10;4. The schoolroom sees changes too, as Rebecca (the governess) imparts instruction to Miss Rose through reading delightful French and English works, such as those of Dr. Smollett, Mr. Henry Fielding, Monsieur Crebillon the younger, and Monsieur de Voltaire.&#10;5. In response to an incident involving her pet sow running her down and destroying a flowered lilac silk dress, Miss Rose is treated much more kindly than she would have been a week ago. Sir Pitt only laughs off the accident instead of swearing frightfully, boxing her ears, and putting her on bread and water for a month.&#10;6. Overall, Miss Rose is welcomed warmly into the country estate, and there are noticeable improvements in the atmosphere and relationships within both the household and schoolroom during Miss Crawley's visit." />

However, her husband's rudeness and physical abuse have significantly affected her demeanor. She responds to his rude behavior with apathy but cries whenever he strikes her. Her lack of confidence and assertiveness makes her vulnerable to her husband's abuse, and she doesn't have the strength to stand up for herself. Overall, her life is marked by hard work, submissiveness, and a lack of agency, largely shaped by social norms that prioritize wealth and status over personal happiness and fulfillment. Her relationship with her husband is marked by his rudeness, physical abuse, and obsession with wealth and status, which contrasts sharply with her simple desires and gentle nature." />

    <node id="Sir Pitt is a baronet who demonstrates respect and propriety towards his second wife, Lady Crawley, both in word and action. He taught the butler to address her with respect and ensures that she is served and escorted in a polite manner. Although he seldom speaks to her, when he does, it is with great respect.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt was known as &quot;Miss Crawley&quot; at Eton, where his younger brother Rawdon used to bully him. Despite not being academically inclined, he made up for it with hard work and dedication, never receiving punishment during his eight years at school. His college career was also commendable, and he studied ancient and modern orators in preparation for a life in public office under the patronage of his grandfather, Lord Binkie.&#10;&#10;As for his behavior towards Lady Crawley, Sir Pitt is much more restrained compared to how he would have behaved before, indicating that he values and respects her more now. He no longer swears at her or mistreats her since Miss Crawley's arrival, which has also had a positive impact on the relationship between him and his brother, the rector." />

He seldom spoke to her,&#10;but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let&#10;her quit the apartment without rising in the most stately manner to&#10;open the door, and making an elegant bow at her egress.&#10;&#10;At Eton he was called Miss Crawley; and there, I am sorry to say, his&#10;younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently.  But though his&#10;parts were not brilliant, he made up for his lack of talent by&#10;meritorious industry, and was never known, during eight years at&#10;school, to be subject to that punishment which it is generally thought&#10;none but a cherub can escape.&#10;&#10;At college his career was of course highly creditable.

He was a man of such rigid refinement, that he would have&#10;starved rather than have dined without a white neckcloth.  Once, when&#10;just from college, and when Horrocks the butler brought him a letter&#10;without placing it previously on a tray, he gave that domestic a look,&#10;and administered to him a speech so cutting, that Horrocks ever after&#10;trembled before him; the whole household bowed to him: Lady Crawley's&#10;curl-papers came off earlier when he was at home: Sir Pitt's muddy&#10;gaiters disappeared; and if that incorrigible old man still adhered to&#10;other old habits, he never fuddled himself with rum-and-water in his&#10;son's presence, and only talked to his servants in a very reserved and&#10;polite manner; and those persons remarked that Sir Pitt never swore at&#10;Lady Crawley while his son was in the room.&#10;&#10;It was he who taught the" />

She read Voltaire,&#10;and had Rousseau by heart; talked very lightly about divorce, and most&#10;energetically of the rights of women.  She had pictures of Mr. Fox in&#10;every room in the house: when that statesman was in opposition, I am&#10;not sure that she had not flung a main with him; and when he came into&#10;office, she took great credit for bringing over to him Sir Pitt and his&#10;colleague for Queen's Crawley, although Sir Pitt would have come over&#10;himself, without any trouble on the honest lady's part.  It is needless&#10;to say that Sir Pitt was brought to change his views after the death of&#10;the great Whig statesman.&#10;&#10;This worthy old lady took a fancy to Rawdon Crawley when a boy, sent&#10;him to Cambridge (in opposition to his brother at Oxford), and, when&#10;the young" />
    <node id="Based on the provided text, the old gentleman, Sir Pitt Crawley, does not seem to be very generous in terms of giving money away. In fact, he states that it is against his principle to give away money (referred to as &quot;farthing&quot; which is a British coin worth a quarter of an old penny). Instead, he prefers to dine frugally and smoke his pipe. His dining habits are described as simple, sharing tripe and onions with Mrs. Tinker, and when the baronet is not at home, Tinker, his butler, is on &quot;board wages,&quot; while Mrs. Tinker dines with the family.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, he displays a lack of politeness towards Rebecca Sharp, addressing her in a condescending manner, making it clear that any favor shown to her is due to her proximity to his nephew, Rawdon Crawley. Sir Pitt's interest in Miss Sharp seems to be limited to her connection to the wealthy Miss Crawley, who he hopes will leave him a significant portion of her inheritance.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on this text, Sir Pitt Crawley does not come across as a generous person and his dining habits are simple and frugal. He is more concerned with financial gain than with being polite or kind to those around him." />

This suggests that she is not considered equal to the other passengers in terms of status.&#10;2. The young man from Cambridge, who had expected to have the box on the roof and was upset when it was given to Miss Sharp, has to sit up front with Joe. However, he becomes good-humored when Miss Sharp joins him, covering her with one of his greatcoats. This indicates that while there is some animosity towards Miss Sharp's presence initially, the young man eventually warms up to her.&#10;3. The coachman, named Sir Pitt by the Member of Parliament, is unhappy about having to put Miss Sharp's luggage on the roof because he had promised the space to the young man from Cambridge. This shows that even the servants have their own social hierarchies and alliances within the confined space of the carriage.&#10;4. The presence of other passengers, such as an asthmatic gentleman, a prim lady, and possibly Miss MacWhirter's fat coachman, further highlights the cramped and diverse nature of the group. The lively discussions about food, drink, and prosperity suggest that this is not a typical or regular journey for most of them.&#10;&#10;In summary, the seating arrangements and feelings of the passengers in the carriage are characterized by social hierarchies, alliances, and tensions. Miss Sharp's presence disrupts these dynamics initially but eventually helps to create new connections and camaraderie among the group." />

Rebecca has previously served as a governess in Russell Square.&#10;   &#10;2. The notable event concerning Rebecca: In Mrs. Crawley's bulletin from the Hall, it is reported that Rebecca Sharp has taken a regular place in their updates, indicating her growing prominence or acceptance within the household and social circle. Specifically, Rebecca is now featured in the report of the killing of the &quot;black porker,&quot; which could be a reference to a traditional event or task on the estate. This suggests that Rebecca is becoming more integrated into the daily activities and community at Queen's Crawley.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca Sharp is an intelligent governess who has recently joined the Crawley family at Queen's Crawley to educate Sir Pitt's daughters. The notable event concerning Rebecca is her integration into Mrs. Crawley's bulletin from the Hall, signifying her growing prominence and acceptance within the household and community." />

There was always a good glass of ale in the&#10;kitchen of the former place for the Hall people, whose ordinary drink&#10;was very small--and, indeed, the Rector's lady knew exactly how much&#10;malt went to every barrel of Hall beer--ties of relationship existed&#10;between the Hall and Rectory domestics, as between their masters; and&#10;through these channels each family was perfectly well acquainted with&#10;the doings of the other.  That, by the way, may be set down as a&#10;general remark.  When you and your brother are friends, his doings are&#10;indifferent to you.  When you have quarrelled, all his outgoings and&#10;incomings you know, as if you were his spy.&#10;&#10;Very soon then after her arrival, Rebecca began to take a regular place&#10;in Mrs. Crawley's bulletin from the Hall.

    <node id="The narrator implies that in this social circle, being noticed and desired by men is considered more valuable than the approval of other women. The young ladies in Amelia's society, such as the Misses Osborne and the Mesdemoiselles Dobbin, hold her in low esteem and question George's attraction to her. However, they do not seem to affect Amelia's standing or her confidence because she is popular among the men in their social group. The narrator suggests that being &quot;despised&quot; by these women can be seen as a compliment since it might indicate that Amelia has succeeded in attracting male attention, which seems to be more desirable and valuable in this society." />

Well, let us&#10;see if my wits cannot provide me with an honourable maintenance, and if&#10;some day or the other I cannot show Miss Amelia my real superiority&#10;over her. Not that I dislike poor Amelia: who can dislike such a&#10;harmless, good-natured creature?--only it will be a fine day when I can&#10;take my place above her in the world," />

In her interactions with the imaboo-Aid Society and Mr. Crawley, it is revealed that she is descended from the famous Montmorency family on her mother's side. She subtly brings up this connection to impress Mr. Crawley, who finds her stories about her ancestors in D'Hozier's dictionary, which strengthens his belief in their truth and her high-breeding.&#10;&#10;The Montmorency family was a prominent and influential family in France, so Rebecca using this connection shows that she comes from a distinguished background, despite her current situation as a governess. However, she does not reveal to Mr. Crawley that her mother had been on the stage, as it would have shocked his religious scruples.&#10;&#10;In summary, Miss Sharp is the resourceful governess for the Crawley daughters, and she has a connection to the Montmorency family through her mother's side.

In her interactions with the imaboo-Aid Society and Mr. Crawley, it is revealed that she is descended from the famous Montmorency family on her mother's side. She subtly brings up this connection to impress Mr. Crawley, who finds her stories about her ancestors in D'Hozier's dictionary, which strengthens his belief in their truth and her high-breeding.&#10;&#10;The Montmorency family was a prominent and influential family in France, so Rebecca using this connection shows that she comes from a distinguished background, despite her current situation as a governess. However, she does not reveal to Mr. Crawley that her mother had been on the stage, as it would have shocked his religious scruples.&#10;&#10;In summary, Miss Sharp is the resourceful governess for the Crawley daughters, and she has a connection to the Montmorency family through her mother's side. This connection enhances her distinguished background and helps establish her position within the genteel Crawley family and their social circle.">

In disposition he was sociable, and far&#10;from being proud; nay, he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a&#10;horse-dealer to that of a gentleman, like my lord, his son: he was fond&#10;of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was&#10;never known to give away a shilling or to do a good action, but was of&#10;a pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his&#10;glass with a tenant and sell him up the next day; or have his laugh&#10;with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour.  His&#10;politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca&#10;Sharp--in a word, the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England,&#10;did not contain a more cunning, mean, selfish, foolish, disreputable&#10;old man.  That blood-red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in&#10;anybody's pocket except his own; and it is with grief and pain, that,&#10;as admirers of the British aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to&#10;admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name" target="Based on the provided text, the old gentleman, Sir Pitt Crawley, does not seem to be very generous in terms of giving money away. In fact, he states that it is against his principle to give away money (referred to as &quot;farthing&quot; which is a British coin worth a quarter of an old penny). Instead, he prefers to dine frugally and smoke his pipe. His dining habits are described as simple, sharing tripe and onions with Mrs. Tinker, and when the baronet is not at home, Tinker, his butler, is on &quot;board wages,&quot; while Mrs. Tinker dines with the family.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, he displays a lack of politeness towards Rebecca Sharp, addressing her in a condescending manner, making it clear that any favor shown to her is due to her proximity to his nephew, Rawdon Crawley. Sir Pitt's interest in Miss Sharp seems to be limited to her connection to the wealthy Miss Crawley, who he hopes will leave him a significant portion of her inheritance.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on this text, Sir Pitt Crawley does not come across as a generous person and his dining habits are simple and frugal. He is more concerned with financial gain than with being polite or kind to those around him.">

Upon becoming Lady Crawley, Rose Dawson's happiness was primarily derived from her elevated social status and financial security, as she married into a noble family and gained access to wealth and comfort that would have been unattainable otherwise.

The Baronet owed his son&#10;a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother, which he did not find&#10;it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to&#10;paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to discharge his&#10;debts.  Miss Sharp calculated (for she became, as we shall hear&#10;speedily, inducted into most of the secrets of the family) that the&#10;mere payment of his creditors cost the honourable Baronet several&#10;hundreds yearly; but this was a delight he could not forego; he had a&#10;savage pleasure in making the poor wretches wait, and in shifting from&#10;court to court and from term to term the period of satisfaction.&#10;What's the good of being in Parliament, he said, if you must pay your&#10;debts?

Miss Sharp initially takes the back seat inside the carriage, which may have been intended for a servant or other hired help. This suggests that she is not considered equal to the other passengers in terms of status.&#10;2. The young man from Cambridge, who had expected to have the box on the roof and was upset when it was given to Miss Sharp, has to sit up front with Joe. However, he becomes good-humored when Miss Sharp joins him, covering her with one of his greatcoats. This indicates that while there is some animosity towards Miss Sharp's presence initially, the young man eventually warms up to her.&#10;3. The coachman, named Sir Pitt by the Member of Parliament, is unhappy about having to put Miss Sharp's luggage on the roof because he had promised the space to the young man from Cambridge. This shows that even the servants have their own social hierarchies and alliances within the confined space of the carriage.&#10;4. The presence of other passengers, such as an asthmatic gentleman, a prim lady, and possibly Miss MacWhirter's fat coachman, further highlights the cramped and diverse nature of the group. The lively discussions about food, drink, and prosperity suggest that this is not a typical or regular journey for most of them.&#10;&#10;In summary, the seating arrangements and feelings of the passengers in the carriage are characterized by social hierarchies, alliances, and tensions. Miss Sharp's presence disrupts these dynamics initially but eventually helps to create new connections and camaraderie among the group.">

However, he becomes good-humored when Miss Sharp joins him, covering her with one of his greatcoats. This indicates that while there is some animosity towards Miss Sharp's presence initially, the young man eventually warms up to her.&#10;3. The coachman, named Sir Pitt by the Member of Parliament, is unhappy about having to put Miss Sharp's luggage on the roof because he had promised the space to the young man from Cambridge. This shows that even the servants have their own social hierarchies and alliances within the confined space of the carriage.&#10;4. The presence of other passengers, such as an asthmatic gentleman, a prim lady, and possibly Miss MacWhirter's fat coachman, further highlights the cramped and diverse nature of the group. The lively discussions about food, drink, and prosperity suggest that this is not a typical or regular journey for most of them.&#10;&#10;In summary, the seating arrangements and feelings of the passengers in the carriage are characterized by social hierarchies, alliances, and tensions. Miss Sharp's presence disrupts these dynamics initially but eventually helps to create new connections and camaraderie among the group.">

How the junior partner of Hobbs and Dobbs leads her smiling&#10;to the carriage with the lozenge upon it, and the fat wheezy coachman!&#10;How, when she comes to pay us a visit, we generally find an opportunity&#10;to let our friends know her station in the world!  We say (and with&#10;perfect truth) I wish I had Miss MacWhirter" target="Based on the provided text, the old gentleman, Sir Pitt Crawley, does not seem to be very generous in terms of giving money away. In fact, he states that it is against his principle to give away money (referred to as &quot;farthing&quot; which is a British coin worth a quarter of an old penny). Instead, he prefers to dine frugally and smoke his pipe. His dining habits are described as simple, sharing tripe and onions with Mrs. Tinker, and when the baronet is not at home, Tinker, his butler, is on &quot;board wages,&quot; while Mrs. Tinker dines with the family.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, he displays a lack of politeness towards Rebecca Sharp, addressing her in a condescending manner, making it clear that any favor shown to her is due to her proximity to his nephew, Rawdon Crawley. Sir Pitt's interest in Miss Sharp seems to be limited to her connection to the wealthy Miss Crawley, who he hopes will leave him a significant portion of her inheritance.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on this text, Sir Pitt Crawley does not come across as a generous person and his dining habits are simple and frugal. He is more concerned with financial gain than with being polite or kind to those around him.">

    <edge source="Based on the provided text, the old gentleman, Sir Pitt Crawley, does not seem to be very generous in terms of giving money away. In fact, he states that it is against his principle to give away money (referred to as &quot;farthing&quot; which is a British coin worth a quarter of an old penny). Instead, he prefers to dine frugally and smoke his pipe. His dining habits are described as simple, sharing tripe and onions with Mrs. Tinker, and when the baronet is not at home, Tinker, his butler, is on &quot;board wages,&quot; while Mrs. Tinker dines with the family.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, he displays a lack of politeness towards Rebecca Sharp, addressing her in a condescending manner, making it clear that any favor shown to her is due to her proximity to his nephew, Rawdon Crawley. Sir Pitt's interest in Miss Sharp seems to be limited to her connection to the wealthy Miss Crawley, who he hopes will leave him a significant portion of her inheritance.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on this text, Sir Pitt Crawley does not come across as a generous person and his dining habits are simple and frugal.

By Jove!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bute Crawley, you are a fool,&quot; said the Rector's wife scornfully.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Ma'am, fool or not--and I don't say, Martha, I'm so clever as&#10;you are, I never did.  But I won't meet Rawdon Crawley, that's flat.&#10;I'll go over to Huddleston, that I will, and see his black greyhound,&#10;Mrs. Craw">

    <edge source="The Rector's wife is referred to as &quot;the Rector's wife&quot; throughout the narrative. She is not given a name, but we learn that she is intelligent, wise, and influential in her household. She writes her husband's sermons, manages their finances, and tries to keep him from accumulating debt due to his spending habits. She is also shown to be concerned about her family's reputation and the company they keep, opposing her husband's decision to invite Rawdon Crawley to their home." target=" Mrs. Bute Crawley, first cousin to&#10;the Earl of Tiptoff, who won't condescend to visit Lady Crawley, except&#10;when her sister is in the country.  Poor Lady Crawley! during most part&#10;of these gaieties, she is upstairs taking pills.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute has all of a sudden taken a great fancy to me.  &quot;My dear Miss&#10;Sharp,&quot; she says, &quot;why not bring over your girls to the Rectory?--their&#10;cousins will be so happy to see them.&quot; I know what she means.  Signor&#10;Clementi did not teach us the piano for nothing; at which price Mrs.&#10;Bute hopes to get a professor for her children. I can see through her&#10;schemes, as though she told them to me; but I shall go, as I am&#10;determined to make myself agreeable--is it not a poor governess's duty,&#10;who has not a friend or protector in the world? The Rector's wife paid&#10;me a score of compliments about the progress my pupils made, and&#10;thought, no doubt, to touch my heart--poor, simple, country soul!--as&#10;if I cared a fig about">

    <edge source="Miss Tuffin and Miss Letitia Hawky are two ladies who are qualified to serve as governesses for Sir Huddleston Fuddleston's family. Miss Tuffin is proficient in the use of globes, instructing in Syriac language, and the elements of Constitutional law. She is 18 years old, with an exceedingly pleasing personal appearance. Her terms are not specified but are likely high, given her qualifications and youthful appeal.&#10;&#10;Miss Letitia Hawky, on the other hand, is not as favorably described in terms of physical appearance. She is 29 years old, has a face pitted with smallpox, a halt in her gait, red hair, and a trifling obliquity of vision. However, she shares Miss Tuffin's moral and religious virtues. Her terms are also not specified.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the narrator mentions Miss Hawky's physical appearance as a contrast to Miss Tuffin's, which may suggest that her looks could be perceived as less desirable in a governess. However, both ladies are deemed qualified and suitable for the role of instructing Sir Huddleston Fuddleston's daughters based on their qualifications and virtues." target=". 'Tis most gratifying to one&#10;in my most arduous position to find that my maternal cares have&#10;elicited a responsive affection; and to recognize in the amiable Mrs.&#10;Bute Crawley my excellent pupil of former years, the sprightly and&#10;accomplished Miss Martha MacTavish.  I am happy to have under my charge&#10;now the daughters of many of those who were your contemporaries at my&#10;establishment--what pleasure it would give me if your own beloved young&#10;ladies had need of my instructive superintendence!&#10;&#10;Presenting my respectful compliments to Lady Fuddleston, I have the&#10;honour (epistolarily) to introduce to her ladyship my two friends, Miss&#10;Tuffin and Miss Hawky.&#10;&#10;Either of these young ladies is PERFECTLY QUALIFIED to instruct in&#10;Greek, Latin, and the rudiments of Hebrew; in mathematics and history;&#10;in Spanish, French, Italian, and geography; in music, vocal and&#10;instrumental; in dancing, without the aid of a master; and in the&#10;elements of natural sciences.  In the use of the globes both are&#10;proficients.">

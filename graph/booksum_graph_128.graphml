    <node id="Based on the information provided, Oliver Twist, the protagonist of the story, is currently in a state of sleep on a makeshift bed. The setting is at the residence of Fagin, a Jewish man involved in criminal activities who has been taking care of Oliver. The exact location of Fagin's residence is not specified, but it can be inferred that it is a place where he conducts his illegal operations, and where he houses and trains children like Oliver for theft.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the makeshift bed indicates that Oliver is not being treated as a guest or with any degree of comfort. The use of the word &quot;rude&quot; suggests that it is a simple and likely uncomfortable surface for sleeping. This detail reflects Oliver's status as someone who is not valued or respected, but rather seen as a tool for Fagin's criminal activities.&#10;&#10;In summary, at the time of the speaker's arrival, Oliver Twist is asleep on a makeshift bed in the residence of Fagin, where he has been living under the care of the Jewish thief and being prepared for a life of crime." />

They waited, while the person who had&#10;let them in, chained and barred the door.&#10;&#10;'Anybody here?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;'No,' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.&#10;&#10;'Is the old 'un here?' asked the robber.&#10;&#10;'Yes,' replied the voice, 'and precious down in the mouth he has been.&#10;Won't he be glad to see you?  Oh, no!'&#10;&#10;The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,&#10;seemed familiar to Oliver's ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish&#10;even the form of the speaker in the darkness.&#10;&#10;'Let's have a glim,' said Sikes, 'or we shall go breaking our necks, or&#10;treading on the dog.  Look after your legs if you do!'&#10;&#10;'Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one,' replied the voice. The&#10;receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,&#10;the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise" />
    <node id=" he drew his chair to the&#10;fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of&#10;discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.&#10;&#10;The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the&#10;following advertisement.&#10;&#10;                 'FIVE GUINEAS REWARD&#10;&#10;'Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on&#10;Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since&#10;been heard of.  The above reward will be paid to any person who will&#10;give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver&#10;Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which&#10;the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.'&#10;&#10;And then followed a full description of Oliver's dress, person,&#10;appearance, and disappearance:  with the name and address of Mr.&#10;Brownlow at full length.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and&#10;carefully, three several times; and in something more than" />

Oliver&#10;stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on&#10;a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before&#10;it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.&#10;&#10;For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy&#10;might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the&#10;girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to&#10;trim the light.  Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell&#10;asleep.&#10;&#10;When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was&#10;thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which&#10;hung over the back of a chair.  Nancy was busily engaged in preparing&#10;breakfast.  It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning,&#10;and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against&#10;the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.&#10;&#10;'Now, then!' growled Sikes, as" />

'Here he is!'&#10;&#10;The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale&#10;with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he&#10;looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in&#10;the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle&#10;spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the&#10;world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.&#10;&#10;'Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away.  'To-morrow. To-morrow.'&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find&#10;that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at&#10;his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was&#10;pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of&#10;his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting&#10;down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and&#10;manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the" />

'Wait till Bill tells you, then.'&#10;&#10;The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater&#10;curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt&#10;very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of&#10;Fagin's looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries&#10;just then.  He had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very&#10;surly and silent till night:  when he prepared to go abroad.&#10;&#10;'You may burn a candle,' said the Jew, putting one upon the table.&#10;'And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.&#10;Good-night!'&#10;&#10;'Good-night!' replied Oliver" />

Not to stop there,' replied the Jew.  'We shouldn't&#10;like to lose you.  Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us&#10;again.  Ha! ha! ha!  We won't be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.&#10;Oh no, no!'&#10;&#10;The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,&#10;looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show&#10;that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.&#10;&#10;'I suppose,' said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, 'you want to know&#10;what you're going to Bill's for---eh, my dear?'&#10;&#10;Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been&#10;reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes," />
    <node id="Bill Sikes and Nancy hear the sound of a church-bell striking eight o'clock, and Nancy remarks that it is Bartlemy time. Sikes responds gruffly, but Nancy wonders whether &quot;they&quot; can hear the bell. She is referring to the young chimney sweeps who work during the day and are often locked up in confined spaces at night, their fate being similar to what could have happened to Oliver if Sikes had not taken him in. The &quot;fine young chaps&quot; phrase suggests a sense of empathy or concern from Nancy towards these children, but Sikes dismisses her concerns and focuses on his own plans." />
    <node id="ikes.  'It was Bartlemy time when I was&#10;shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't&#10;hear the squeaking on.  Arter I was locked up for the night, the row&#10;and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could&#10;almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.'&#10;&#10;'Poor fellow!' said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the&#10;quarter in which the bell had sounded.  'Oh, Bill, such fine young&#10;chaps as them!'&#10;&#10;'Yes; that's all you women think of,' answered Sikes.  'Fine young&#10;chaps!  Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.'&#10;&#10;With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency&#10;to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him to step&#10;out again.&#10;&#10;'Wait a minute!' said the girl:  'I wouldn't hurry by, if it was you&#10;that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o'clock struck,&#10;Bill.  I'd walk round and" />

'Oh!  That's the time of day.  Come on!'&#10;&#10;This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty&#10;welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes' temperament.  Nancy, appearing&#10;much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.&#10;&#10;'Bull's-eye's gone home with Tom,' observed Sikes, as he lighted them&#10;up.  'He'd have been in the way.'&#10;&#10;'That's right,' rejoined Nancy.&#10;&#10;'So you've got the kid,' said Sikes when they had all reached the room:&#10;closing the door as he spoke.&#10;&#10;'Yes, here he is,' replied Nancy.&#10;&#10;'Did he come quiet?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;'Like a lamb,' rejoined Nancy.&#10;&#10;'I'm glad to hear it,' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; 'for the&#10;sake of" />

Speak out, and call things by their right names; don't sit&#10;there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you&#10;warn't the very first that thought about the robbery.  Wot d'ye mean?'&#10;&#10;'Hush, Bill, hush!' said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop&#10;this burst of indignation; 'somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody&#10;will hear us.'&#10;&#10;'Let 'em hear!' said Sikes; 'I don't care.'  But as Mr. Sikes DID care,&#10;on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew&#10;calmer.&#10;&#10;'There, there,' said the Jew, coaxingly.  'It was only my caution,&#10;nothing more.  Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to&#10;be done, Bill, eh?  When is it to be" />
    <node id="&#10;for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.&#10;&#10;It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been&#10;Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night&#10;was dark and foggy.  The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle&#10;through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the&#10;streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger&#10;in Oliver's eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and&#10;depressing.&#10;&#10;They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the&#10;hour.  With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned&#10;their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.&#10;&#10;'Eight o' clock, Bill,' said Nancy, when the bell ceased.&#10;&#10;'What's the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can't I!' replied&#10;Sikes.&#10;&#10;'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,' said Nancy.&#10;&#10;'Of course they can,' replied Sikes.  'It was Bartlemy time when I was&#10;shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't" />

'This is powder; that 'ere's&#10;a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin'.'&#10;&#10;Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;&#10;and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and&#10;deliberation.&#10;&#10;'Now it" />
    <node id=". Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal&#10;pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy&#10;to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and&#10;threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the&#10;fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the&#10;object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more&#10;tangible arguments.&#10;&#10;'What do you mean by this?' said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very&#10;common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:&#10;which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand&#10;times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a&#10;disorder as measles: 'what do you mean by it?  Burn my body!  Do you&#10;know who you are, and what you are?'&#10;&#10;'Oh, yes, I know all about it,' replied the girl, laughing&#10;hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor&#10;assumption of indifference.&#10;&#10;'Well, then, keep quiet,' rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was&#10;accustomed to" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Sikes, Fagin, and Nancy are discussing arrangements for a burglary that Sikes and an accomplice named Toby plan to commit the following night. The target of the burglary is not specified in this excerpt. Fagin reminds Sikes about the need to bring the &quot;swag&quot; (stolen goods) and keep the melting-pot ready for the stolen items. &#10;&#10;Nancy is tasked with going to the Jew's den the following night when it has set in, and bringing Oliver along with her. Fagin suggests that if Oliver shows any reluctance to accompany Nancy, he would be more willing to go with her since she had recently interfered on his behalf. It is also agreed upon that Sikes will take full responsibility for Oliver during the burglary and deal with him as he sees fit.&#10;&#10;In summary, Nancy's role in Fagin and Sikes' plans is to bring Oliver to the Jew's den and turn him over to Sikes' care and custody for the purpose of carrying out a burglary the following night." />

'Never&#10;mind particulars.  You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night.  I&#10;shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.  Then you hold your&#10;tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that's all you'll have to&#10;do.'&#10;&#10;After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was&#10;decided that Nancy should repair to the" />

'Bill!'&#10;&#10;'What now?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the&#10;fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave&#10;the room.  Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought&#10;the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting&#10;Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.&#10;&#10;'You don't want any beer,' said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining&#10;her seat very composedly.&#10;&#10;'I tell you I do!' replied Sikes.&#10;&#10;'Nonsense,' rejoined the girl coolly, 'Go on, Fagin.  I know what he's&#10;going to say, Bill; he needn't mind me.'&#10;&#10;The Jew still hesitated.  Sikes looked from one to the other in some&#10;surprise.&#10;&#10;'Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?' he asked at length.&#10;'You've known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil's in it.  She&#10;ain't one to blab.  Are you Nancy?'" />
    <node id="'ll have to&#10;do.'&#10;&#10;After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was&#10;decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the&#10;night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily&#10;observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would&#10;be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in&#10;his behalf, than anybody else.  It was also solemnly arranged that poor&#10;Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be&#10;unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;&#10;and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought&#10;fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or&#10;evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to&#10;render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by&#10;Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and&#10;corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash&#10;Toby Crackit.&#10;&#10;These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brand" />
    <node id="gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and&#10;resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.&#10;&#10;'Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh.  'Tell Bill at once, about&#10;Oliver!'&#10;&#10;'Ha! you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!' said&#10;the Jew, patting her on the neck.  'It WAS about Oliver I was going to&#10;speak, sure enough.  Ha! ha! ha!'&#10;&#10;'What about him?' demanded Sikes.&#10;&#10;'He's the boy for you, my dear,' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;&#10;laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.&#10;&#10;'He!' exclaimed Sikes.&#10;&#10;'Have him, Bill!' said Nancy.  'I would, if I was in your place. He&#10;mayn't be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you&#10;want, if he's only to open a door for you.  Depend upon it he's a safe&#10;one, Bill.'&#10;&#10;'I know he is,' rejoined Fagin" />
    <node id=" after a pause, during&#10;which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted&#10;manner; 'you,--you're more clever than ever to-night.  Ha! ha! my dear,&#10;you are acting beautifully.'&#10;&#10;'Am I!' said the girl.  'Take care I don't overdo it.  You will be the&#10;worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep&#10;clear of me.'&#10;&#10;There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all&#10;her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and&#10;despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be&#10;hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss&#10;Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a&#10;glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that&#10;he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal&#10;pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy&#10;to reason;" />
    <node id="The subject matter of the book that the man in the text begins to read is a history of the lives and trials of great criminals. The descriptions of dreadful crimes and secret murders are so real and vivid that they make him feel terrified, and he becomes fully absorbed in the volume. However, his attention is abruptly interrupted when he is attacked and accused of stealing the books. The violent and sudden shift in the scene and the man's emotions reflect the &quot;abrupt impulses of passion or feeling&quot; that are often seen in theater and literature but may seem unnatural in real life." />
    <node id="'And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.&#10;Good-night!'&#10;&#10;'Good-night!' replied Oliver, softly.&#10;&#10;The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he&#10;went.  Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.&#10;&#10;Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to&#10;light it.  He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table,&#10;saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and&#10;contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.&#10;&#10;'Take heed, Oliver! take heed!' said the old man, shaking his right&#10;hand before him in a warning manner.  'He's a rough man, and thinks&#10;nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing;&#10;and do what he bids you.  Mind!'  Placing a strong emphasis on the last&#10;word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a&#10;ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.&#10;&#10;Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared" />
    <node id="Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would&#10;seem at first sight.  The transitions in real life from well-spread&#10;boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are&#10;not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of&#10;passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference.  The actors in the&#10;mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt&#10;impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of&#10;mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.&#10;&#10;As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place,&#10;are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many&#10;considered as the great art of authorship: an author's skill in his&#10;craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the&#10;dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter:&#10;this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed&#10;unnecessary.

It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals;&#10;and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of&#10;dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that&#10;had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye&#10;of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as&#10;they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so&#10;maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had&#10;confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.&#10;Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night,&#10;had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts,&#10;to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs&#10;quail, to think of.

With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and&#10;struck him on the head.&#10;&#10;'That's right!' cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. 'That's the&#10;only way of bringing him to his senses!'&#10;&#10;'To be sure!' cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look&#10;at the garret-window.&#10;&#10;'It'll do him good!' said the two women.&#10;&#10;'And he shall have it, too!' rejoined the man, administering another&#10;blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.

You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading.&#10;If you ain't, sell 'em.'&#10;&#10;'They're very pretty,' said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,&#10;had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; 'beautiful&#10;writing, isn't is, Oliver?'  At sight of the dismayed look with which&#10;Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a&#10;lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more&#10;boisterous than the first.&#10;&#10;'They belong to the old gentleman,' said Oliver, wringing his hands;&#10;'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had&#10;me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.

He&#10;was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where&#10;he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.

    <node id="In the discussion among Fagin, Sikes, and Nancy, they are making arrangements for a burglary and deciding that Nancy will bring Oliver to the Jew's den. They believe that if Oliver shows any reluctance to accompany Nancy, he would be more willing to go with her since she had recently interfered on his behalf. Fagin and Nancy consider Oliver a &quot;safe&quot; choice for the burglary because, even though he may not be as skilled as others, he can open a door for them, and they perceive him as unlikely to cause trouble or alert anyone during the crime. This assessment of Oliver's character highlights the group's manipulation of his innocence and vulnerability for their own criminal purposes." />

However, they discovered one part of the house that can be &quot;cracked, safe and softly&quot; as they cross the lawn.

When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a&#10;by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his&#10;mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in&#10;the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and&#10;so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.&#10;&#10;He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to&#10;feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick,&#10;who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;&#10;when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.

Having had his face put under&#10;the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he was led into the awful&#10;presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.&#10;&#10;The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large&#10;and bright.  The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung&#10;loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like&#10;those of an old man.&#10;&#10;Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's&#10;glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even&#10;to hear the beadle's voice.&#10;&#10;'Can't you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?' said Mrs. Mann.&#10;&#10;The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.&#10;&#10;'What's the matter with you, porochial Dick?' inquired Mr. Bumble, with&#10;well-timed jocularity.&#10;&#10;'Nothing, sir,' replied the child faintly.&#10;&#10;'I should think not,' said Mrs." />
    <node id="Mr. Bumble justifies transporting sick paupers in open carts during rainy weather by saying it is to prevent them from taking cold.

'They are both in a very low state, and we find it&#10;would come two pound cheaper to move 'em than to bury 'em--that is, if&#10;we can throw 'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to&#10;do, if they don't die upon the road to spite us.  Ha! ha! ha!'&#10;&#10;When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered&#10;the cocked hat; and he became grave.&#10;&#10;'We are forgetting business, ma'am,' said the beadle; 'here is your&#10;porochial stipend for the month.'&#10;&#10;Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his&#10;pocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote.&#10;&#10;'It's very much blotted, sir,' said the farmer of infants; 'but it's&#10;formal enough, I" />

    <node id="In the passage, Oliver is accused of stealing books and subsequently attacked by a man. The attack is witnessed by several onlookers, who approve of the man's actions and even encourage further violence. The man snatches the books from Oliver, strikes him on the head, and seizes him by the collar. He then calls his dog, Bull's-eye, to &quot;mind him, boy!&quot; The scene is chaotic and violent, leaving Oliver weak, stupefied, and terrified due to his recent illness and the suddenness of the attack. The man's emotional state shifts abruptly from being immersed in a book about criminals to attacking an innocent boy, which can be seen as an example of &quot;abrupt impulses of passion or feeling&quot; often found in literature and theater but less common in real life." />
    <node id="The young girl, Nancy, is taking desperate measures to protect both herself and Oliver by quickly leading him away from the dangerous situation with Bill Sikes and Toby.

Nancy is likely protecting Oliver from Sikes's abusive nature, as suggested by her bruises, and from being further involved in their criminal activities. They are hurried away to an unknown destination, where it is implied that Nancy might try to find help or a safer place for Oliver." />

And don't let me suffer more for you, just now. If I&#10;could help you, I would; but I have not the power.  They don't mean to&#10;harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours.  Hush!&#10;Every word from you is a blow for me.  Give me your hand.  Make haste!&#10;Your hand!'&#10;&#10;She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,&#10;blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was&#10;opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as&#10;quickly closed, when they had passed out.  A hackney-cabriolet was in&#10;waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing&#10;Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her," />
    <node id="; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the&#10;open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if&#10;there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,&#10;perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open&#10;space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other&#10;indications of a cattle-market.  Sikes slackened his pace when they&#10;reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer,&#10;the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.  Turning to Oliver,&#10;he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy's hand.&#10;&#10;'Do you hear?' growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.&#10;&#10;They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.&#10;&#10;Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail.  He&#10;held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.&#10;&#10;'Give me the other,' said Sikes, seizing Oliver's unoccupied hand.&#10;'Here, Bull's-Eye!'&#10;" />
    <node id="The speaker in the passage is rousing Barney in such a manner to quickly get his attention and make sure he is awake to attend to the newly arrived Bill Sikes. The speaker seems annoyed that Barney is sleeping, suggesting it is inconvenient or improper for him to do so, possibly because Sikes has come for a specific purpose and needs assistance. By throwing an object and threatening to use an iron candlestick, the speaker emphasizes the urgency of the situation and ensures that Barney will be prompt in responding to Sikes." />

'There's Bill Sikes in the&#10;passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as&#10;if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.

'The game of&#10;that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,&#10;who's got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels&#10;wakeful.  Ha! ha!

    <node id="The five-pound note in this passage represents the share of the burglary proceeds that belong to Bill Sikes. The exchange between Fagin, Bill Sikes, and the Artful Dodger highlights their criminal behavior and their willingness to manipulate others, including Oliver, for their own gain. When Sikes becomes suspicious that Fagin has kept some of the money for himself, Fagin quickly produces the rest of Sikes' share, which he had hidden in a handkerchief. The exchange also reveals the power dynamic between Sikes and Fagin, with Sikes implying that Fagin is more dependent on him than he is on Fagin. Overall, the five-pound note and the exchange between the characters serve to emphasize their criminality and their lack of trust in each other." />

We'd have got something warm for&#10;supper.'&#10;&#10;At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,&#10;and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound&#10;note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery&#10;awakened his merriment.&#10;&#10;'Hallo, what's that?' inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew&#10;seized the note.  'That's mine, Fagin.'&#10;&#10;'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew.  'Mine, Bill, mine.

'Don't put on an&#10;injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the&#10;tinkler.'&#10;&#10;These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.&#10;It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile&#10;and repulsive in appearance.&#10;&#10;Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew, perfectly&#10;understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a&#10;remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if&#10;in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the&#10;action would have been almost impercept" />

'Well, what have you got to say to me?'&#10;&#10;'It's all passed safe through the melting-pot,' replied Fagin, 'and&#10;this is your share.

'Where is it?&#10;Hand over!'&#10;&#10;'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew,&#10;soothingly.  'Here it is!  All safe!'

'This hasn't go anything to do with young Green&#10;here.'&#10;&#10;'No more it has,' said Charley.  'Why don't you put yourself under&#10;Fagin, Oliver?'&#10;&#10;'And make your fortun' out of hand?' added the Dodger, with a grin.&#10;&#10;'And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I&#10;mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the&#10;forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,' said Charley Bates.&#10;&#10;'I don't like it,' rejoined Oliver, timidly; 'I wish they would let me&#10;go.

'Lie down, you stupid brute!&#10;Don't you know the devil when he's got a great-coat on?'&#10;&#10;Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer&#10;garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a&#10;chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen:  wagging his&#10;tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his&#10;nature to be.&#10;&#10;'Well!' said Sikes.&#10;&#10;'Well, my dear,' replied the Jew.--'Ah!

In about ten minutes'&#10;time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy&#10;pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.&#10;Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,&#10;expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,&#10;followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard&#10;as soon as his master was out of sight.&#10;&#10;The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;&#10;looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched&#10;fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a" />

He has small twinkling eyes and a pock-marked face, and he wears a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe is in disrepair, which he attributes to the new way of fumigating clothes and the regulation mode of cutting hair at the place where he has been staying, which he considers to be unconstitutional and unlawful. He also mentions that he hasn't had anything to drink for forty-two days and wishes he were as dry as a lime-basket.&#10;&#10;As for Oliver's relationship with the gentleman who just arrived, it is not explicitly stated in the passage you provided. The gentleman, who is referred to as &quot;the last comer,&quot; exchanges some words with Fagin before they all sit down by the fire. Fagin then tells Oliver to come and sit by him and leads the conversation to topics that would interest his hearers, one of whom is the newcomer. The gentleman makes a sly remark about Oliver being &quot;in luck&quot; and says that he will soon find his way to wherever the gentleman came from, suggesting some sort of connection or shared experience between them. However, the exact nature of their relationship is not revealed in this passage." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had&#10;returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver&#10;had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom&#10;Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few&#10;gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.&#10;&#10;Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps&#10;numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his&#10;deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that&#10;he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius&#10;and professional aquirements.  He had small twinkling eyes, and a&#10;pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy&#10;fustian trousers, and an apron.  His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out&#10;of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his&#10;'time' was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having&#10;worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow&#10;any attention on his private clothes." />
    <node id=" that, in consequence of having&#10;worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow&#10;any attention on his private clothes.  Mr. Chitling added, with strong&#10;marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder&#10;was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there&#10;was no remedy against the County.  The same remark he considered to&#10;apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be&#10;decidedly unlawful.  Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating&#10;that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long&#10;hard-working days; and that he 'wished he might be busted if he warn't&#10;as dry as a lime-basket.'&#10;&#10;'Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?' inquired the&#10;Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the&#10;table.&#10;&#10;'I--I--don't know, sir,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Who's that?' inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at&#10;Oliver.&#10;&#10;'A young friend of mine, my" />

After some more jokes on the same&#10;subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.&#10;&#10;After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew&#10;their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and&#10;sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to&#10;interest his hearers.  These were, the great advantages of the trade,&#10;the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the&#10;liberality of the Jew himself.  At length these subjects displayed&#10;signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same:&#10;for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two.&#10;" />

He presents papers that confirm Oliver's identity and explains that the boy had run away from his home at Pentonville and was believed to have made a sanguinary (bloody) and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad. Mr. Bumble's true feelings of ingratitude and malice towards Oliver are revealed as he pockets the five guineas offered to him for his intelligence." />
    <node id=", ingratitude, and malice.  That he had terminated his brief&#10;career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly&#10;attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from&#10;his master's house.  In proof of his really being the person he&#10;represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had&#10;brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow's&#10;observations.&#10;&#10;'I fear it is all too true,' said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after&#10;looking over the papers.  'This is not much for your intelligence; but&#10;I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been&#10;favourable to the boy.'&#10;&#10;It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this&#10;information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have&#10;imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too&#10;late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and,&#10;pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and" />
    <node id=" so he shook his head gravely, and,&#10;pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so&#10;much disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to&#10;vex him further.&#10;&#10;At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.&#10;&#10;'Mrs. Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; 'that&#10;boy, Oliver, is an imposter.'&#10;&#10;'It can't be, sir.  It cannot be,' said the old lady energetically.&#10;&#10;'I tell you he is,' retorted the old gentleman.  'What do you mean by&#10;can't be?  We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and&#10;he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.'&#10;&#10;'I never will believe it, sir,' replied the old lady, firmly. 'Never!'&#10;&#10;'You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying&#10;story-books,' growled Mr. Grimwig.  'I knew it all along. Why didn't&#10;you take my advise" />
    <node id="Mr. Sikes has a negative opinion of the Juvenile Delinquent Society and their impact on the trade of young chimney sweepers. He believes that instead of allowing these children to work in their trades, the society takes them away to teach them to read, write, and become apprentices. Sikes feels that this results in a decrease in the number of available workers in the trade and that it is a good thing that the society does not have enough money to do this for all young chimney sweepers. He specifically mentions his frustration about losing a young chimney sweeper he had kept small on purpose, who was taken away by the society after the father was caught and lagged (imprisoned)." />
    <node id="ot it is!' replied Sikes.  'I want a boy, and he musn't be&#10;a big 'un.  Lord!' said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, 'if I'd only got that&#10;young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's!  He kept him small on&#10;purpose, and let him out by the job.  But the father gets lagged; and&#10;then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from&#10;a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and&#10;in time makes a 'prentice of him.  And so they go on,' said Mr. Sikes,&#10;his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, 'so they go on;&#10;and, if they'd got money enough (which it's a Providence they haven't,)&#10;we shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year&#10;or two.'&#10;&#10;'No more we should,' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering&#10;during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. 'Bill!'&#10;&#10;'What now?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy," />
    <node id="Nancy is intervening on Oliver's behalf in the narrative due to a combination of guilt for her role in his exploitation and a sense of compassion for his vulnerable situation. As an active participant in Fagin's criminal network, Nancy has witnessed firsthand the group's manipulation of Oliver's innocence and vulnerability for their own criminal purposes. This exposure to Oliver's mistreatment, along with the bruises she bears, which may suggest a history of abuse at the hands of Bill Sikes, culminates in her decision to spirit Oliver away from the dangerous situation with Sikes and Toby.&#10;&#10;Fagin and Sikes are taken aback by Nancy's behavior because they did not anticipate her intervention on Oliver's behalf. They had perceived Oliver as a useful and controllable tool for their criminal activities, and her decision to protect him threatens the stability of their plans. Furthermore, her defiance challenges the power dynamic within the group and highlights potential divisions among its members, which could potentially lead to its downfall." />
    <node id="Nancy is distressed due to the dangerous situation she and Oliver are in with Bill Sikes, a violent criminal who is part of their gang. She is also feeling emotional because she has found Oliver after he ran away from his real family, who are hard-working and respectable people. Nancy wants to protect Oliver and help him, but she is limited by her own involvement in the criminal underworld and Sikes's abusive nature.&#10;&#10;Oliver cannot directly help Nancy in her distress, as he is also in danger and being coerced by Sikes. However, his innocence and lack of involvement in their crimes may serve as a reminder for Nancy to seek a better life and leave the criminal world behind. Additionally, Oliver's eventual escape from Sikes and return to his real family could indirectly help Nancy by prompting her to consider the consequences of her actions and make amends for her past wrongdoings." />
    <node id="Mr. Sikes threats Oliver by implying that if he doesn't comply with his instructions, he will shoot and kill him. He says this while loading a pistol and pointing it at Oliver, making his intention very clear. By saying &quot;there isn't anyone who would particularly inquire about Oliver's disappearance,&quot; Sikes implies that no one would miss or look for Oliver if he were to disappear or be killed, suggesting that Oliver is either on his own in the world or that his absence wouldn't be noticed by those close to him. This further emphasizes the danger and urgency of the situation for Oliver." />
    <node id="Nancy appears at Oliver's door in a distressed state due to the dangerous situation involving Bill Sikes, a violent criminal with whom she is associated. She has realized that her decision to rescue Oliver from Sikes' abusive nature and criminal activities may have unintended consequences, which could be the cause of her distress and difficulty breathing. Upon seeing Nancy, Oliver expresses concern for her well-being and offers help, but he cannot directly resolve the situation as he is also in danger.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Nancy's reference to &quot;Bartlemy time&quot; and the chimney sweeps suggests that she may be feeling empathy or guilt for being involved in a criminal underworld that exploits children like Oliver and the young chimney sweeps. The sound of the church-bell striking eight o'clock reminds her of their plight, further contributing to her emotional state. Overall, Nancy's appearance at Oliver's door is due to a combination of factors, including her involvement with Sikes, her concern for Oliver, and her empathy towards other exploited children." />
    <node id="After exchanging his cocked hat for a round one and donning a blue great-coat, Mr. Bumble experienced some discomfort during his journey to London due to the shivering and complaints about the cold from the criminals accompanying him. Once he had 'disposed of' them for the night, he sat down for a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. He then settled by the fire with a glass of hot gin-and-water, reflecting on what he considered to be the sin of discontent and complaining. This shows Mr. Bumble's self-satisfaction and lack of empathy for the hardships of others, even when he himself has taken steps to ensure their comfort less adequately than his own." />
    <node id="Mr. Bumble, the parish beadle, came to see Mr. Brownlow and Mr. Grimwig in response to an advertisement offering a reward for information about Oliver Twist. The advertisement caught Mr. Bumble's attention because he had previously been involved with Oliver's care at the parish workhouse. He responded to the advertisement because he had learned through his own inquiries that Oliver might be connected to Mr. Brownlow. When Mr. Bumble meets Mr. Brownlow, he reveals that he has information about Oliver's past and begins to share it with the two gentlemen.&#10;&#10;The reason Mr. Grimwig exclaims that Mr. Bumble is a beadle is because of his appearance and demeanor. In the excerpt provided, we can see how Mr. Grimwig makes this remark after attentively observing Mr. Bumble's features. The text suggests that Mr. Grimwig recognizes Mr. Bumble as a typical beadle due to his appearance and mannerisms, indicating that Mr. Bumble fits the stereotypical image of a beadle of the time period. A beadle was an official in charge of maintaining order within a parish workhouse or church, often depicted in literature as pompous and self-important figures." />
    <node id="Nancy reassures the Jew and Sikes by laughing off the Jew's suspicion and making defiant exclamations to show that she is still committed to their criminal activities, despite her previous emotional outburst. She does this to re-assure them that she will not expose their plans or betray their trust, which is essential for her to maintain her position within their group. By declaring &quot;Keep the game a-going!&quot; and &quot;Never say die!&quot;, she is expressing her determination to continue with their criminal activities and her commitment to their group, even in the face of challenges or setbacks. This helps to dispel any doubts that Sikes or the Jew may have about her loyalty and reliability." />
    <node id="You've known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil's in it.  She&#10;ain't one to blab.  Are you Nancy?'&#10;&#10;'_I_ should think not!' replied the young lady:  drawing her chair up&#10;to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.&#10;&#10;'No, no, my dear, I know you're not,' said the Jew; 'but--' and again&#10;the old man paused.&#10;&#10;'But wot?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;'I didn't know whether she mightn't p'r'aps be out of sorts, you know,&#10;my dear, as she was the other night,' replied the Jew.&#10;&#10;At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing&#10;a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst&#10;into sundry exclamations of 'Keep the game a-going!'  'Never say die!'&#10;and the like.  These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both&#10;gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and&#10;resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.&#10;&#10;" />

After ruminating for some&#10;minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said,&#10;with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared&#10;the game was up.&#10;&#10;'And yet,' said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, 'it's a&#10;sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.'&#10;&#10;'So it is,' said Mr. Sikes.  'Worse luck!'&#10;&#10;A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep&#10;thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy&#10;perfectly demoniacal.  Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.&#10;Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her&#10;eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.&#10;&#10;'Fagin,' said S" />

However, they discovered one part of the house that can be &quot;cracked, safe and softly&quot; as they cross the lawn. This location is not explicitly stated in the text, but it suggests that Sikes and Toby plan to enter the house through a weak point or an unguarded entrance.

This exposure to Oliver's mistreatment, along with the bruises she bears, which may suggest a history of abuse at the hands of Bill Sikes, culminates in her decision to spirit Oliver away from the dangerous situation with Sikes and Toby.&#10;&#10;Fagin and Sikes are taken aback by Nancy's behavior because they did not anticipate her intervention on Oliver's behalf.

This incident frightens Oliver, causing him to hastily swallow the drink in order to avoid the menacing gestures of the two men. Toby, in response to Oliver's appeal, tells Sikes to have mercy on him, suggesting that he is concerned for Oliver's well-being.&#10;&#10;Fagin reacts to Oliver's plea by ignoring it and telling Sikes to take care of him during the burglary as he sees fit. This shows that Fagin does not care about Oliver's well-being and is willing to put him in harm's way for his own criminal purposes. It also highlights the group's manipulation of Oliver's innocence and vulnerability for their own gain. Overall, Fagin's reaction to Oliver's plea emphasizes his lack of compassion and disregard for the boy's well-being.">

The man snatches the books from Oliver, strikes him on the head, and seizes him by the collar. He then calls his dog, Bull's-eye, to &quot;mind him, boy!&quot; The scene is chaotic and violent, leaving Oliver weak, stupefied, and terrified due to his recent illness and the suddenness of the attack. The man's emotional state shifts abruptly from being immersed in a book about criminals to attacking an innocent boy, which can be seen as an example of &quot;abrupt impulses of passion or feeling&quot; often found in literature and theater but less common in real life." target="The boy, Oliver Twist, prays for deliverance and protection after closing the book about the lives and trials of great criminals because the detailed and vivid descriptions of terrible crimes and murders made him feel terrified and fearful. He was emotionally overwhelmed by the graphic content and feared becoming involved in such criminal actions. Therefore, he prayed to Heaven for protection, stating that he would rather die than commit dreadful crimes.">

    <node id="The atmosphere when the jack struck the hours on the clock was one of suspense and nervousness among the people in the church. They were waiting for a wedding to begin, and the repeated striking of the clock added to their anticipation. The women in particular were impressed by the solemnity of the strikes, and there was no giggling or light-hearted behavior as there had been earlier. The young sergeant, who was to be married, stood still and silent throughout the clock's striking, and his rigidity seemed to add to the tension in the air. Overall, the jack's striking of the hours created a sense of anticipation and solemnity in the church.&#10;&#10;The people reacted to the clock's striking with increased attention and focus. The sound of the clock was audible throughout the church, and many of the congregation watched as the jack emerged from its niche, struck the bell, and retreated again. This spectacle was visible to many, now that the door of the clock tower was open. Some of the younger members of the congregation turned to look at the clock as it struck the hours, and even the old almsmen in the church seemed to take notice of the time. The clock's striking created a sense of unity among the people in the church, as they all listened to the same sound and waited for the wedding to begin.&#10;&#10;In summary, the atmosphere when the jack struck the hours on the clock was one of solemnity and anticipation, and the people reacted to it with increased attention and focus.

But the soldier never moved.  There he stood,&#10;his face to the south-east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.&#10;&#10;The clock ticked on.  The women threw off their nervousness, and&#10;titters and giggling became more frequent.  Then came a dead silence.&#10;Every one was waiting for the end.  Some persons may have noticed how&#10;extraordinarily the striking of quarters seems to quicken the flight&#10;of time.  It was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with&#10;the minutes when the rattle began again, the puppet emerged, and the&#10;four quarters were struck fitfully as before.  One could almost be&#10;positive that there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature's&#10;face, and a mischievous delight in its twitchings.  Then followed the&#10;dull and remote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower&#10;above.  The women were impressed, and there was no giggle this time.&#10;&#10;The clergyman glided into the" />

At present,&#10;however, the door was open, and the egress of the jack, the blows on&#10;the bell, and the mannikin's retreat into the nook again, were&#10;visible to many, and audible throughout the church.&#10;&#10;The jack had struck half-past eleven.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where's the woman?&quot; whispered some of the spectators.&#10;&#10;The young sergeant stood still with the abnormal rigidity of the old&#10;pillars around.  He faced the south-east, and was as silent as he was&#10;still.&#10;&#10;The silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the minutes went on,&#10;and nobody else appeared, and not a soul moved.  The rattle of the&#10;quarter-jack again from its niche, its blows for three-quarters, its&#10;fussy retreat, were almost painfully abrupt, and caused many of the&#10;congregation to start palpably.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wonder where the woman is!&quot; a voice whispered again.&#10;&#10;There began now that slight shifting of feet, that artificial&#10;coughing among several, which betrays a nervous suspense.

Here for a moment he stood&#10;alone.&#10;&#10;The officiating curate, who had not yet doffed his surplice,&#10;perceived the new-comer, and followed him to the communion-space.  He&#10;whispered to the soldier, and then beckoned to the clerk, who in his&#10;turn whispered to an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and they&#10;also went up the chancel steps.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis a wedding!&quot; murmured some of the women, brightening.  &quot;Let's&#10;wait!&quot;&#10;&#10;The majority again sat down.&#10;&#10;There was a creaking of machinery behind, and some of the young ones&#10;turned their heads.  From the interior face of the west wall of the&#10;tower projected a little canopy with a quarter-jack and small bell&#10;beneath it, the automaton being driven by the same clock machinery&#10;that struck the large bell in the tower.  Between the tower and the&#10;church was a close screen, the door of which was kept shut during&#10;services, hiding this grotesque clockwork from sight.

I waited till a quarter to twelve, and found&#10;then that I was in All Souls'.  But I wasn't much frightened, for&#10;I thought it could be to-morrow as well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You fool, for so fooling me!  But say no more.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall it be to-morrow, Frank?&quot; she asked blankly.&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow!&quot; and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh.  &quot;I don't go through&#10;that experience again for some time, I warrant you!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But after all,&quot; she expostulated in a trembling voice, &quot;the mistake&#10;was not such a terrible thing!  Now, dear Frank, when shall it be?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, when?

    <node id=" heavy strokes in the tower&#10;above.  The women were impressed, and there was no giggle this time.&#10;&#10;The clergyman glided into the vestry, and the clerk vanished.  The&#10;sergeant had not yet turned; every woman in the church was waiting to&#10;see his face, and he appeared to know it.  At last he did turn, and&#10;stalked resolutely down the nave, braving them all, with a compressed&#10;lip.  Two bowed and toothless old almsmen then looked at each other&#10;and chuckled, innocently enough; but the sound had a strange weird&#10;effect in that place.&#10;&#10;Opposite to the church was a paved square, around which several&#10;overhanging wood buildings of old time cast a picturesque shade.  The&#10;young man on leaving the door went to cross the square, when, in the&#10;middle, he met a little woman.  The expression of her face, which had&#10;been one of intense anxiety, sank at the sight of his nearly to&#10;terror.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well?&quot; he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly looking at her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Frank--I made a mistake!--I thought that church" />

To have brought all this about her&#10;ears was terrible; but after a while the situation was not without&#10;a fearful joy.  The facility with which even the most timid women&#10;sometimes acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is amalgamated&#10;with a little triumph, is marvellous.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The farmer, Boldwood, discovers that Bathsheba, his love interest, is not at home when he calls on her. He realizes that, being an agriculturist herself, she is likely to be outdoors at this time of year. Upon arriving at the sheep-washing location, Boldwood finds Bathsheba there, surrounded by men and busy with farm work. This demonstrates her independence and capabilities as a farmer, which adds depth to her character beyond just being an object of his affection." />
    <node id=" when the farmer determined to be no longer&#10;repulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense.  He had by this&#10;time grown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less&#10;even when it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the&#10;situation.  On inquiring for her at her house they had told him she&#10;was at the sheep-washing, and he went off to seek her there.&#10;&#10;The sheep-washing pool was a perfectly circular basin of brickwork in&#10;the meadows, full of the clearest water.  To birds on the wing its&#10;glassy surface, reflecting the light sky, must have been visible for&#10;miles around as a glistening Cyclops' eye in a green face.  The grass&#10;about the margin at this season was a sight to remember long--in a&#10;minor sort of way.  Its activity in sucking the moisture from the&#10;rich damp sod was almost a process observable by the eye.  The&#10;outskirts of this level water-meadow were diversified by rounded and&#10;hollow pastures, where just now every flower that was not a buttercup&#10;was a daisy.  The river slid along noiseless" />
    <node id="athsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a&#10;trifler with the affections of men, and a censor's experience on&#10;seeing an actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling&#10;of surprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,&#10;and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be.&#10;&#10;She resolved never again, by look or by sign, to interrupt the steady&#10;flow of this man's life.  But a resolution to avoid an evil is&#10;seldom framed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance&#10;impossible.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE SHEEP-WASHING--THE OFFER&#10;&#10;&#10;Boldwood did eventually call upon her.  She was not at home.  &quot;Of&#10;course not,&quot; he murmured.  In contemplating Bathsheba as a woman, he&#10;had forgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist--that&#10;being as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as himself,&#10;her probable whereabouts was out-of-doors at this time of the year.&#10;This, and the other oversights Boldwood was guilty of, were natural&#10;to the mood, and still more" />

Then up comes Maryann;&#10;throws the loose locks into the middle of the fleece, rolls it up,&#10;and carries it into the background as three-and-a-half pounds of&#10;unadulterated warmth for the winter enjoyment of persons unknown and&#10;far away, who will, however, never experience the superlative comfort&#10;derivable from the wool as it here exists, new and pure--before&#10;the unctuousness of its nature whilst in a living state has dried,&#10;stiffened, and been washed out--rendering it just now as superior&#10;to anything WOOLLEN as cream is superior to milk-and-water.&#10;&#10;But heartless circumstance could not leave entire Gabriel's happiness&#10;of this morning.  The rams, old ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly&#10;undergone their stripping, and the men were proceeding with the&#10;shear-lings and hogs, when Oak's belief that she was going to stand&#10;pleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully&#10;interrupted by Farmer Boldwood's appearance in the extremest corner&#10;of the" />
    <node id="&quot;My life is a burden without you,&quot; he exclaimed, in a low voice.  &quot;I&#10;want you--I want you to let me say I love you again and again!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba answered nothing, and the horse upon her arm seemed so&#10;impressed that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what I have to&#10;tell!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was to ask why he&#10;thought that, till she remembered that, far from being a conceited&#10;assumption on Boldwood's part, it was but the natural conclusion of&#10;serious reflection based on deceptive premises of her own offering.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish I could say courteous flatteries to you,&quot; the farmer&#10;continued in an easier tone, &quot;and put my rugged feeling into a&#10;graceful shape: but I have neither power nor patience to learn such&#10;things.  I want you for my wife--so wildly that no other feeling can&#10;abide in me; but I should not have spoken out had I not been led to&#10;hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The valentine again!  O" />
    <node id=" don't care for is not a praiseworthy action.&#10;And even, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined towards him, you&#10;might have let him find it out in some way of true loving-kindness,&#10;and not by sending him a valentine's letter.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba laid down the shears.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot allow any man to--to criticise my private conduct!&quot; she&#10;exclaimed.  &quot;Nor will I for a minute.  So you'll please leave the&#10;farm at the end of the week!&quot;&#10;&#10;It may have been a peculiarity--at any rate it was a fact--that when&#10;Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip&#10;trembled: when by a refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one.&#10;Her nether lip quivered now.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, so I will,&quot; said Gabriel calmly.  He had been held to&#10;her by a beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking,&#10;rather than by a chain he could not break.  &quot;I should be even better&#10;pleased to go at once,&quot; he added.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go at once then" />
    <node id=" Laban answered to her signal.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is Oak staying?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Across the valley at Nest Cottage!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jump on the bay mare, and ride across, and say he must return&#10;instantly--that I say so.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tall scrambled off to the field, and in two minutes was on Poll,&#10;the bay, bare-backed, and with only a halter by way of rein.  He&#10;diminished down the hill.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba watched.  So did all the rest.  Tall cantered along the&#10;bridle-path through Sixteen Acres, Sheeplands, Middle Field, The&#10;Flats, Cappel's Piece, shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge,&#10;and ascended from the valley through Springmead and Whitepits on the&#10;other side.  The cottage to which Gabriel had retired before taking&#10;his final departure from the locality was visible as a white spot on&#10;the opposite hill, backed by blue firs.  Bathsheba walked up and&#10;down.  The men entered the field and endeavoured to ease the anguish&#10;of the dumb creatures by rubbing them.  Nothing availed.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Bathsheba's behavior is influenced by several factors that cause her to blush and attract the attention of both Gabriel Oak and Farmer Boldwood. First, she is aware that the men find her and Boldwood's relationship noteworthy, as they have been overheard in conversation about it. This leads her to feel self-conscious about their interactions. &#10;&#10;Furthermore, Bathsheba becomes more conscious of Boldwood's attention and begins to subtly match his tone, a natural reaction for a young woman around a man she finds appealing. However, this behavior can be misconstrued as coquettishness by an outside observer like Gabriel Oak, who is already wary of Boldwood's intentions due to his previous declaration of love for Bathsheba. &#10;&#10;Lastly, the arrival of Pennyways, the dismissed bailiff, further contributes to the tension in the barn, causing Bathsheba to blush and making the atmosphere more charged. These factors combined lead Gabriel Oak to suspect that Bathsheba's behavior is indicative of coquettishness directed towards Boldwood." />
    <node id=" inexpressible close, there arose that buzz of&#10;pleasure which is the attar of applause.&#10;&#10;It is scarcely necessary to state that Gabriel could not avoid noting&#10;the farmer's bearing to-night towards their entertainer.  Yet there&#10;was nothing exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to&#10;his time of performing them.  It was when the rest were all looking&#10;away that Boldwood observed her; when they regarded her he turned&#10;aside; when they thanked or praised he was silent; when they&#10;were inattentive he murmured his thanks.  The meaning lay in the&#10;difference between actions, none of which had any meaning of itself;&#10;and the necessity of being jealous, which lovers are troubled with,&#10;did not lead Oak to underestimate these signs.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew from the window, and&#10;retired to the back part of the room, Boldwood thereupon closing the&#10;sash and the shutters, and remaining inside with her.  Oak wandered&#10;away under the quiet and scented trees.  Recovering from the softer&#10;impressions produced by Bathsheba's voice, the shearers rose to&#10;leave, C" />
    <node id=", and the&#10;grinding went on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Did the men think it odd?&quot; she said again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Odd was not the idea, miss.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What did they say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That Farmer Boldwood's name and your own were likely to be flung&#10;over pulpit together before the year was out.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought so by the look of them!  Why, there's nothing in it.  A&#10;more foolish remark was never made, and I want you to contradict it!&#10;that's what I came for.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel looked incredulous and sad, but between his moments of&#10;incredulity, relieved.&#10;&#10;&quot;They must have heard our conversation,&quot; she continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then, Bathsheba!&quot; said Oak, stopping the handle, and gazing&#10;into her face with astonishment.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Everdene, you mean,&quot; she said, with dignity.&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of marriage, I bain't&#10;going to tell a story and say he didn't to please you.  I have&#10;already tried to please you too much for my own good!&quot;&#10;&#10;B" />
    <node id=".  Then she reappeared in her new riding-habit of&#10;myrtle green, which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit;&#10;and young Bob Coggan led on her mare, Boldwood fetching his own horse&#10;from the tree under which it had been tied.&#10;&#10;Oak's eyes could not forsake them; and in endeavouring to continue&#10;his shearing at the same time that he watched Boldwood's manner,&#10;he snipped the sheep in the groin.  The animal plunged; Bathsheba&#10;instantly gazed towards it, and saw the blood.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Gabriel!&quot; she exclaimed, with severe remonstrance, &quot;you who are&#10;so strict with the other men--see what you are doing yourself!&quot;&#10;&#10;To an outsider there was not much to complain of in this remark; but&#10;to Oak, who knew Bathsheba to be well aware that she herself was the&#10;cause of the poor ewe's wound, because she had wounded the ewe's&#10;shearer in a still more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding&#10;sense of his inferiority to both herself and Boldwood was not&#10;calculated to heal.

She&#10;seemed to expect assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table&#10;was at her request left vacant until after they had begun the meal.&#10;She then asked Gabriel to take the place and the duties appertaining&#10;to that end, which he did with great readiness.&#10;&#10;At this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate, and crossed the&#10;green to Bathsheba at the window.  He apologized for his lateness:&#10;his arrival was evidently by arrangement.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gabriel,&quot; said she, &quot;will you move again, please, and let Mr.&#10;Boldwood come there?&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak moved in silence back to his original seat.&#10;&#10;The gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style, in a new coat&#10;and white waistcoat, quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of&#10;grey.  Inwardy, too, he was blithe, and consequently chatty to an&#10;exceptional degree.  So also was Bathsheba now that he had come,&#10;though the uninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff who had been&#10;dismissed for theft, disturbed her equanim" />
    <node id=" going to stand&#10;pleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully&#10;interrupted by Farmer Boldwood's appearance in the extremest corner&#10;of the barn.  Nobody seemed to have perceived his entry, but there he&#10;certainly was.  Boldwood always carried with him a social atmosphere&#10;of his own, which everybody felt who came near him; and the talk,&#10;which Bathsheba's presence had somewhat suppressed, was now totally&#10;suspended.&#10;&#10;He crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to greet him with a&#10;carriage of perfect ease.  He spoke to her in low tones, and she&#10;instinctively modulated her own to the same pitch, and her voice&#10;ultimately even caught the inflection of his.  She was far from&#10;having a wish to appear mysteriously connected with him; but woman at&#10;the impressionable age gravitates to the larger body not only in her&#10;choice of words, which is apparent every day, but even in her shades&#10;of tone and humour, when the influence is great.&#10;&#10;What they conversed about was not audible to Gabriel, who was too&#10;independent to get near, though too concerned to disregard.  The&#10;issue of their dialogue was" />
    <node id="1. The old barn has retained its original purpose, which is to provide storage for crops, unlike most modern churches or medieval castles that have been repurposed or no longer serve their original functions.&#10;2. The barn's design and features remain unaltered, reflecting the enduring nature of its intended use. This contrasts with many religious buildings and castles where alterations over time may have obscured their original forms and purposes.&#10;3. There is a sense of functional continuity in the barn, giving those who behold it a feeling of satisfaction, gratitude, and even pride in its permanence and the idea that has sustained it for four centuries.&#10;4. The barn's features, such as lanceolate windows, time-eaten archstones, and chamfers, along with its orientation and rafters, do not allude to an exploded fortifying art or worn-out religious creed. Instead, they symbolize the defense and salvation of the body through daily bread, which remains a relevant concept even today.&#10;&#10;In summary, the old barn stands as a testament to functional continuity and the enduring nature of its original purpose, giving those who see it a sense of satisfaction, gratitude, and pride in its permanence and the idea that has sustained it for four centuries." />

Along each side wall was a range of striding&#10;buttresses, throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them, which&#10;were perforated by lancet openings, combining in their proportions&#10;the precise requirements both of beauty and ventilation.&#10;&#10;One could say about this barn, what could hardly be said of either&#10;the church or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the&#10;purpose which had dictated its original erection was the same with&#10;that to which it was still applied.  Unlike and superior to either&#10;of those two typical remnants of mediaevalism, the old barn embodied&#10;practices which had suffered no mutilation at the hands of time.&#10;Here at least the spirit of the ancient builders was at one with&#10;the spirit of the modern beholder.  Standing before this abraded&#10;pile, the eye regarded its present usage, the mind dwelt upon its&#10;past history, with a satisfied sense of functional continuity&#10;throughout--a feeling almost of gratitude, and quite of pride, at the&#10;permanence of the idea which had heaped it up.

The fact that four&#10;centuries had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake, inspired&#10;any hatred of its purpose, nor given rise to any reaction that had&#10;battered it down, invested this simple grey effort of old minds with&#10;a repose, if not a grandeur, which a too curious reflection was apt&#10;to disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers.  For once&#10;mediaevalism and modernism had a common stand-point.  The lanceolate&#10;windows, the time-eaten archstones and chamfers, the orientation of&#10;the axis, the misty chestnut work of the rafters, referred to no&#10;exploded fortifying art or worn-out religious creed.  The defence and&#10;salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study, a religion,&#10;and a desire.&#10;&#10;To-day the large side doors were thrown open towards the sun to admit&#10;a bountiful light to the immediate spot of the shearers' operations,&#10;which was the wood threshing-floor in the centre, formed of thick&#10;oak" />

It not only emulated the form of the neighbouring church&#10;of the parish, but vied with it in antiquity.  Whether the barn had&#10;ever formed one of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to&#10;be aware; no trace of such surroundings remained.  The vast porches&#10;at the sides, lofty enough to admit a waggon laden to its highest&#10;with corn in the sheaf, were spanned by heavy-pointed arches of&#10;stone, broadly and boldly cut, whose very simplicity was the origin&#10;of a grandeur not apparent in erections where more ornament has been&#10;attempted.  The dusky, filmed, chestnut roof, braced and tied in&#10;by huge collars, curves, and diagonals, was far nobler in design,&#10;because more wealthy in material, than nine-tenths of those in our&#10;modern churches.

Five decades hardly modified the cut of a&#10;gaiter, the embroidery of a smock-frock, by the breadth of a hair.&#10;Ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase.  In&#10;these Wessex nooks the busy outsider's ancient times are only old;&#10;his old times are still new; his present is futurity.&#10;&#10;So the barn was natural to the shearers, and the shearers were in&#10;harmony with the barn.&#10;&#10;The spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesiastically to nave&#10;and chancel extremities, were fenced off with hurdles, the sheep&#10;being all collected in a crowd within these two enclosures; and in&#10;one angle a catching-pen was formed, in which three or four sheep&#10;were continuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without loss&#10;of time.

Here the shearers&#10;knelt, the sun slanting in upon their bleached shirts, tanned arms,&#10;and the polished shears they flourished, causing these to bristle&#10;with a thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak-eyed man.  Beneath&#10;them a captive sheep lay panting, quickening its pants as misgiving&#10;merged in terror, till it quivered like the hot landscape outside.&#10;&#10;This picture of to-day in its frame of four hundred years ago did&#10;not produce that marked contrast between ancient and modern which&#10;is implied by the contrast of date.  In comparison with cities,&#10;Weatherbury was immutable.  The citizen's THEN is the rustic's&#10;NOW.

    <node id="Gabriel's use of the trocar was very effective in saving the sheep. He successfully performed the operation on 49 out of the 57 injured sheep, which means that he had a success rate of approximately 86%. The procedure involved puncturing the skin and rumen of the sheep with the lance, allowing a current of air to rush up the tube and relieve the pressure in their stomachs. This relieved the symptoms of bloating and discomfort that the sheep were experiencing. Unfortunately, Gabriel did accidentally kill one sheep and four others died from their injuries without undergoing the operation.

Passing his&#10;hand over the sheep's left flank, and selecting the proper point, he&#10;punctured the skin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube;&#10;then he suddenly withdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its place.&#10;A current of air rushed up the tube, forcible enough to have&#10;extinguished a candle held at the orifice.&#10;&#10;It has been said that mere ease after torment is delight for a time;&#10;and the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now.&#10;Forty-nine operations were successfully performed.  Owing to the&#10;great hurry necessitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock,&#10;Gabriel missed his aim in one case, and in one only--striking wide&#10;of the mark, and inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering&#10;ewe.

The total&#10;number of sheep which had thus strayed and injured themselves so&#10;dangerously was fifty-seven.&#10;&#10;When the love-led man had ceased from his labours, Bathsheba came and&#10;looked him in the face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gabriel, will you stay on with me?&quot; she said, smiling winningly,&#10;and not troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end,&#10;because there was going to be another smile soon.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;And she smiled on him again.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE GREAT BARN AND THE SHEEP-SHEARERS&#10;&#10;&#10;Men thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as often by not&#10;making the most of good spirits when they have them as by lacking&#10;good spirits when they are indispensable.  Gabriel lately, for the&#10;first time since his prostration by misfortune, had been independent&#10;in thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent--conditions&#10;which, powerless without an opportunity as an opportunity without&#10;them is barren, would have given him a sure lift" />

A mounted&#10;figure passed between her and the sky, and drew on towards the field&#10;of sheep, the rider turning his face in receding.  Gabriel looked at&#10;her.  It was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell distinctly&#10;opposite tales. Bathsheba looked full of gratitude, and she said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!&quot;&#10;&#10;Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the&#10;one speech in the language that he could pardon for not being&#10;commendation of his readiness now.&#10;&#10;Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened on.  She knew from&#10;the look which sentence in her note had brought him.  Bathsheba&#10;followed to the field.&#10;&#10;Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.

It has been observed more than once that the causes of love&#10;are chiefly subjective, and Boldwood was a living testimony to the&#10;truth of the proposition.  No mother existed to absorb his devotion,&#10;no sister for his tenderness, no idle ties for sense.  He became&#10;surcharged with the compound, which was genuine lover's love.&#10;&#10;He approached the gate of the meadow.  Beyond it the ground was&#10;melodious with ripples, and the sky with larks; the low bleating of&#10;the flock mingling with both.  Mistress and man were engaged in the&#10;operation of making a lamb &quot;take,&quot; which is performed whenever an ewe&#10;has lost her own offspring, one of the twins of another ewe being&#10;given her as a substitute.  Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb, and&#10;was tying the skin over the body of the live lamb, in the customary&#10;manner, whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four&#10;hurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb were driven, where&#10;they would remain till the old sheep conceived an affection for" />

In the background, mellowed by tawny shade, were the three&#10;women, Maryann Money, and Temperance and Soberness Miller, gathering&#10;up the fleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying&#10;them round.  They were indifferently well assisted by the old&#10;maltster, who, when the malting season from October to April had&#10;passed, made himself useful upon any of the bordering farmsteads.&#10;&#10;Behind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the men to see that&#10;there was no cutting or wounding through carelessness, and that the&#10;animals were shorn close.  Gabriel, who flitted and hovered under her&#10;bright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously, half his time&#10;being spent in attending to the others and selecting the sheep for&#10;them.  At the present moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of&#10;mild liquor, supplied from a barrel in the corner, and cut pieces of&#10;bread and cheese.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution there, and&#10;lecturing one of the younger operators who had" />

I never knew a flock pass a year without getting&#10;into some scrape or other.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There's only one way of saving them,&quot; said Tall.&#10;&#10;&quot;What way?  Tell me quick!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They must be pierced in the side with a thing made on purpose.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you do it?  Can I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, ma'am.  We can't, nor you neither.  It must be done in a&#10;particular spot.  If ye go to the right or left but an inch you stab&#10;the ewe and kill her.

    <node id="Gabriel Oak's reaction to Bathsheba Everdene's request for him to deny the false rumors of her impending marriage to Farmer Boldwood is due to a combination of factors. First, he feels a sense of incredulity and sadness because he had tried to please her too much in the past, and he believes she is now trifling with both him and Boldwood.&#10;&#10;Second, Oak has been influenced by the overheard conversation between the men, who suggested that Bathsheba and Boldwood's names would be linked together before the year's end. This makes him more susceptible to interpreting Bathsheba's behavior as coquettishness, even though she is merely being friendly and attentive towards Boldwood.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Oak has become more introspective and self-conscious due to his unrequited love for Bathsheba. He perceives her actions through the lens of jealousy, noting every subtle difference in Boldwood's behavior when others are or aren't looking. As a result, Oak overinterprets these signs, believing that there is more meaning behind them than there actually is.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak's reaction to Bathsheba Everdene's request for him to deny false rumors of her impending marriage is influenced by his own insecurities and misunderstandings about her behavior towards Boldwood, rather than any deliberate actions on her part." />
    <node id=" the men, and dispersed among the green shadows&#10;behind.  Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now&#10;again distinct between their eyes and the light, which revealed that&#10;Boldwood had gone inside the room, and was sitting near her.&#10;&#10;Next came the question of the evening.  Would Miss Everdene sing to&#10;them the song she always sang so charmingly--&quot;The Banks of Allan&#10;Water&quot;--before they went home?&#10;&#10;After a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented, beckoning to&#10;Gabriel, who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you brought your flute?&quot; she whispered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, miss.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Play to my singing, then.&quot;&#10;&#10;She stood up in the window-opening, facing the men, the candles&#10;behind her, Gabriel on her right hand, immediately outside the&#10;sash-frame.  Boldwood had drawn up on her left, within the room.&#10;Her singing was soft and rather tremulous at first, but it soon&#10;swelled to a steady clearness.  Subsequent events caused one of the&#10;verses to be remembered for many months, and even years, by more" />
    <node id="oggan furnished a suitable reply.  Oak went on with his shearing,&#10;and said not another word.  Pestilent moods had come, and teased&#10;away his quiet.  Bathsheba had shown indications of anointing him&#10;above his fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm&#10;imperatively required.  He did not covet the post relatively to the&#10;farm: in relation to herself, as beloved by him and unmarried to&#10;another, he had coveted it.  His readings of her seemed now to be&#10;vapoury and indistinct.  His lecture to her was, he thought, one of&#10;the absurdest mistakes.  Far from coquetting with Boldwood, she had&#10;trifled with himself in thus feigning that she had trifled with&#10;another.  He was inwardly convinced that, in accordance with the&#10;anticipations of his easy-going and worse-educated comrades, that day&#10;would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss Everdene.  Gabriel&#10;at this time of his life had out-grown the instinctive dislike which&#10;every Christian boy has for reading the Bible, perusing it now&#10;quite frequently, and he inwardly said" />
    <node id="Bathsheba closely observes Gabriel as he skillfully shears a ewe, demonstrating her interest in the farm work and her role as a farmer. She is not afraid to correct him when he makes a mistake, showing her authority and confidence. However, she is also aware of the impact of her presence on Gabriel and subtly matches his tone, which may be misconstrued as coquettishness by others. Overall, Bathsheba's interaction with Gabriel highlights her independence, capability, and attention to detail in managing the farm, while also indicating her complex relationship with Gabriel and Boldwood." />
    <node id="bread and cheese.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution there, and&#10;lecturing one of the younger operators who had allowed his last&#10;finished sheep to go off among the flock without re-stamping it with&#10;her initials, came again to Gabriel, as he put down the luncheon to&#10;drag a frightened ewe to his shear-station, flinging it over upon its&#10;back with a dexterous twist of the arm.  He lopped off the tresses&#10;about its head, and opened up the neck and collar, his mistress&#10;quietly looking on.&#10;&#10;&quot;She blushes at the insult,&quot; murmured Bathsheba, watching the pink&#10;flush which arose and overspread the neck and shoulders of the ewe&#10;where they were left bare by the clicking shears--a flush which was&#10;enviable, for its delicacy, by many queens of coteries, and would&#10;have been creditable, for its promptness, to any woman in the world.&#10;&#10;Poor Gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content by having her&#10;over him, her eyes critically regarding his skilful shears, which&#10;apparently were going to gather up a" />
    <node id=" a luxury of content by having her&#10;over him, her eyes critically regarding his skilful shears, which&#10;apparently were going to gather up a piece of the flesh at every&#10;close, and yet never did so.  Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in&#10;that he was not over happy.  He had no wish to converse with her:&#10;that his bright lady and himself formed one group, exclusively their&#10;own, and containing no others in the world, was enough.&#10;&#10;So the chatter was all on her side.  There is a loquacity that tells&#10;nothing, which was Bathsheba's; and there is a silence which says&#10;much: that was Gabriel's.  Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he&#10;went on to fling the ewe over upon her other side, covering her head&#10;with his knee, gradually running the shears line after line round her&#10;dewlap; thence about her flank and back, and finishing over the tail.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well done, and done quickly!&quot; said Bathsheba, looking at her watch&#10;as the last snip resounded.&#10;&#10;&quot;How long, miss?&quot; said Gabriel, wiping his brow.&#10;&#10;" />

The strait she was&#10;in through pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer: she&#10;burst out crying bitterly; they all saw it; and she attempted no&#10;further concealment.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wouldn't cry about it, miss,&quot; said William Smallbury,&#10;compassion" />

I cannot bear you to feel so much, and me to&#10;feel nothing.  And I am afraid they will notice us, Mr. Boldwood.&#10;Will you let the matter rest now?  I cannot think collectedly.

    <node id="Bathsheba decided to let Gabriel leave the farm immediately after refusing to tolerate any criticism of her private conduct due to her emotional response to his words. When she is swayed by an earthly emotion, her lower lip trembles, and in this case, she was likely feeling embarrassed and defensive about her actions with Boldwood. Her reaction suggests that she is not used to having her decisions questioned, further highlighting her independent and capable nature as a farmer. By asking Gabriel to leave, she asserts her authority and reestablishes her personal boundaries, despite any pain it may cause her. The text also suggests that she may feel guilty about leading Boldwood on, which could have influenced her decision to let Gabriel go rather than keeping him on as a farmhand." />
    <node id=" conversed about was not audible to Gabriel, who was too&#10;independent to get near, though too concerned to disregard.  The&#10;issue of their dialogue was the taking of her hand by the courteous&#10;farmer to help her over the spreading-board into the bright June&#10;sunlight outside.  Standing beside the sheep already shorn, they went&#10;on talking again.  Concerning the flock?  Apparently not. Gabriel&#10;theorized, not without truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter&#10;within reach of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon&#10;it.  Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying upon the&#10;ground, in a way which suggested less ovine criticism than womanly&#10;embarrassment.  She became more or less red in the cheek, the blood&#10;wavering in uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space&#10;between ebb and flood.  Gabriel sheared on, constrained and sad.&#10;&#10;She left Boldwood's side, and he walked up and down alone for nearly&#10;a quarter of an hour.  Then she reappeared in her new riding-habit of&#10;myrtle green, which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its" />
    <node id="The subjective cause of Boldwood's love is his lack of close relationships that could absorb his devotion, tenderness, and emotion. He has no mother, sister, or idle ties to occupy these feelings, causing him to become &quot;surcharged with the compound&quot; of genuine lover's love. This is illustrated by his actions towards the lamb 'take' operation in the meadow.&#10;&#10;In this scene, Boldwood watches Bathsheba and Gabriel from afar while they are working on making a lamb &quot;take.&quot; The process involves replacing a ewe's lost offspring with another lamb to foster. By observing their interaction and participating in this task, Boldwood symbolically longs for a similar connection with Bathsheba - he wishes to be the one she chooses as her substitute, just as the live lamb is chosen by the ewe. This subconscious desire further highlights his strong feelings of love for Bathsheba, which are fueled by the absence of other emotional outlets in his life." />
    <node id="A.'s.  Boldwood was&#10;satisfied now.&#10;&#10;And this charming woman had in effect said to him, &quot;Marry me.&quot;  Why&#10;should she have done that strange thing?  Boldwood's blindness to&#10;the difference between approving of what circumstances suggest, and&#10;originating what they do not suggest, was well matched by Bathsheba's&#10;insensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings.&#10;&#10;She was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer,&#10;adding up accounts with him as indifferently as if his face had been&#10;the pages of a ledger.  It was evident that such a nature as his had&#10;no attraction for a woman of Bathsheba's taste.  But Boldwood grew&#10;hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy; he trod for the&#10;first time the threshold of &quot;the injured lover's hell.&quot;  His first&#10;impulse was to go and thrust himself between them.  This could be&#10;done, but only in one way--by asking to see a sample of her corn.&#10;Boldwood renounced the idea.  He could not make the request; it was&#10;debasing loveliness to ask it to buy" />

Gabriel, to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an&#10;April day, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and instantly&#10;discerned thereon the mark of some influence from without, in the&#10;form of a keenly self-conscious reddening.  He also turned and beheld&#10;Boldwood.&#10;&#10;At once connecting these signs with the letter Boldwood had shown&#10;him, Gabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that&#10;means, and carried on since, he knew not how.&#10;&#10;Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware&#10;of his presence, and the perception was as too much light turned upon&#10;his new sensibility.  He was still in the road, and by moving on he&#10;hoped that neither would recognize that he had originally intended" />

But a manly resolve to recognize boldly that he&#10;had no longer a lover's interest in her, helped him occasionally to&#10;conceal a feeling.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bottle!&quot; he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.  Cainy Ball ran&#10;up, the wound was anointed, and the shearing continued.&#10;&#10;Boldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle, and before they&#10;turned away she again spoke out to Oak with the same dominative and&#10;tantalizing graciousness.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am going now to see Mr. Boldwood's Leicesters.  Take my place in&#10;the barn, Gabriel, and keep the men carefully to their work.&quot;&#10;&#10;The horses' heads were put about, and they trotted away.&#10;&#10;Boldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great interest among all&#10;around him; but, after having been pointed out for so many years&#10;as the perfect exemplar of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an&#10;anticlimax somewhat resembling that of St. John Long's death by" />

Being a man who read all the dramas of life&#10;seriously, if he failed to please when they were comedies, there was&#10;no frivolous treatment to reproach him for when they chanced to end&#10;tragically.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon&#10;which she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic&#10;intensity.  Had she known Boldwood's moods, her blame would have&#10;been fearful, and the stain upon her heart ineradicable.  Moreover,&#10;had she known her present power for good or evil over this man, she&#10;would have trembled at her responsibility.  Luckily for her present,&#10;unluckily for her future tranquillity, her understanding had not yet&#10;told her what Boldwood was.  Nobody knew entirely; for though it was&#10;possible to form guesses concerning his wild capabilities from old&#10;floodmarks faintly visible, he had never been seen at the high tides&#10;which caused them.&#10;&#10;Farmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked forth across the&#10;level fields.

    <node id="Casterbridge's farmer Boldwood has an intense reaction when he encounters Bathsheba in the market place due to several factors. First, this is the first time he truly looks at her and notices her as a woman, rather than a remote phenomenon. Second, their encounter is not by chance; Bathsheba realizes that she is the reason for his appearance there. This realization makes Boldwood feel self-conscious about his feelings towards her and ignites an &quot;incipient jealousy&quot; within him when he sees her interacting with another man. Despite the seemingly minor cause of this encounter, it has a tremendous effect on Boldwood as it marks a turning point in his unrequited love for Bathsheba and triggers his shift from being an observer to becoming an active participant in pursuing her affections." />

The&#10;farmer took courage, and for the first time really looked at her.&#10;&#10;Material causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in&#10;regular equation.  The result from capital employed in the production&#10;of any movement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the&#10;cause itself is absurdly minute.  When women are in a freakish mood,&#10;their usual intuition, either from carelessness or inherent defect,&#10;seemingly fails to teach them this, and hence it was that Bathsheba&#10;was fated to be astonished to-day.&#10;&#10;Boldwood looked at her--not slily, critically, or understandingly,&#10;but blankly at gaze, in the way a reaper looks up at a passing&#10;train--as something foreign to his element, and but dimly understood.&#10;To Boldwood women had been remote phenomena rather than" />

He passed by with an utter and overwhelming&#10;sensation of ignorance, shyness, and doubt.  Perhaps in her manner&#10;there were signs that she wished to see him--perhaps not--he could&#10;not read a woman.  The cabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to&#10;consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in misleading ways.  Every&#10;turn, look, word, and accent contained a mystery quite distinct from&#10;its obvious import, and not one had ever been pondered by him until&#10;now.&#10;&#10;As for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the belief that Farmer&#10;Boldwood had walked by on business or in idleness.  She collected&#10;the probabilities of the case, and concluded that she was herself&#10;responsible for Boldwood's appearance there.  It troubled her much&#10;to see what a great flame a little wildfire was likely to kindle.&#10;Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a&#10;trifler with the affections of men, and a censor's experience on" />

It is the first time that I have ever seen one&#10;done in less than half an hour.&quot;&#10;&#10;The clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece--how perfectly&#10;like Aphrodite rising from the foam should have been seen to be&#10;realized--looking startled and shy at the loss of its garment, which&#10;lay on the floor in one soft cloud, united throughout, the portion&#10;visible being the inner surface only, which, never before exposed,&#10;was white as snow, and without flaw or blemish of the minutest kind.&#10;&#10;&quot;Cain Ball!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Mister Oak; here I be!&quot;&#10;&#10;Cainy now runs forward with the tar-pot.  &quot;B.

    <node id="ain departed, and Bathsheba took the handle.  Gabriel had glanced up&#10;in intense surprise, quelled its expression, and looked down again.&#10;Bathsheba turned the winch, and Gabriel applied the shears.&#10;&#10;The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful&#10;tendency to benumb the mind.  It is a sort of attenuated variety of&#10;Ixion's punishment, and contributes a dismal chapter to the history&#10;of gaols.  The brain gets muddled, the head grows heavy, and the&#10;body's centre of gravity seems to settle by degrees in a leaden lump&#10;somewhere between the eyebrows and the crown.  Bathsheba felt the&#10;unpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen turns.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?&quot; she said.  &quot;My&#10;head is in a whirl, and I can't talk.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel turned.  Bathsheba then began, with some awkwardness,&#10;allowing her thoughts to stray occasionally from her story to attend&#10;to the shears, which required a little nicety in sharpening.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wanted to ask you if the men made any" />
    <node id=" a chain he could not break.  &quot;I should be even better&#10;pleased to go at once,&quot; he added.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go at once then, in Heaven's name!&quot; said she, her eyes flashing at&#10;his, though never meeting them.  &quot;Don't let me see your face any&#10;more.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, Miss Everdene--so it shall be.&quot;&#10;&#10;And he took his shears and went away from her in placid dignity, as&#10;Moses left the presence of Pharaoh.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TROUBLES IN THE FOLD--A MESSAGE&#10;&#10;&#10;Gabriel Oak had ceased to feed the Weatherbury flock for about&#10;four-and-twenty hours, when on Sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen&#10;Joseph Poorgrass, Matthew Moon, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came&#10;running up to the house of the mistress of the Upper Farm.&#10;&#10;&quot;Whatever IS the matter, men?&quot; she said, meeting them at the door&#10;just as she was coming out on her way to church, and ceasing in a&#10;moment from the close compression of her two red lips, with which&#10;she had accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight" />
    <node id=" story to attend&#10;to the shears, which required a little nicety in sharpening.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wanted to ask you if the men made any observations on my going&#10;behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood yesterday?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, they did,&quot; said Gabriel.  &quot;You don't hold the shears right,&#10;miss--I knew you wouldn't know the way--hold like this.&quot;&#10;&#10;He relinquished the winch, and inclosing her two hands completely in&#10;his own (taking each as we sometimes slap a child's hand in teaching&#10;him to write), grasped the shears with her.  &quot;Incline the edge so,&quot;&#10;he said.&#10;&#10;Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words, and held thus for a&#10;peculiarly long time by the instructor as he spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;That will do,&quot; exclaimed Bathsheba.  &quot;Loose my hands.  I won't have&#10;them held!  Turn the winch.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel freed her hands quietly, retired to his handle, and the&#10;grinding went on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Did the men think it odd?&quot; she said again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Odd was not the idea" />
    <node id="Bathsheba's question about Gabriel staying on with her has a significant impact on his independence in thought and vigorous action. By asking him to stay, she unknowingly validates his worth and capabilities as a farmer, which helps restore his self-esteem after facing recent hardships. This affirmation encourages Gabriel to maintain his independent spirit while also fostering loyalty towards Bathsheba for giving him this opportunity.&#10;&#10;The impact of this decision could be substantial for Gabriel's future opportunities. By remaining on the farm, he continues to gain valuable experience in managing a farm and working with sheep, which can lead to better prospects in the future. Furthermore, his loyalty towards Bathsheba might open up new chances for advancement within her farm or even inspire him to start his own venture eventually.&#10;&#10;However, it is essential to note that while staying on at the farm reinforces Gabriel's independence in thought and action, it also keeps him tied to unrequited love for Bathsheba. This emotional connection may hinder his ability to move forward in other aspects of his life, such as finding romantic companionship or pursuing different career paths. Nonetheless, the overall benefit of having stability and purpose through farm work will likely outweigh these potential drawbacks for Gabriel." />
    <node id="The significant event taking place between Bathsheba Everdene and Boldwood in the parlor is Bathsheba singing &quot;The Banks of Allan Water&quot; with Gabriel Oak playing the flute, as observed by Pennyways. This event is significant because it creates a romantic atmosphere that may further fuel Boldwood's feelings for Bathsheba, and it also highlights Bathsheba's charm and her influence over the men around her. The scene is imbued with tension due to the recent conversation about their relationship and Pennyways' arrival, making Gabriel suspicious of Bathsheba's behavior towards Boldwood." />
    <node id="&#10;clothes dribbling forth a small rill.&#10;&#10;Boldwood came close and bade her good morning, with such constraint&#10;that she could not but think he had stepped across to the washing for&#10;its own sake, hoping not to find her there; more, she fancied his&#10;brow severe and his eye slighting.  Bathsheba immediately contrived&#10;to withdraw, and glided along by the river till she was a stone's&#10;throw off.  She heard footsteps brushing the grass, and had a&#10;consciousness that love was encircling her like a perfume.  Instead&#10;of turning or waiting, Bathsheba went further among the high sedges,&#10;but Boldwood seemed determined, and pressed on till they were&#10;completely past the bend of the river. Here, without being seen,&#10;they could hear the splashing and shouts of the washers above.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Everdene!&quot; said the farmer.&#10;&#10;She trembled, turned, and said &quot;Good morning.&quot;  His tone was so&#10;utterly removed from all she had expected as a beginning.  It was&#10;lowness and quiet accentuated: an emphasis of deep meanings, their&#10;form, at the same time," />
    <node id="Based on Boldwood's behavior during the evening at Oak's shearing supper, it is evident that he has strong romantic feelings for Bathsheba. His fixation on her and his constant attendance to her needs demonstrate his deep admiration and infatuation. Moreover, his reluctance to leave her side and join in the general merriment of the party further highlight his single-minded focus on courting Bathsheba. However, Boldwood's lack of experience with romantic relationships and emotional expression may lead him to be overly formal and reserved in his interactions with Bathsheba, potentially making it difficult for her to fully grasp the depth of his feelings." />
    <node id="The shearers were shearing sheep in a barn, with candles lit in the back part of the room providing new flames that shone down the table and over the men. The time was twilight, which had expanded and enveloped them completely before they showed signs of moving. Farmer Boldwood had gone from his place at the bottom of the table; Gabriel Oak noticed his absence but did not know how long he had been gone. When Boldwood was absent, Bathsheba spoke to Oak with a dominative and tantalizing graciousness, asking him to take her place in the barn and keep the men carefully to their work." />
    <node id="&#10;shearers' lower parts becoming steeped in embrowning twilight, whilst&#10;their heads and shoulders were still enjoying day, touched with a&#10;yellow of self-sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than&#10;acquired.&#10;&#10;The sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they sat, and talked on,&#10;and grew as merry as the gods in Homer's heaven.  Bathsheba still&#10;remained enthroned inside the window, and occupied herself in&#10;knitting, from which she sometimes looked up to view the fading scene&#10;outside.  The slow twilight expanded and enveloped them completely&#10;before the signs of moving were shown.&#10;&#10;Gabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his place at the bottom&#10;of the table.  How long he had been gone Oak did not know; but he&#10;had apparently withdrawn into the encircling dusk.  Whilst he was&#10;thinking of this, Liddy brought candles into the back part of the&#10;room overlooking the shearers, and their lively new flames shone down&#10;the table and over the men, and dispersed among the green shadows&#10;behind.  Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now&#10;again distinct between their" />
    <node id="The woman, Bathsheba Everdene, feels a complex mix of emotions regarding her past actions and their consequences. She initially feels regret and guilt for her hasty decision to let Gabriel leave the farm, but there is also a sense of satisfaction and joy in asserting her authority and reestablishing her personal boundaries. The text suggests that she may take pleasure in the &quot;dreadful&quot; situation because it brings with it a &quot;little triumph,&quot; which highlights the surprising ease with which some women can find enjoyment in challenging circumstances.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's emotional reaction to Gabriel's words indicates that she is not used to having her decisions questioned, further emphasizing her independent and capable nature as a farmer. However, her guilt over leading Boldwood on may have influenced her decision to let Gabriel go rather than keeping him on as a farmhand.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's expectations of being reprimanded by Gabriel for her behavior towards Boldwood demonstrate that she is aware of the potential consequences of her actions. However, when Gabriel fails to chastise her and instead lectures her about leading Boldwood on, she feels frustrated and disappointed.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's feelings regarding her past actions and their consequences are nuanced and complex, reflecting her independent spirit, capable nature, and occasional impulsiveness." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Or wishing it either.&quot;&#10;&#10;A woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her,&#10;and with a rudeness which is not offensive.  Bathsheba would have&#10;submitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel&#10;protested that he was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity&#10;of passion unrequited is bearable, even if it stings and&#10;anathematizes--there is a triumph in the humiliation, and a&#10;tenderness in the strife.  This was what she had been expecting,&#10;and what she had not got.  To be lectured because the lecturer saw&#10;her in the cold morning light of open-shuttered disillusion was&#10;exasperating.  He had not finished, either.  He continued in a more&#10;agitated voice:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My opinion is (since you ask it) that you are greatly to blame for&#10;playing pranks upon a man like Mr. Boldwood, merely as a pastime.&#10;Leading on a man you don't care for is not a praiseworthy action.&#10;And even, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined towards him, you&#10;might have" />
    <node id="Gabriel's use of the trocar was very effective in saving the sheep, as he successfully performed the operation on 49 out of the 57 injured sheep, resulting in a success rate of approximately 86%. The procedure involved puncturing the skin and rumen of the sheep with the lance, allowing air to rush up the tube and relieve the pressure in their stomachs. This relieved the symptoms of bloating and discomfort that the sheep were experiencing.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, Gabriel accidentally killed one sheep and four others died from their injuries without undergoing the operation. However, overall, his actions saved the majority of the flock and prevented further loss." />
    <node id="The men observed Bathsheba's encounter with Mr. Boldwood behind the sedge and thought it was odd.

Don't be happier if happiness only comes from my&#10;agreeing.  Be neutral, Mr. Boldwood!  I must think.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will wait,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;And then she turned away.  Boldwood dropped his gaze to the ground,&#10;and stood long like a man who did not know where he was.  Realities&#10;then returned upon him like the pain of a wound received in an&#10;excitement which eclipses it, and he, too, then went on.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;PERPLEXITY--GRINDING THE SHEARS--A QUARREL&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I can desire,&quot;&#10;Bathsheba mused.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Bathsheba responds to Gabriel's criticism of her conduct with sarcasm, saying that she sees the praise of discerning people in his abuse. This indicates her frustration and disappointment with Gabriel's words, as she had expected him to reprimand her but instead received a lecture about leading Boldwood on. Bathsheba's emotional reaction to Gabriel's criticism also shows that she is not used to having her decisions questioned, highlighting her independent and capable nature as a farmer.&#10;&#10;When Gabriel acknowledges his rudeness and explains that he thought it would do good, Bathsheba replies sarcastically, implying that she holds him in low esteem. This further demonstrates her frustration and disappointment with Gabriel's words, as well as her independent spirit and occasional impulsiveness.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's response to Gabriel's criticism reflects her complex emotions regarding her past actions and their consequences, as well as her awareness of the potential consequences of her behavior towards Boldwood." />

    <node id="The topic of the confidential conversation between Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that they discussed their relationship or Bathsheba's feelings towards Boldwood. The text mentions that Bathsheba was concerned about how the men, including Boldwood, perceived her encounter with Mr. Boldwood behind the sedge. This concern might have been the focus of their conversation, with Bathsheba attempting to clear up any misunderstandings or easing his romantic feelings if necessary.&#10;&#10;The conversation affected Bathsheba's tone and mannerism during their exchange by making her more aware of the impact of her presence on Boldwood and others. To prevent any misinterpretation of coquettishness, she may have subtly matched Boldwood's tone in an attempt to maintain a professional demeanor while discussing sensitive matters." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the new date for Bathsheba and Frank's meeting is not explicitly determined in this text. However, it seems that Frank has decided to postpone their meeting to another day due to his annoyance with Bathsheba's mistake. He states, &quot;I don't go through that experience again for some time, I warrant you!&quot; This suggests that he will choose a different date for their next meeting, but the specific date is not provided in the text.&#10;&#10;Moreover, it is essential to note that Frank's reaction to Bathsheba's mistake might be influenced by his feelings of frustration or annoyance at that moment. His strong emotions could lead him to react more harshly than he might have otherwise, making it difficult for Bathsheba to propose a new date for their meeting immediately. Instead, the new date will likely be determined through further communication between Frank and Bathsheba at a later time." />
    <node id="Based on the supporting materials provided, Gabriel initially reacts to Bathsheba's close observation and correction with patience and acceptance, demonstrating his skill and confidence in his work. He is likely accustomed to working under the scrutiny of farmers and does not let Bathsheba's critical comments affect his focus or demeanor. Instead, he continues to shear the ewe competently and professionally, using the situation as an opportunity to showcase his expertise.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Gabriel subtlety matches Bathsheba's tone, which may indicate a level of comfort and familiarity between them, despite any potential tension or misunderstandings caused by her presence. Overall, Gabriel handles the situation with grace and competence, maintaining his quiet and skilled demeanor while working under Bathsheba's critical supervision." />
    <node id="The scene of shearing in Weatherbury stands in stark contrast to the rapid pace of change in cities such as London and Paris. Weatherbury is described as &quot;immutable,&quot; with changes taking place over the course of many generations, rather than within a few years or even months. The narrator notes that five decades hardly modify the cut of a gaiter or the embroidery of a smock-frock, and ten generations fail to alter the turn of a single phrase. This is in direct contrast to cities like London and Paris, where twenty or thirty years ago are considered &quot;old times&quot; and even ten years can bring about significant changes.&#10;&#10;The barn where the shearing takes place is described as being as ancient and venerable as the neighboring church, suggesting a deep-rooted connection to tradition and history. The spacious ends of the building, which answer &quot;ecclesiastically to nave and chancel extremities,&quot; further emphasize this connection.&#10;&#10;In contrast, cities like London and Paris are constantly changing, with new fashions and trends emerging all the time. The pace of life is much faster, and there is less emphasis on preserving traditional methods and practices.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene of shearing in Weatherbury serves as a reminder of the value of tradition and the importance of preserving ancient practices, even as the world around us changes at an increasingly rapid pace." />

The wind, which had been blowing east for several&#10;weeks, had veered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come&#10;abruptly--almost without a beginning.  It was that period in the&#10;vernal quarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the&#10;season.

When Tall returned with the horse, Bathsheba inquired about Gabriel's whereabouts, but Gabriel was not visible yet. The text does not provide a specific reason why Gabriel had not returned, but it could be due to the time it took for him to gather his belongings and leave Nest Cottage, which was across the valley from where Bathsheba was located. It is also possible that Gabriel intentionally delayed his return to avoid crossing paths with Tall or Boldwood, given the tension between them." />

She hoped Tall had had presence of mind&#10;enough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot.&#10;The rider neared them.  It was Tall.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, what folly!&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Gabriel was not visible anywhere.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps he is already gone!&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;Tall came into the inclosure, and leapt off, his face tragic as&#10;Morton's after the battle of Shrewsbury.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well?&quot; said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that her verbal&#10;_lettre-de-cachet_ could possibly have miscarried.&#10;&#10;&quot;He says BEGGARS MUSTN'T BE CHOOSERS,&quot; replied Laban.&#10;" />

They sat and talked, becoming as cheerful as the gods in Homer's heaven. Bathsheba remained enthroned inside the window, occupied with knitting and occasionally looking up to view the fading scene outside. As they all sat there, Gabriel Oak noticed Farmer Boldwood's absence from his place at the bottom of the table. The sun had gone down in an ochreous mist, but Liddy brought candles into the back part of the room, illuminating Bathsheba's form between the men and the light.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Mr. Boldwood arrived and joined Bathsheba at the window, prompting her to ask Gabriel Oak to move from his seat so that Mr. Boldwood could take it. After dinner, the men requested a song from Bathsheba, who then stood up in the window-opening with Gabriel playing his flute on her right and Boldwood sitting near her on the left. The scene depicted a lively and joyful atmosphere among the shearers, Bathsheba, and the three gentlemen: Oak, Boldwood, and Pennyways. Candlelight illuminated Bathsheba's figure as she sang with Gabriel accompanying her on his flute, creating an unforgettable moment for all those present." />

This was so&#10;successful that he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath,&#10;after a few false starts:--&#10;&#10;&#10;   I sow'-ed th'-e .....&#10;   I sow'-ed .....&#10;   I sow'-ed th'-e seeds' of' love',&#10;      I-it was' all' i'-in the'-e spring',&#10;   I-in A'-pril', Ma'-ay, a'-nd sun'-ny' June',&#10;      When sma'-all bi'-irds they' do' sing.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well put out of hand,&quot; said Coggan, at the end of the verse.  &quot;'They&#10;do sing' was a very taking paragraph.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay; and there was a pretty place at 'seeds of love.' and 'twas well&#10;heaved" />

Bob Coggan was sent&#10;home for his ill manners, and tranquility was restored by Jacob&#10;Smallbury, who volunteered a ballad as inclusive and interminable&#10;as that with which the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar&#10;occasion the swains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs of&#10;his day.&#10;&#10;It was still the beaming time of evening, though night was stealthily&#10;making itself visible low down upon the ground, the western lines of&#10;light raking the earth without alighting upon it to any extent, or&#10;illuminating the dead levels at all.  The sun had crept round the&#10;tree as a last effort before death, and then began to sink, the&#10;shearers' lower parts becoming steeped in embrowning twilight, whilst&#10;their heads and shoulders were still enjoying day, touched with a&#10;yellow of" />

    <node id="For the shearing-supper, a long table was set up on the grass-plot next to the house, with one end of the table extending over the sill of the wide parlour window and into the room. Miss Everdene, Bathsheba, sat inside the window, facing down the table and thus at the head without mingling with the men. This arrangement allowed her to oversee the event while maintaining a degree of separation from the workers.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba played an active role in the supper, engaging with the men and ensuring they were carefully attending to their work. She also showed concern for the well-being of the sheep being sheared. After the meal, Bathsheba agreed to sing &quot;The Banks of Allan Water&quot; for the shearers, accompanied by Gabriel Oak on his flute. This performance further solidified her role as the central figure of the evening and contributed to the overall camaraderie of the shearing supper." />

The narrator notes that five decades hardly modify the cut of a gaiter or the embroidery of a smock-frock, and ten generations fail to alter the turn of a single phrase. This is in direct contrast to cities like London and Paris, where twenty or thirty years ago are considered &quot;old times&quot; and even ten years can bring about significant changes.&#10;&#10;The barn where the shearing takes place is described as being as ancient and venerable as the neighboring church, suggesting a deep-rooted connection to tradition and history. The spacious ends of the building, which answer &quot;ecclesiastically to nave and chancel extremities,&quot; further emphasize this connection.&#10;&#10;In contrast, cities like London and Paris are constantly changing, with new fashions and trends emerging all the time. The pace of life is much faster, and there is less emphasis on preserving traditional methods and practices.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene of shearing in Weatherbury serves as a reminder of the value of tradition and the importance of preserving ancient practices, even as the world around us changes at an increasingly rapid pace.">

This affirmation encourages Gabriel to maintain his independent spirit while also fostering loyalty towards Bathsheba for giving him this opportunity.&#10;&#10;The impact of this decision could be substantial for Gabriel's future opportunities. By remaining on the farm, he continues to gain valuable experience in managing a farm and working with sheep, which can lead to better prospects in the future. Furthermore, his loyalty towards Bathsheba might open up new chances for advancement within her farm or even inspire him to start his own venture eventually.&#10;&#10;However, it is essential to note that while staying on at the farm reinforces Gabriel's independence in thought and action, it also keeps him tied to unrequited love for Bathsheba. This emotional connection may hinder his ability to move forward in other aspects of his life, such as finding romantic companionship or pursuing different career paths. Nonetheless, the overall benefit of having stability and purpose through farm work will likely outweigh these potential drawbacks for Gabriel.">

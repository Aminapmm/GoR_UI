    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer believes that Hetty's &quot;strange feeling&quot; that they will meet again is due to God encouraging her in her extremity. He interprets it as a sign of hope and comfort from the divine, particularly because they may be separated for an extended period or in a distant land." />
    <node id=" Let me speak to him; give me his hand; so; I feel&#10;it. Delaware, you will love and cherish this young Indian woman--I know&#10;how fond she is of you; you must be fond of her. Don't treat her as some&#10;of your people treat their wives; be a real husband to her. Now, bring&#10;Deerslayer near me; give me his hand.&quot;&#10;&#10;This request was complied with, and the hunter stood by the side of&#10;the pallet, submitting to the wishes of the girl with the docility of a&#10;child.&#10;&#10;&quot;I feel, Deerslayer,&quot; she resumed, &quot;though I couldn't tell why--but&#10;I feel that you and I are not going to part for ever. 'Tis a strange&#10;feeling! I never had it before; I wonder what it comes from!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis God encouraging you in extremity, Hetty; as such it ought to be&#10;harbored and respected. Yes, we shall meet ag'in, though it may be a&#10;long time first, and in a far distant land.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you mean to be buried in the lake, too? If so, that may account for" />
    <node id=" Still, Deerslayer, it is not easy for&#10;one of my sex and years to forget all her lessons of infancy, all&#10;her habits, and her natural diffidence, and say openly what her heart&#10;feels!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not, Judith? Why shouldn't women as well as men deal fairly and&#10;honestly by their fellow creatur's? I see no reason why you should not&#10;speak as plainly as myself, when there is any thing ra'ally important to&#10;be said.&quot;&#10;&#10;This indomitable diffidence, which still prevented the young man from&#10;suspecting the truth, would have completely discouraged the girl, had&#10;not her whole soul, as well as her whole heart, been set upon making a&#10;desperate effort to rescue herself from a future that she dreaded with&#10;a horror as vivid as the distinctness with which she fancied she foresaw&#10;it. This motive, however, raised her above all common considerations,&#10;and she persevered even to her own surprise, if not to her great&#10;confusion.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will--I must deal as plainly with you, as I would with poor, dear&#10;Hetty, were that sweet child living!&quot; she continued" />
    <node id=" time first, and in a far distant land.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you mean to be buried in the lake, too? If so, that may account for&#10;the feeling.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis little likely, gal; 'tis little likely; but there's a region for&#10;Christian souls, where there's no lakes, nor woods, they say; though why&#10;there should be none of the last, is more than I can account for; seeing&#10;that pleasantness and peace is the object in view. My grave will be&#10;found in the forest, most likely, but I hope my spirit will not be far&#10;from your'n.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So it must be, then. I am too weak-minded to understand these things,&#10;but I feel that you and I will meet again. Sister, where are you? I&#10;can't see, now, anything but darkness. It must be night, surely!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! Hetty, I am here at your side; these are my arms that are around&#10;you,&quot; sobbed Judith. &quot;Speak, dearest; is there anything you wish to say,&#10;or have done, in this awful moment.&quot;&#10;&#10;By this time Hetty's sight" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;What shall I say, Judith?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, whatever your own pure spirit teaches, my love. Trust to that, and&#10;you need fear nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good bye, Hurry,&quot; murmured the girl, with a gentle pressure of his&#10;hand. &quot;I wish you would try and be more like Deerslayer.&quot;&#10;&#10;These words were uttered with difficulty; a faint flush succeeded them&#10;for a single instant. Then the hand was relinquished, and Hetty turned&#10;her face aside, as if done with the world. The mysterious feeling&#10;that bound her to the young man, a sentiment so gentle as to be almost&#10;imperceptible to herself, and which could never have existed at all, had&#10;her reason possessed more command over her senses, was forever lost in&#10;thoughts of a more elevated, though scarcely of a purer character.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of what are you thinking, my sweet sister?&quot; whispered Judith &quot;Tell me,&#10;that I may aid you at this moment.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mother--I see Mother, now, and bright beings around her in the lake.&#10;Why isn't father there? It's odd that I can see Mother, when I can't see" />
    <node id=", at such&#10;a moment, than at any other. &quot;Hurry is well, and Deerslayer is well, and&#10;the Delaware is well, too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How came they to shoot a poor girl like me, and let so many men go&#10;unharmed? I didn't know that the Hurons were so wicked, Judith!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twas an accident, poor Hetty; a sad accident it has been! No one would&#10;willingly have injured you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm glad of that!--I thought it strange; I am feeble minded, and the&#10;redmen have never harmed me before. I should be sorry to think that they&#10;had changed their minds. I am glad too, Judith, that they haven't hurt&#10;Hurry. Deerslayer I don't think God will suffer any one to harm. It&#10;was very fortunate the soldiers came as they did though, for fire will&#10;burn!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was indeed fortunate, my sister; God's holy name be forever blessed&#10;for the mercy!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I dare say, Judith, you know some of the officers; you used to know so&#10;many!&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith made no reply; she hid her face" />
    <node id=" time that morning spoke to her&#10;companion. She said but little; merely uttering a simple request to&#10;stop, for a minute or two, ere she left the place.&#10;&#10;&quot;I may never see this spot again, Deerslayer,&quot; she said, &quot;and it&#10;contains the bodies of my mother and sister! Is it not possible, think&#10;you, that the innocence of one of these beings may answer in the eyes of&#10;God for the salvation of both?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't understand it so, Judith, though I'm no missionary, and am but&#10;poorly taught. Each spirit answers for its own backslidings, though a&#10;hearty repentance will satisfy God's laws.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then must my poor poor mother be in heaven! Bitterly, bitterly has she&#10;repented of her sins, and surely her sufferings in this life ought to&#10;count as something against her sufferings in the next!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;All this goes beyond me, Judith. I strive to do right, here, as the&#10;surest means of keeping all right, hereafter. Hetty was oncommon, as&#10;all that know'd her must allow, and her soul was as fit to cons" />
    <node id="Judith asks Deerslayer this question, suspecting that the reason he cannot love her is because of something Henry March said about her. However, Deerslayer does not mention Henry March in his answer. Instead, he tells Judith that he values their relationship highly and would risk everything for her, but he does not feel the desire to leave his own people to be with her as a husband might do. He encourages Judith to speak openly and honestly about her feelings, despite societal expectations for women to be more reserved. Deerslayer's answer to Judith's question is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it implies that he simply does not feel the romantic love for Judith that she desires from him." />
    <node id=" a steadiness and quiet in the manner of&#10;Deerslayer that completely smothered her hopes, and told her that for&#10;once her exceeding beauty had failed to excite the admiration and homage&#10;it was wont to receive. Women are said seldom to forgive those who&#10;slight their advances, but this high spirited and impetuous girl&#10;entertained no shadow of resentment, then or ever, against the fair&#10;dealing and ingenuous hunter. At the moment, the prevailing feeling was&#10;the wish to be certain that there was no misunderstanding. After another&#10;painful pause, therefore, she brought the matter to an issue by a&#10;question too direct to admit of equivocation.&#10;&#10;&quot;God forbid that we lay up regrets, in after life, through my want of&#10;sincerity now,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope we understand each other, at least.&#10;You will not accept me for a wife, Deerslayer?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis better for both that I shouldn't take advantage of your own&#10;forgetfulness, Judith. We can never marry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You do not love me,--cannot find it in your heart, perhaps, to esteem&#10;me, Deerslayer!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id=" in your answer. I know you do not love another&#10;and I can see but one reason why you cannot, will not love me. Tell me&#10;then, Deerslayer,&quot; The girl paused, the words she was about to utter&#10;seeming to choke her. Then rallying all her resolution, with a face that&#10;flushed and paled at every breath she drew, she continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me then, Deerslayer, if anything light of me, that Henry March has&#10;said, may not have influenced your feelings?&quot;&#10;&#10;Truth was the Deerslayer's polar star. He ever kept it in view, and it&#10;was nearly impossible for him to avoid uttering it, even when prudence&#10;demanded silence. Judith read his answer in his countenance, and with a&#10;heart nearly broken by the consciousness of undue erring, she signed to&#10;him an adieu, and buried herself in the woods. For some time Deerslayer&#10;was irresolute as to his course; but, in the end, he retraced his steps,&#10;and joined the Delaware. That night the three camped on the head waters&#10;of their own river, and the succeeding evening they entered the village&#10;of the tribe" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;You do not love me,--cannot find it in your heart, perhaps, to esteem&#10;me, Deerslayer!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Everything in the way of fri'ndship, Judith--everything, even to&#10;sarvices and life itself. Yes, I'd risk as much for you, at this moment,&#10;as I would risk in behalf of Hist, and that is sayin' as much as I can&#10;say of any darter of woman. I do not think I feel towards either--mind I&#10;say either, Judith--as if I wished to quit father and mother--if father&#10;and mother was livin', which, howsever, neither is--but if both was&#10;livin', I do not feel towards any woman as if I wish'd to quit 'em in&#10;order to cleave unto her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is enough!&quot; answered Judith, in a rebuked and smothered voice.&#10;&quot;I understand all that you mean. Marry you cannot with loving, and that&#10;love you do not feel for me. Make no answer, if I am right, for I shall&#10;understand your silence. That will be painful enough of itself.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer" />
    <node id=" without casting a single glance&#10;behind her. Even Hist was passed unnoticed, that modest young creature&#10;shrinking from the averted face of Judith, as if guilty herself of some&#10;wrongdoing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Wait you here, Sarpent,&quot; said Deerslayer as he followed in the&#10;footsteps of the dejected beauty, while passing his friend. &quot;I will just&#10;see Judith among her party, and come and j'ine you.&quot;&#10;&#10;A hundred yards had hid the couple from those in front, as well as those&#10;in their rear, when Judith turned, and spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;This will do, Deerslayer,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;I understand your kindness&#10;but shall not need it. In a few minutes I shall reach the soldiers. As&#10;you cannot go with me on the journey of life, I do not wish you to go&#10;further on this. But, stop--before we part, I would ask you a single&#10;question. And I require of you, as you fear God, and reverence the&#10;truth, not to deceive me in your answer. I know you do not love another&#10;and I can see but one reason why you cannot, will not love me. Tell me&#10;then" />
    <node id="The predominant emotion displayed by Judith when she arrives at the glimmerglass is deep, heart-felt sorrow. This is evident in her facial expressions, which change from deep flush of mortification to paleness due to disappointment. She pays no attention to the soldiers who have disembarked before her or to Hist, who shrinks away from Judith's averted face.&#10;&#10;Judith proceeds immediately to follow the soldiers without acknowledging them or her surroundings because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and emotions. The glimmerglass has lost its charm for her as she focuses on the preservation of Hetty's secret, which she mentions several times during their conversation. Judith's primary concern at this point is to care for her dying sister and not get distracted by other things around her." />
    <node id=" absent, though the colour frequently&#10;changed from the deep flush of mortification to the paleness of&#10;disappointment. Sorrow, deep, heart-felt sorrow, however, was the&#10;predominant emotion, and this was betrayed in a manner not to be&#10;mistaken.&#10;&#10;As neither labored hard at the paddle, the ark had already arrived&#10;and the soldiers had disembarked before the canoe of the two loiterers&#10;reached the point. Chingachgook had preceded it, and was already some&#10;distance in the wood, at a spot where the two trails, that to the&#10;garrison and that to the villages of the Delawares, separated. The&#10;soldiers, too, had taken up their line of march, first setting the Ark&#10;adrift again, with a reckless disregard of its fate. All this Judith&#10;saw, but she heeded it not. The glimmerglass had no longer any charms&#10;for her, and when she put her foot on the strand, she immediately&#10;proceeded on the trail of the soldiers without casting a single glance&#10;behind her. Even Hist was passed unnoticed, that modest young creature&#10;shrinking from the averted face of Judith, as if" />
    <node id=" eye escaped his own keen glances. Hurry completed the group, being&#10;seated on a stool near the door, like one who felt himself out of place&#10;in such a scene, but who was ashamed to quit it, unbidden.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who is that in scarlet?&quot; asked Hetty, as soon as the Captain's uniform&#10;caught her eye. &quot;Tell me, Judith, is it the friend of Hurry?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis the officer who commands the troops that have rescued us all from&#10;the hands of the Hurons,&quot; was the low answer of the sister.&#10;&#10;&quot;Am I rescued, too!--I thought they said I was shot, and about to die.&#10;Mother is dead; and so is father; but you are living, Judith, and so&#10;is Hurry. I was afraid Hurry would be killed, when I heard him shouting&#10;among the soldiers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind--never mind, dear Hetty--&quot; interrupted Judith, sensitively&#10;alive to the preservation of her sister's secret, more, perhaps, at such&#10;a moment, than at any other. &quot;Hurry is well, and Deerslayer is well, and&#10;the Delaware is well," />
    <node id=", dearest; is there anything you wish to say,&#10;or have done, in this awful moment.&quot;&#10;&#10;By this time Hetty's sight had entirely failed her. Nevertheless death&#10;approached with less than usual of its horrors, as if in tenderness to&#10;one of her half-endowed faculties. She was pale as a corpse, but her&#10;breathing was easy and unbroken, while her voice, though lowered almost&#10;to a whisper, remained clear and distinct. When her sister put this&#10;question, however, a blush diffused itself over the features of the&#10;dying girl, so faint however as to be nearly imperceptible; resembling&#10;that hue of the rose which is thought to portray the tint of modesty,&#10;rather than the dye of the flower in its richer bloom. No one but Judith&#10;detected this exposure of feeling, one of the gentle expressions of&#10;womanly sensibility, even in death. On her, however, it was not lost,&#10;nor did she conceal from herself the cause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hurry is here, dearest Hetty,&quot; whispered the sister, with her face so&#10;near the sufferer as to keep the words from other ears. &quot;Shall I" />
    <node id=" fortunate, sir,&quot; returned the girl huskily,&#10;again concealing her face. &quot;To me the world is full of misery. I wish&#10;never to hear of marks, or rifles, or soldiers, or men, again!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know my sister?&quot; asked Hetty, ere the rebuked soldier had time&#10;to rally for an answer. &quot;How came you to know that her name is Judith?&#10;You are right, for that is her name; and I am Hetty; Thomas Hutter's&#10;daughters.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For heaven's sake, dearest sister; for my sake, beloved Hetty,&quot;&#10;interposed Judith, imploringly, &quot;say no more of this!&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty looked surprised, but accustomed to comply, she ceased her awkward&#10;and painful interrogations of Warley, bending her eyes towards the Bible&#10;which she still held between her hands, as one would cling to a casket&#10;of precious stones in a shipwreck, or a conflagration. Her mind now&#10;adverted to the future, losing sight, in a great measure, of the scenes&#10;of the past.&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall not long be parted, Judith,&quot; she said" />
    <node id=" other was alluded to as Mr., which&#10;was equivalent to Ensign Thornton. The former it will at once be seen&#10;was the officer who had been named with so much feeling in the parting&#10;dialogue between Judith and Hurry. He was, in truth, the very individual&#10;with whom the scandal of the garrisons had most freely connected the&#10;name of this beautiful but indiscreet girl. He was a hard featured, red&#10;faced man of about five and thirty; but of a military carriage, and with&#10;an air of fashion that might easily impose on the imagination of one as&#10;ignorant of the world as Judith.&#10;&#10;&quot;Craig is covering us with benedictions,&quot; observed this person to his&#10;young ensign, with an air of indifference, as he shut the glass and&#10;handed it to his servant; &quot;to say the truth, not without reason; it is&#10;certainly more agreeable to be here in attendance on Miss Judith Hutter,&#10;than to be burying Indians on a point of the lake, however romantic the&#10;position, or brilliant the victory. By the way, Wright--is Davis still&#10;living?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He died about ten minutes since, your honor,&quot; returned the sergeant to&#10;whom" />
    <node id="The officer in scarlet is the one who commands the troops that have rescued Hetty and the others from the Hurons. He is not specifically named in the narrative, but he is distinguished by his red uniform, which catches Hetty's attention. His role is to lead the soldiers who came to their aid, providing protection and liberation from their captors." />
    <node id=" dare say, Judith, you know some of the officers; you used to know so&#10;many!&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith made no reply; she hid her face in her hands and groaned. Hetty&#10;gazed at her in wonder; but naturally supposing her own situation was&#10;the cause of this grief, she kindly offered to console her sister.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't mind me, dear Judith,&quot; said the affectionate and pure-hearted&#10;creature, &quot;I don't suffer; if I do die, why father and mother are both&#10;dead, and what happens to them may well happen to me. You know I am&#10;of less account than any of the family; therefore few will think of me&#10;after I'm in the lake.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no, no--poor, dear, dear Hetty!&quot; exclaimed Judith, in an&#10;uncontrollable burst of sorrow, &quot;I, at least, will ever think of you;&#10;and gladly, oh! how gladly would I exchange places with you, to be the&#10;pure, excellent, sinless creature you are!&quot;&#10;&#10;Until now, Captain Warley had stood leaning against the door of the&#10;cabin; when this outbreak of feeling, and per" />
    <node id="In response to Judith's hopes about her mother's salvation, Deerslayer expresses his limited understanding of religious matters. He tells Judith that he strives to do right in his own life as a means of ensuring his salvation and believes that each person is responsible for their own sins. However, he also acknowledges Judith's belief that her mother may be in heaven due to her repentance and suffering, implying that he finds some merit in her argument. Ultimately, Deerslayer's response shows respect for Judith's beliefs while also indicating his own limited understanding of religious matters." />
    <node id=" to it, after we have seen the priest at the fort, and never&#10;quit it again, until God calls us away to that world where we shall find&#10;the spirits of my poor mother and sister.&quot;&#10;&#10;A long, thoughtful pause succeeded; Judith here covered her face with&#10;both her hands, after forcing herself to utter so plain a proposal, and&#10;Deerslayer musing equally in sorrow and surprise, on the meaning of&#10;the language he had just heard. At length the hunter broke the silence,&#10;speaking in a tone that was softened to gentleness by his desire not to&#10;offend.&#10;&#10;&quot;You haven't thought well of this, Judith,&quot; he said, &quot;no, your feelin's&#10;are awakened by all that has lately happened, and believin' yourself to&#10;be without kindred in the world, you are in too great haste to find some&#10;to fill the places of them that's lost.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Were I living in a crowd of friends, Deerslayer, I should still think&#10;as I now think--say as I now say,&quot; returned Judith, speaking with her&#10;hands still shading her lovely face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, gal--thank you, from the bottom of my heart." />
    <node id="1. The day after Deerslayer and Hurry rescue Hetty and Judith from the Hurons is a melancholy one filled with activity.

This scene leaves a saddened feeling on all the gentlemen of the party, and the rest feel the influence of a similar sensation in various ways and for many causes.&#10;2. Hetty's body is laid to rest in the lake by her mother's side. The group mourns her loss, with Judith expressing her wish to be buried there as well.&#10;3. Hetty, still holding her Bible, begins to think about the future and speaks of not being parted from Judith for long when she dies. She mentions having thought of burying herself after their mother's death but says God kept her from that sin and has forgiven it. Judith is surprised since Hetty never lies.&#10;4. The group includes an officer in a red uniform, who commanded the troops that rescued them. Hetty, noticing his uniform, asks if he is Hurry's friend. Judith clarifies that he is the officer who led the soldiers who saved them all from the Hurons." />

    <node id="The narrative does not provide a direct explanation of Deerslayer's feelings towards war. However, based on his actions and character, it can be inferred that he has a complex relationship with warfare. As a skilled hunter and warrior, Deerslayer is proficient in fighting and killing when necessary, but he also shows regret and sadness over the loss of life. He prefers to avoid shedding blood whenever possible, even in situations where it may be expected or required of him. His experiences and beliefs have led him to value human life highly and approach war with caution and reluctance. Therefore, while Deerslayer is capable of engaging in war, he does not relish in it and likely sees it as a last resort." />
    <node id="After fifteen years, Deerslayer and Chingachgook returned to Glimmerglass because they were hastening to the forts to join their allies, as a peace had intervened and another war was rising. When they reached the lake in the early morning, they discovered one of the canoes drifted on the shore in a state of decay. After putting it in a state for service, they all embarked and examined the place, passing all the points and landing at the spot where the Hurons had first encamped and where Chingachgook had succeeded in stealing his bride. They also visited the scene of the battle and found human bones bleaching in the rains of summer. The remains of the castle were still visible, but it had been unroofed by storms and decay had eaten into the logs. All fastenings were untouched, but wild beasts had disinterred many of the bodies. Chingachgook and Deerslayer left the spot with melancholy feelings as it reminded them of their First War Path and carried back their minds to scenes of tenderness and hours of triumph." />
    <node id=" connection.&#10;&#10;Fifteen years had passed away, ere it was in the power of the Deerslayer&#10;to revisit the Glimmerglass. A peace had intervened, and it was on the&#10;eve of another and still more important war, when he and his constant&#10;friend, Chingachgook, were hastening to the forts to join their allies.&#10;A stripling accompanied them, for Hist already slumbered beneath&#10;the pines of the Delawares, and the three survivors had now become&#10;inseparable. They reached the lake just as the sun was setting. Here all&#10;was unchanged. The river still rushed through its bower of trees; the&#10;little rock was washing away, by the slow action of the waves, in the&#10;course of centuries, the mountains stood in their native dress, dark,&#10;rich and mysterious, while the sheet glistened in its solitude, a&#10;beautiful gem of the forest.&#10;&#10;The following morning, the youth discovered one of the canoes drifted&#10;on the shore, in a state of decay.

That night the three camped on the head waters&#10;of their own river, and the succeeding evening they entered the village&#10;of the tribe, Chingachgook and his betrothed in triumph; their companion&#10;honored and admired, but in a sorrow that it required months of activity&#10;to remove.&#10;&#10;The war that then had its rise was stirring and bloody. The Delaware&#10;chief rose among his people, until his name was never mentioned without&#10;eulogiums, while another Uncas, the last of his race, was added to the&#10;long line of warriors who bore that distinguishing appellation. As for&#10;the Deerslayer, under the sobriquet of Hawkeye, he made his fame spread&#10;far and near, until the crack of his rifle became as terrible to the&#10;ears of the Mingos as the thunders of the Manitou. His services were&#10;soon required by the officers of the crown, and he especially attached&#10;himself in the field to one in particular, with whose after life he had&#10;a close and important connection.&#10;&#10;Fifteen years had passed away, ere it was in the power of the Deerslayer&#10;to revisit the Glimmerglass." />
    <node id=" A little labor put it in a state for&#10;service, and they all embarked, with a desire to examine the place. All&#10;the points were passed, and Chingachgook pointed out to his son the&#10;spot where the Hurons had first encamped, and the point whence he had&#10;succeeded in stealing his bride. Here they even landed, but all traces&#10;of the former visit had disappeared. Next they proceeded to the scene of&#10;the battle, and there they found a few of the signs that linger around&#10;such localities. Wild beasts had disinterred many of the bodies, and&#10;human bones were bleaching in the rains of summer. Uncas regarded all&#10;with reverence and pity, though traditions were already rousing his&#10;young mind to the ambition and sternness of a warrior.&#10;&#10;From the point, the canoe took its way toward the shoal, where the&#10;remains of the castle were still visible, a picturesque ruin. The storms&#10;of winter had long since unroofed the house, and decay had eaten into&#10;the logs. All the fastenings were untouched, but the seasons rioted&#10;in the place, as if in mockery at the attempt to exclude them. The" />

Accident or&#10;tradition had rendered it again a spot sacred to nature, the frequent&#10;wars and the feeble population of the colonies still confining the&#10;settlements within narrow boundaries. Chingachgook and his friend left&#10;the spot with melancholy feelings. It had been the region of their First&#10;War Path, and it carried back the minds of both to scenes of tenderness,&#10;as well as to hours of triumph. They held their way towards the Mohawk&#10;in silence, however, to rush into new adventures, as stirring and as&#10;remarkable as those which had attended their opening careers on this&#10;lovely lake. At a later day they returned to the place, where the Indian&#10;found a grave.&#10;&#10;Time and circumstances have drawn an impenetrable mystery around all&#10;else connected with the Hutters.

    <node id="The narrative mentions that Hetty, who previously had excellent eyesight, suddenly starts having difficulty seeing. She finds it hard to recognize people and things around her, even though she can still make out some features. This decline in vision could be due to a number of reasons, such as physical illness or stress. However, considering Hetty's situation and her own speculation about her &quot;feeble&quot; mind, it is likely that this change in her vision might also be indicative of some mental decline, possibly due to the emotional trauma she has experienced.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Hetty herself attributes her poor eyesight to her weakened mind, saying &quot;my mind was feeble--what people call half-witted--but my eyes were so good!&quot; This suggests that she might be experiencing some form of mental distress or cognitive impairment, which could be affecting her perception and interpretation of the world around her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty's sudden decline in vision could be due to a combination of physical and psychological factors, including stress, trauma, and possibly some form of mental decline." />
    <node id=" creature you are!&quot;&#10;&#10;Until now, Captain Warley had stood leaning against the door of the&#10;cabin; when this outbreak of feeling, and perchance of penitence,&#10;however, escaped the beautiful girl, he walked slowly and thoughtfully&#10;away; even passing the ensign, then suffering under the surgeon's care,&#10;without noticing him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have got my Bible here, Judith,&quot; returned her sister in a voice of&#10;triumph. &quot;It's true, I can't read any longer, there's something the&#10;matter with my eyes--you look dim and distant--and so does Hurry, now&#10;I look at him--well, I never could have believed that Henry March would&#10;have so dull a look! What can be the reason, Judith, that I see so&#10;badly, to-day? I, who mother always said had the best eyes in the&#10;whole family. Yes, that was it: my mind was feeble--what people call&#10;half-witted--but my eyes were so good!&quot;&#10;&#10;Again Judith groaned; this time no feeling of self, no retrospect of&#10;the past caused the pain.

    <node id="1. The condition of Hetty: Hetty is in a state of extreme emotional distress and possibly mental decline after being rescued from the Hurons. She has difficulty seeing people and things around her, and she appears to be disoriented and confused. She also exhibits signs of cognitive impairment, such as struggling to recognize people and recall information.&#10;&#10;2. Hope for Hetty's survival: Although Mr. Warley does not explicitly state whether there is hope for Hetty's survival, he mentions that she is engaged in a &quot;sort of arbitrament between life and death&quot; in her mind. This suggests that her emotional and mental state is precarious, but it also leaves open the possibility of recovery.&#10;3. Examining her arm: Mr. Warley believes that examining Hetty's injured arm will help them understand the workings of the human mind because he sees her situation as an &quot;interesting study&quot; for a philosopher. By observing how Hetty responds to physical pain and emotional trauma, they may gain insights into how the human mind processes and copes with extreme situations." />
    <node id=" we may be found as resigned&#10;to go on the half pay of another existence, as this poor demented&#10;chiel!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is there no hope that she can survive the hurt?&quot; demanded Warley,&#10;turning his eyes towards the pallid Judith, on whose cheeks, however,&#10;two large spots of red had settled as soon as he came into the cabin.&#10;&#10;&quot;No more than there is for Chairlie Stuart! Approach and judge for&#10;yourselves, gentlemen; ye'll see faith exemplified in an exceeding and&#10;wonderful manner. There is a sort of arbitrium between life and&#10;death, in actual conflict in the poor girl's mind, that renders her an&#10;interesting study to a philosopher. Mr. Thornton, I'm at your service,&#10;now; we can just look at the arm in the next room, while we speculate as&#10;much as we please on the operations and sinuosities of the human mind.&quot;&#10;&#10;The surgeon and ensign retired, and Warley had an opportunity of looking&#10;about him more at leisure, and with a better understanding of the nature&#10;and feelings of the group collected in the cabin. Poor Hetty had&#10;been placed on her own simple bed, and" />
    <node id="The platform with measured tread refers to a military platform where Captain Warley, Ensign Thornton, and twenty other soldiers are gathered. They are preparing for a reconnaissance mission to observe the shore where they can see signs of their enemies, including scarlet coats moving among the trees and the sad duty of burials going on. Some of the soldiers have wounds from recent resistance, indicating that there was a recent conflict.

Their arms were stacked under the eye of&#10;their comrade on post. Two officers stood examining the shore, with the&#10;ship's glass so often mentioned. Their looks were directed to that&#10;fatal point, where scarlet coats were still to be seen gliding among&#10;the trees, and where the magnifying power of the instrument also showed&#10;spades at work, and the sad duty of interment going on. Several of the&#10;common men bore proofs on their persons that their enemies had not&#10;been overcome entirely without resistance, and the youngest of the two&#10;officers on the platform wore an arm in a sling. His companion, who&#10;commanded the party, had been more fortunate. He it was who used the&#10;glass, in making the reconnoissances in which the two were engaged.&#10;&#10;A sergeant approached to make a report. He addressed the senior of these&#10;officers as Capt. Warley, while the other was alluded to as Mr., which&#10;was equivalent to Ensign Thornton. The former it will at once be seen&#10;was the officer who had been named" />

Quite True--Go into the ark, sergeant, and tell Dr. Graham I desire&#10;he would look at Mr. Thornton's injury, as soon as he has done with the&#10;poor fellow with the broken leg. A lovely creature! and she looked like&#10;a queen in that brocade dress in which we met her. I find all changed&#10;here; father and mother both gone, the sister dying, if not dead,&#10;and none of the family left, but the beauty! This has been a lucky&#10;expedition all round, and promises to terminate better than Indian&#10;skirmishes in general.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Am I to suppose, sir, that you are about to desert your colours, in the&#10;great corps of bachelors, and close the campaign with matrimony?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I, Tom Warley, turn Benedict!

I never knew a man who could&#10;hold out long, if he had a hole in his stomach.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; it is rather inconvenient for carrying away any thing very&#10;nourishing,&quot; observed Warley, gaping. &quot;This being up two nights de&#10;suite, Arthur, plays the devil with a man's faculties!

The rattling of the drum broke the silence of that tranquil&#10;water, and the echoes of the tattoo were heard among the mountains,&#10;so soon after the ceremony was over as to preclude the danger of&#10;interruption. That star which had been the guide of Hist, rose on a&#10;scene as silent as if the quiet of nature had never yet been disturbed&#10;by the labors or passions of man. One solitary sentinel, with his&#10;relief, paced the platform throughout the night, and morning was ushered&#10;in, as usual, by the martial beat of the reveille.&#10;&#10;Military precision succeeded to the desultory proceedings of border men,&#10;and when a hasty and frugal breakfast was taken, the party began its&#10;movement towards the shore with a regularity and order that prevented&#10;noise or confusion. Of all the officers, Warley alone remained. Craig&#10;headed the detachment in advance, Thornton was with the wounded, and&#10;Graham accompanied his patients as a matter of course.

    <node id="After the Hurons set up camp at a point of land, they experience a series of tragic events, including their defeat in battle and subsequent massacre. However, by the next day, the scene has changed significantly, with night falling and drawing its veil over the lake and wilderness. The trunks of the trees, leaves, and smoke had concealed much of what had occurred, sparing the more tender-minded and timid from witnessing the gruesome aftermath.&#10;&#10;When light returns, the group examines the place, passing by all the points and landing at the spot where the Hurons had first encamped. They visit the scene of the battle and find human bones bleaching in the rains of summer, with wild beasts having disinterred many of the bodies. The remains of the castle are still visible, but it has been unroofed by storms and decay has eaten into the logs. Chingachgook and Deerslayer leave the spot with melancholy feelings, as the scene reminds them of their First War Path and carries their minds back to scenes of tenderness and hours of triumph.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene changes dramatically from one of violence and tragedy to a serene and concealed landscape, hiding the events that had taken place." />

Happily for the more tender-minded&#10;and the more timid, the trunks of the trees, the leaves, and the smoke&#10;had concealed much of that which passed, and night shortly after drew&#10;its veil over the lake, and the whole of that seemingly interminable&#10;wilderness; which may be said to have then stretched, with few and&#10;immaterial interruptions, from the banks of the Hudson to the shores of&#10;the Pacific Ocean. Our business carries us into the following day, when&#10;light returned upon the earth, as sunny and as smiling as if nothing&#10;extraordinary had occurred" />
    <node id="Judith asked Deerslayer to stop the canoe near the graves of the dead as they were heading towards the distant point to pay respects to her sister, Hetty, who was accidentally killed during the final scene of their tale. Judith wanted to ensure that Hetty received a proper burial and was given the chance to mourn for her sister. This action also highlights Judith's emotional state and her concern for her loved ones, despite the challenges they faced in the wilderness." />
    <node id=". Make no answer, if I am right, for I shall&#10;understand your silence. That will be painful enough of itself.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer obeyed her, and he made no reply. For more than a minute, the&#10;girl riveted her bright eyes on him as if to read his soul, while he&#10;was playing with the water like a corrected school boy. Then Judith,&#10;herself, dropped the end of her paddle, and urged the canoe away from&#10;the spot, with a movement as reluctant as the feelings which controlled&#10;it. Deerslayer quietly aided the effort, however, and they were soon on&#10;the trackless line taken by the Delaware.&#10;&#10;In their way to the point, not another syllable was exchanged between&#10;Deerslayer and his fair companion. As Judith sat in the bow of the&#10;canoe, her back was turned towards him, else it is probable the&#10;expression of her countenance might have induced him to venture some&#10;soothing terms of friendship and regard. Contrary to what would have&#10;been expected, resentment was still absent, though the colour frequently&#10;changed from the deep flush of mortification to the paleness of&#10;disappointment. Sorrow, deep, heart-" />
    <node id=" renewed&#10;intercourse. When all were on board, the sweeps were manned, and the Ark&#10;moved in its sluggish manner towards the distant point. Deerslayer and&#10;Chingachgook now lifted two of the canoes from the water, and placed&#10;them in the castle. The windows and door were then barred, and the&#10;house was left by means of the trap, in the manner already described. On&#10;quitting the palisades, Hist was seen in the remaining canoe, where&#10;the Delaware immediately joined her, and paddled away, leaving Judith&#10;standing alone on the platform. Owing to this prompt proceeding,&#10;Deerslayer found himself alone with the beautiful and still weeping&#10;mourner. Too simple to suspect anything, the young man swept the light&#10;boat round, and received its mistress in it, when he followed the course&#10;already taken by his friend. The direction to the point led diagonally&#10;past, and at no great distance from, the graves of the dead. As the&#10;canoe glided by, Judith for the first time that morning spoke to her&#10;companion. She said but little; merely uttering a simple request to&#10;stop, for a minute or two, e" />
    <node id=" heart of Deerslayer beat quick, as he found a ribbon of Judith's&#10;fluttering from a log. It recalled all her beauty, and we may add&#10;all her failings. Although the girl had never touched his heart, the&#10;Hawkeye, for so we ought now to call him, still retained a kind and&#10;sincere interest in her welfare. He tore away the ribbon, and knotted it&#10;to the stock of Killdeer, which had been the gift of the girl herself.&#10;&#10;A few miles farther up the lake, another of the canoes was discovered,&#10;and on the point where the party finally landed, were found those which&#10;had been left there upon the shore. That in which the present navigation&#10;was made, and the one discovered on the eastern shore, had dropped&#10;through the decayed floor of the castle, drifted past the falling&#10;palisades, and had been thrown as waifs upon the beach.&#10;&#10;From all these signs, it was probable the lake had not been visited&#10;since the occurrence of the final scene of our tale. Accident or&#10;tradition had rendered it again a spot sacred to nature, the frequent&#10;wars and the feeble population of the colonies still conf" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Deerslayer does not explicitly give a specific reason for why he cannot marry and return Judith's affections. However, his response implies that he simply does not feel romantic love for her. When Judith asks him if he loves her, Deerslayer responds by saying that he values their relationship highly and would risk everything for her, but he does not feel the desire to leave his own people to be with her as a husband might do. He encourages Judith to speak openly and honestly about her feelings, despite societal expectations for women to be more reserved. Therefore, Deerslayer's answer implies that the reason for him not being able to marry and return Judith's affections is due to his lack of romantic love for her." />
    <node id="The faint sign of modesty that Judith notices on Hetty's face as she is about to die is a blush, which is described as &quot;resembling that hue of the rose which is thought to portray the tint of modesty, rather than the dye of the flower in its richer bloom.&quot; The cause of this expression is Hetty's realization that she has been speaking harshly to Warley and her embarrassment at revealing her feelings for him, even though it is only perceptible to Judith." />
    <node id=" dearest Hetty,&quot; whispered the sister, with her face so&#10;near the sufferer as to keep the words from other ears. &quot;Shall I tell&#10;him to come and receive your good wishes?&quot;&#10;&#10;A gentle pressure of the hand answered in the affirmative. Then Hurry&#10;was brought to the side of the pallet. It is probable that this handsome&#10;but rude woodsman had never before found himself so awkwardly placed,&#10;though the inclination which Hetty felt for him (a sort of secret&#10;yielding to the instincts of nature, rather than any unbecoming impulse&#10;of an ill-regulated imagination), was too pure and unobtrusive to have&#10;created the slightest suspicion of the circumstance in his mind. He&#10;allowed Judith to put his hard colossal hand between those of Hetty, and&#10;stood waiting the result in awkward silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is Hurry, dearest,&quot; whispered Judith, bending over her sister,&#10;ashamed to utter the words so as to be audible to herself. &quot;Speak to&#10;him, and let him go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What shall I say, Judith?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, whatever your own pure spirit teaches, my love.

    <node id="Hetty Hutter, a deeply religious and truthful character, had considered burying herself after their mother's death due to her overwhelming grief and feeling of losing her best friend. She thought of this as a solution to alleviate her pain, but soon realized it would be sinful and against God's will. Hetty believed that burying oneself while still alive is wrong because, in her words, &quot;people must die before they have any right to be buried&quot; - emphasizing the sanctity of death and the importance of respecting the natural order of life and death." />
    <node id=", and then came the last melancholy offices in honor of&#10;poor Hetty Hutter. Her body was laid in the lake, by the side of that of&#10;the mother she had so loved and reverenced, the surgeon, though actually&#10;an unbeliever, so far complying with the received decencies of life as&#10;to read the funeral service over her grave, as he had previously done&#10;over those of the other Christian slain. It mattered not; that all&#10;seeing eye which reads the heart, could not fail to discriminate between&#10;the living and the dead, and the gentle soul of the unfortunate girl&#10;was already far removed beyond the errors, or deceptions, of any human&#10;ritual. These simple rites, however, were not wholly wanting in suitable&#10;accompaniments. The tears of Judith and Hist were shed freely, and&#10;Deerslayer gazed upon the limpid water, that now flowed over one whose&#10;spirit was even purer than its own mountain springs, with glistening&#10;eyes. Even the Delaware turned aside to conceal his weakness, while&#10;the common men gazed on the ceremony with wondering eyes and chastened&#10;feelings.&#10;&#10;The business of the day closed with this pious office. By order of the&#10;command" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Judith is proposing that they cause the soldiers to leave their goods on the road until they return, so that they can easily be brought back to the house. She suggests that the lake will no longer be visited by the enemy during this war, and all of Deerslayer's skins can be readily sold at the garrison. There, he can buy the few necessities they need, as Judith wishes never to see the spot again. This plan allows Deerslayer to sell his skins and purchase what they need while also ensuring the safe transport of their goods and avoiding future visits from the enemy." />
    <node id=" returned Judith, speaking with her&#10;hands still shading her lovely face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, gal--thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Howsever, I&#10;am not one to take advantage of a weak moment, when you're forgetful of&#10;your own great advantages, and fancy 'arth and all it holds is in this&#10;little canoe. No--no--Judith, 'twould be onginerous in me; what you've&#10;offered can never come to pass!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It all may be, and that without leaving cause of repentance to any,&quot;&#10;answered Judith, with an impetuosity of feeling and manner that at once&#10;unveiled her eyes. &quot;We can cause the soldiers to leave our goods on the&#10;road, till we return, when they can easily be brought back to the house;&#10;the lake will be no more visited by the enemy, this war at least; all&#10;your skins may be readily sold at the garrison; there you can buy the&#10;few necessaries we shall want, for I wish never to see the spot, again;&#10;and Deerslayer,&quot; added the girl smiling with a sweetness and nature that&#10;the young man found it hard to resist, &quot;" />
    <node id="After Hist's ceremony, the group began to prepare for their departure from the tranquil water. The military men took charge, and the party started moving towards the shore with regularity and order, preventing any noise or confusion. However, Officer Warley was the only officer who remained behind. The different officers had specific duties, such as Craig leading the detachment in advance, Thornton taking care of the wounded, and Graham accompanying his patients.&#10;&#10;During this time, Hetty slept a little, and Deerslayer and Chingachgook left the Ark to confer together. Meanwhile, Judith was grieving for her father, and when she arose, she hid her face in her apron and wept. A long pause of more than two hours succeeded, during which Warley entered and left the cabin several times, appearing uneasy when absent and unable to remain.&#10;&#10;Later on, the Surgeon announced that Judith's father had passed away from a mortal wound, though no one knew how she received it. The elderly women, some Huron girls, and much of the warriors had fallen in the melee. Rivenoak, an injured and prisoner, was the only chief who survived.&#10;&#10;Officer Warley and his ensign, Ensign Thornton, were on the platform, using a ship's glass to observe the shore where they could see signs of their enemies.

A long pause--one of&#10;more than two hours--succeeded, during which Warley entered and left the&#10;cabin several times; apparently uneasy when absent, and yet unable to&#10;remain. He issued various orders, which his men proceeded to execute,&#10;and there was an air of movement in the party, more especially as Mr.&#10;Craig, the lieutenant, had got through the unpleasant duty of burying&#10;the dead, and had sent for instructions from the shore, desiring to know&#10;what he was to do with his detachment. During this interval Hetty&#10;slept a little, and Deerslayer and Chingachgook left the Ark to confer&#10;together. But, at the end of the time mentioned, the Surgeon passed upon&#10;the platform, and with a degree of feeling his comrades had never before&#10;observed in one of his habits, he announced that the patient" />
    <node id=" bullet had passed through her body, inflicting an injury that&#10;was known at a glance to be mortal. How this wound was received, no one&#10;knew; it was probably one of those casualties that ever accompany scenes&#10;like that related in the previous chapter.&#10;&#10;The Sumach, all the elderly women, and some of the Huron girls, had&#10;fallen by the bayonet, either in the confusion of the melee, or from&#10;the difficulty of distinguishing the sexes when the dress was so simple.&#10;Much the greater portion of the warriors suffered on the spot. A few had&#10;escaped, however, and two or three had been taken unharmed. As for&#10;the wounded, the bayonet saved the surgeon much trouble. Rivenoak had&#10;escaped with life and limb, but was injured and a prisoner. As Captain&#10;Warley and his ensign went into the Ark they passed him, seated in&#10;dignified silence in one end of the scow, his head and leg bound, but&#10;betraying no visible sign of despondency or despair. That he mourned&#10;the loss of his tribe is certain; still he did it in a manner that best&#10;became a warrior and a chief." />

    <node id="The primary emotion that Judith displays after arriving at the glimmerglass is deep, heart-felt sorrow. This is evident in her facial expressions, which change from a deep flush of mortification to paleness due to disappointment. She is preoccupied with her own thoughts and emotions, particularly the preservation of Hetty's secret and caring for her dying sister. Therefore, she pays no attention to the soldiers who have disembarked before her or to Hist, who shrinks away from Judith's averted face. She proceeds immediately on the trail of the soldiers without acknowledging them or her surroundings because she is deeply absorbed in her own emotions and concerns." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Hetty, who is Captain Graham's wife, was rescued from the Hurons during an assault. However, she sustained a fatal injury in the form of a rifle bullet wound that passed through her body. The exact circumstances under which she was injured are not explicitly stated in the text. It is also mentioned that Dr. Graham, who is the surgeon accompanying the party, attempted to save Hetty, but unfortunately, his efforts were unsuccessful and he concluded that she would not survive many more hours." />

Out of ten captains, but one is in the dilemma, and&#10;he, poor devil, is always kept at regimental headquarters, as a sort of&#10;memento mori, to the young men as they join.

He was just quitting the pallet of Hetty, with an expression of&#10;sorrowful regret on his hard, pock-marked Scottish features, that it was&#10;not usual to see there. All his assiduity had been useless, and he was&#10;compelled reluctantly to abandon the expectation of seeing the girl&#10;survive many hours. Dr. Graham was accustomed to death-bed scenes,&#10;and ordinarily they produced but little impression on him. In all that&#10;relates to religion, his was one of those minds which, in consequence&#10;of reasoning much on material things, logically and consecutively, and&#10;overlooking the total want of premises which such a theory must ever&#10;possess, through its want of a primary agent, had become sceptical;&#10;leaving a vague opinion concerning the origin of things, that, with&#10;high pretentions to philosophy, failed in the first of all philosophical&#10;principles, a cause.

His reputation became widespread, and he was soon enlisted by officers of the crown to assist in battle. He particularly attached himself to one officer, who played a significant role in his later life.&#10;2. Fifteen years passed before Hawkeye had the opportunity to return to the Glimmerglass. During this time, he gained fame as a warrior, with his rifle's sound instilling fear in the ears of the Mingos. His experiences in war and time away from the Glimmerglass transformed him into a more seasoned and well-known figure.&#10;3. Upon his return to the Glimmerglass, Hawkeye reunited with Chingachgook and discovered that Hist had passed away. The three men, including a young stripling accompanying them, explored the area around the lake, finding one of the canoes in decay on the shore. They repaired it and continued their journey together, marking the passage of time and changes that had occurred during Hawkeye's absence." />
    <node id="Judith's grief is caused by her realization that Hetty is about to die. She hides her face in her hands and groans when Hetty mentions that she will be buried in the lake. Judith says she would gladly exchange places with Hetty because she sees Hetty as a pure, excellent, and sinless creature, while she feels guilty for her own past actions (implied to be related to soldiers or men, based on her earlier conversation with Warley). Essentially, Judith believes that Hetty is more worthy of living than she is, and wishes she could take Hetty's place so that Hetty might continue to live a good life." />
    <node id="The &quot;great differences&quot; that have led to the desertion of the lake refer to the conflict and violence that has occurred in the area.

The specific cause of this conflict is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it is suggested that it may be related to the presence of soldiers or men, based on Judith's earlier conversation with Warley. Despite the fact that Hetty and her mother are buried at the lake, the group feels that it is no longer a safe place to be, making it a more secure dwelling place than ever only in their absence." />

    <node id="Judith asked Deerslayer to stop the canoe near the graves of the dead as they were heading towards the distant point to pay respects to her sister, Hetty, who was accidentally killed during the final scene of their tale. This action highlights Judith's emotional state and her concern for her loved ones, despite the challenges they faced in the wilderness. Additionally, stopping near the graves may have also been a way for Judith to find some comfort and closure in her sister's death before moving forward to their destination." />
    <node id="Judith's grief is caused by her realization that Hetty is about to die. She feels deeply sad and emotional about her sister's impending death.&#10;&#10;Judith believes her sister Hetty is a 'pure, excellent, sinless creature' compared to herself because she sees Hetty as innocent and virtuous, while she feels guilty for her own past actions. Judith's earlier conversation with Warley implies that her past actions are related to soldiers or men, which suggests that she may have engaged in behavior that she now regrets. In contrast, Hetty appears modest and blushes at the revelation of her feelings for Warley, leading Judith to view her as pure and sinless.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judith's grief is caused by Hetty's impending death, and she sees Hetty as a better person than herself due to her own feelings of guilt and regret for her past actions." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Deerslayer does not explicitly state his opinion on the possibility of one innocent person's actions affecting the salvation of another in the eyes of God. However, he shows respect for Judith's belief that her mother may be in heaven due to her repentance and suffering, implying that he finds some merit in her argument. Deerslayer himself focuses on doing right in his own life as a means of ensuring his salvation, rather than relying on the actions of others. Therefore, while he does not reject the idea outright, his opinion on the matter is not explicitly stated in the narrative." />

She wants to ensure that Hetty receives a proper burial and is given the chance to mourn for her sister, as well as find some comfort and closure in her sister's death before moving forward to their destination.&#10;3. The narrative does not mention an &quot;ark&quot; but it mentions that they are in a canoe." />
    <node id="The passage provides information about the Hutter family through the context of Hetty Hutter and her sister Judith. The Hutters were a family that lived near a lake, where their mother had passed away. Hetty, in her grief, once entertained the idea of burying herself, but she realized it was against God's will. Later, both Hetty and Judith are mentioned as having lived, erred, and died, with their sins being unfortunate and regrettable. Their names are about to be forgotten, with only a grave as a reminder. The text suggests that the Hutters had some sort of disgrace associated with them, but specific details about their crimes or misdeeds are not provided in the excerpt.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text offers some context about the Hutter family and their grave, it does not provide enough information to give a detailed account of their &quot;mysterious&quot; history of crime." />

The war between the Delaware and the Mingos began, during which the Deerslayer (now known as Hawkeye) made a name for himself with his exceptional hunting and fighting skills. His reputation became widespread, and he was soon enlisted by officers of the crown to assist in battle. He particularly attached himself to one officer, who played a significant role in his later life.&#10;2. Fifteen years passed before Hawkeye had the opportunity to return to the Glimmerglass. During this time, he gained fame as a warrior, with his rifle's sound instilling fear in the ears of the Mingos. His experiences in war and time away from the Glimmerglass transformed him into a more seasoned and well-known figure.&#10;3. Upon his return to the Glimmerglass, Hawkeye reunited with Chingachgook and discovered that Hist had passed away. The three men, including a young stripling accompanying them, explored the area around the lake, finding one of the canoes in decay on the shore. They repaired it and continued their journey together, marking the passage of time and changes that had occurred during Hawkeye's absence.">

Judith read his answer in his countenance, and with a&#10;heart nearly broken by the consciousness of undue erring, she signed to&#10;him an adieu, and buried herself in the woods. For some time Deerslayer&#10;was irresolute as to his course; but, in the end, he retraced his steps,&#10;and joined the Delaware.

However, based on his actions and character, it can be inferred that he has a complex relationship with warfare. As a skilled hunter and warrior, Deerslayer is proficient in fighting and killing when necessary, but he also shows regret and sadness over the loss of life. He prefers to avoid shedding blood whenever possible, even in situations where it may be expected or required of him. His experiences and beliefs have led him to value human life highly and approach war with caution and reluctance. Therefore, while Deerslayer is capable of engaging in war, he does not relish in it and likely sees it as a last resort.">

When Judith asks him if he loves her, Deerslayer responds by saying that he values their relationship highly and would risk everything for her, but he does not feel the desire to leave his own people to be with her as a husband might do. He encourages Judith to speak openly and honestly about her feelings, despite societal expectations for women to be more reserved. Therefore, Deerslayer's answer implies that the reason for him not being able to marry and return Judith's affections is due to his lack of romantic love for her.">

However, considering Hetty's situation and her own speculation about her &quot;feeble&quot; mind, it is likely that this change in her vision might also be indicative of some mental decline, possibly due to the emotional trauma she has experienced.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Hetty herself attributes her poor eyesight to her weakened mind, saying &quot;my mind was feeble--what people call half-witted--but my eyes were so good!&quot; This suggests that she might be experiencing some form of mental distress or cognitive impairment, which could be affecting her perception and interpretation of the world around her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty's sudden decline in vision could be due to a combination of physical and psychological factors, including stress, trauma, and possibly some form of mental decline.">

By the way, Wright--is Davis still&#10;living?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He died about ten minutes since, your honor,&quot; returned the sergeant to&#10;whom" target="The passage provides information about the Hutter family through the context of Hetty Hutter and her sister Judith. The Hutters were a family that lived near a lake, where their mother had passed away. Hetty, in her grief, once entertained the idea of burying herself, but she realized it was against God's will. Later, both Hetty and Judith are mentioned as having lived, erred, and died, with their sins being unfortunate and regrettable. Their names are about to be forgotten, with only a grave as a reminder. The text suggests that the Hutters had some sort of disgrace associated with them, but specific details about their crimes or misdeeds are not provided in the excerpt.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text offers some context about the Hutter family and their grave, it does not provide enough information to give a detailed account of their &quot;mysterious&quot; history of crime.">

He prefers to avoid shedding blood whenever possible, even in situations where it may be expected or required of him.

The Delaware&#10;chief rose among his people, until his name was never mentioned without&#10;eulogiums, while another Uncas, the last of his race, was added to the&#10;long line of warriors who bore that distinguishing appellation. As for&#10;the Deerslayer, under the sobriquet of Hawkeye, he made his fame spread&#10;far and near, until the crack of his rifle became as terrible to the&#10;ears of the Mingos as the thunders of the Manitou. His services were&#10;soon required by the officers of the crown, and he especially attached&#10;himself in the field to one in particular, with whose after life he had&#10;a close and important connection.&#10;&#10;Fifteen years had passed away, ere it was in the power of the Deerslayer&#10;to revisit the Glimmerglass." target="1. The war between the Delaware and the Mingos began, during which the Deerslayer (now known as Hawkeye) made a name for himself with his exceptional hunting and fighting skills. His reputation became widespread, and he was soon enlisted by officers of the crown to assist in battle. He particularly attached himself to one officer, who played a significant role in his later life.&#10;2. Fifteen years passed before Hawkeye had the opportunity to return to the Glimmerglass. During this time, he gained fame as a warrior, with his rifle's sound instilling fear in the ears of the Mingos. His experiences in war and time away from the Glimmerglass transformed him into a more seasoned and well-known figure.&#10;3. Upon his return to the Glimmerglass, Hawkeye reunited with Chingachgook and discovered that Hist had passed away. The three men, including a young stripling accompanying them, explored the area around the lake, finding one of the canoes in decay on the shore. They repaired it and continued their journey together, marking the passage of time and changes that had occurred during Hawkeye's absence.">

All&#10;the points were passed, and Chingachgook pointed out to his son the&#10;spot where the Hurons had first encamped, and the point whence he had&#10;succeeded in stealing his bride. Here they even landed, but all traces&#10;of the former visit had disappeared. Next they proceeded to the scene of&#10;the battle, and there they found a few of the signs that linger around&#10;such localities. Wild beasts had disinterred many of the bodies, and&#10;human bones were bleaching in the rains of summer. Uncas regarded all&#10;with reverence and pity, though traditions were already rousing his&#10;young mind to the ambition and sternness of a warrior.&#10;&#10;From the point, the canoe took its way toward the shoal, where the&#10;remains of the castle were still visible, a picturesque ruin. The storms&#10;of winter had long since unroofed the house, and decay had eaten into&#10;the logs. All the fastenings were untouched, but the seasons rioted&#10;in the place, as if in mockery at the attempt to exclude them.

However, by the next day, the scene has changed significantly, with night falling and drawing its veil over the lake and wilderness. The trunks of the trees, leaves, and smoke had concealed much of what had occurred, sparing the more tender-minded and timid from witnessing the gruesome aftermath.&#10;&#10;When light returns, the group examines the place, passing by all the points and landing at the spot where the Hurons had first encamped. They visit the scene of the battle and find human bones bleaching in the rains of summer, with wild beasts having disinterred many of the bodies. The remains of the castle are still visible, but it has been unroofed by storms and decay has eaten into the logs. Chingachgook and Deerslayer leave the spot with melancholy feelings, as the scene reminds them of their First War Path and carries their minds back to scenes of tenderness and hours of triumph.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene changes dramatically from one of violence and tragedy to a serene and concealed landscape, hiding the events that had taken place.">

Accident or&#10;tradition had rendered it again a spot sacred to nature, the frequent&#10;wars and the feeble population of the colonies still confining the&#10;settlements within narrow boundaries. Chingachgook and his friend left&#10;the spot with melancholy feelings. It had been the region of their First&#10;War Path, and it carried back the minds of both to scenes of tenderness,&#10;as well as to hours of triumph. They held their way towards the Mohawk&#10;in silence, however, to rush into new adventures, as stirring and as&#10;remarkable as those which had attended their opening careers on this&#10;lovely lake. At a later day they returned to the place, where the Indian&#10;found a grave.&#10;&#10;Time and circumstances have drawn an impenetrable mystery around all&#10;else connected with the Hutters.

The Hutters were a family that lived near a lake, where their mother had passed away. Hetty, in her grief, once entertained the idea of burying herself, but she realized it was against God's will. Later, both Hetty and Judith are mentioned as having lived, erred, and died, with their sins being unfortunate and regrettable. Their names are about to be forgotten, with only a grave as a reminder. The text suggests that the Hutters had some sort of disgrace associated with them, but specific details about their crimes or misdeeds are not provided in the excerpt.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text offers some context about the Hutter family and their grave, it does not provide enough information to give a detailed account of their &quot;mysterious&quot; history of crime.">

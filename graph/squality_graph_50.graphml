It was an ordinary day on Venus.&#10; &#10; Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth of feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together they sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.&#10; &#10; The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship Aphrodite loomed unhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the ventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the fat spaceship.&#10; &#10; &quot;It looks,&quot; he commented bitterly, &quot;like a pregnant carp.&quot;&#10; &#10; Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley—&quot;Cob&quot; to his friends—nodded in agreement. &quot;That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself.

    <node id=" the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.&#10;&quot;A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.&quot;&#10; &#10; Cob nodded agreement. &quot;The last of her class.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; And she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed Aphrodite was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten years back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation Incident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a surge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the planner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its formative stage, and at the time of the Aphrodite's launching the surge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.&#10; &#10; Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit for her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed of hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The Artemis , the Andromeda , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The three vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid had set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.&#10;" />

Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle of chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an acceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit rheostat.&#10; &#10; &quot;Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?&quot; commented Cob.&#10; &#10; Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the Ganymede's flying-bridge. &quot;But she's home to us, anyway.&quot;&#10; &#10; The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship, hugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside.

Jetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous Aphrodite had burned a steering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall while Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected repairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running ten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation Officer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the orbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.&#10; &#10; The Aphrodite rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....&#10; &#10; For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in space, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between them. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her father's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was little she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy spent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit that he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.&#10; &#10; And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike did.

Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field of vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit rheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious, but too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument panel.&#10; &#10; &quot; Ivy! &quot; Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;I ...

    <node id="Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III faces several challenges as he takes command of the T.R.S. Aphrodite at Venusport Base. Firstly, the harsh weather conditions on Venus, such as the viscous mud, greenish rain, and miasmic fog, make it difficult to navigate the surface Base. The limited visibility will require the use of porto-sonar sets to find their way around.&#10;&#10;In addition to the challenging environment, Strike also has to deal with the poor reputation of the Aphrodite. Known as the &quot;butt of the Space Navy,&quot; the ship has earned a reputation for being difficult to handle, and its previous commanders have often been sent back to Earth with nervous breakdowns.&#10;&#10;Another challenge that Strike faces is the unconventional crew of the Aphrodite. With about a quarter of their ratings being women, and Celia Graham being the only female officer, Strike feels uncomfortable having women on board his ship. Cob, the Executive Officer, shrugs off Strike's concerns, citing equal rights.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Strike must navigate the jungle of chrome piping within the ship to reach the main control panels, where he will take command. The cluttered and unfamiliar environment may pose a challenge for him as he tries to get accustomed to his new surroundings.&#10;&#10;Overall, Strike faces several challenges, both environmental and social, as he takes command of the T.R.S.

The frantic flame that lashed out from the Lachesis' tube was fading, her fission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms. Still she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she save her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles of the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences that spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for the trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins, the gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning to melt under the fierce radiance.

    <node id="The crew of the spaceship Old Aphrodisiac faced several challenges during their journey toward the orbit of Mercury. First, they experienced a steering tube burn through which required going into free-fall while repairs were made, causing them to fall ten hours behind schedule. The unforeseen changes in orbital calculations due to this free-fall time added tension for Strike and Evans, the Astrogation Officer.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the spaceship had a poor reputation for being difficult to handle, with previous commanders often sent back to Earth suffering from nervous breakdowns. This stigma contributed to Captain Strike's initial reluctance in accepting Ivy Hendricks on board, as he was not comfortable having women on his ship.&#10;&#10;The unconventional crew dynamic, consisting of approximately a quarter female ratings and one female officer (Celia Graham), created potential conflicts and tension within the crew. As they continued their journey, this tension eased as Strike developed a reluctant admiration for Ivy's knowledge of spaceship engineering and her skill at piloting.&#10;&#10;The growing relationship between Strike and Ivy Hendricks helped them overcome these obstacles through mutual respect and understanding. Ivy's expertise in spaceship engineering, as well as her fine job of piloting, improved the crew's morale and confidence in their ability to handle the challenging situation with the Lachesis and Atropos. This strengthened the crew's unity and focus on their mission, helping them overcome the initial obstacles they faced during their journey." />

There had been three. The Artemis , the Andromeda , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The three vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid had set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.&#10;">

The mission of the T.R.S. Aphrodite, as outlined by Captain Strike on the flying bridge, is to jet within 28,000,000 miles of Sol and establish a trans-Mercurian hyperbolic orbit. This approach will bring them close to the sun, causing intense heat that has affected the interior of the ship, raising its temperature to 102°F. The Aphrodite is also tasked with rescuing two other spaceships, the Lachesis and the Atropos, which are engaged in coronary research patrol but are in danger due to their failing refrigeration units and proximity to the sun's harmful radiation. The Aphrodite will approach these ships with a beryllium steel cable to tow them away from the sun's radiation.">

The fantastically misnamed Aphrodite was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten years back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation Incident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a surge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the planner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its formative stage, and at the time of the Aphrodite's launching the surge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.&#10; &#10; Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit for her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed of hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The Artemis , the Andromeda , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac.

The surge-circuit continued to be a part of the Aphrodite's design after its refit, allowing it to carry the mail in the story.">

This situation causes discomfort for the female crew members in particular.&#10;&#10;A radar contact is picked up by Ensign Graham, which turns out to be the Lachesis and Atropos, two dreadnaughts engaged in coronary research patrol. However, they are caught in a perilous situation as their refrigeration units are failing due to their proximity to the sun, causing their ships' fittings to melt under the fierce radiance. The Aphrodite, captained by Strike and with Ivy Hendricks as the E/O (Executive Officer), approaches these two ships with a beryllium steel cable to tow them away from the sun's harmful radiation. This situation is significant as it puts the Aphrodite in danger as well, but Strike and his crew are willing to risk their lives to save their comrades.">

The story suggests that Ivy Hendricks is proposing to risk the ship and its crew, including herself, to save other ships because she is confident in her knowledge of the ship and its blown skyhigh drive, rather than out of desperation or a desire to prove herself.&#10;2. This confidence comes from her being the daughter of the spaceship Aphrodite's designer, Harlan Hendricks, and her belief that she has been trained in her father's designs and spacecraft engineering.&#10;3. Ivy's goal is to disprove any negative assumptions about her father's abilities as a designer by providing evidence of her own competence and contributing to the safe operation of the spaceship.&#10;4. However, the story also suggests that there are risks involved in this decision, as making a mistake with the unreliable drive could result in catastrophic consequences for all those aboard the Aphrodite.">

His great-grandfather, David Farragut Strykalski I, emerged from World War II as a four-striper and Congressional Medal winner. His grandfather, David Farragut Strykalski Jr., won a United Nations Peace Citation during the Atomic War of 1961. However, Captain Strykalski's actions and behavior have been unbecoming of an officer from such a distinguished lineage. He left his post to help what he thought were endangered colonists (the Procyon A people), celebrated too freely with his crew which led to their imprisonment in the Luna Base brig, and called the Martian Ambassador a spy at a Tellurian Embassy Ball. His tactical astrophysicist had warned him that Procyon A might go nova, but it turned out to be a wrong guess. These incidents led to Strykalski losing command of the Ganymede, which was given to Gorman's former aide. As a result, Captain Strykalski was given command of the less-desirable monitor named Aphrodite, which is an older and slower spaceship compared to the Ganymede.">

The unforeseen changes in orbital calculations due to this free-fall time added tension for Strike and Evans, the Astrogation Officer.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the spaceship had a poor reputation for being difficult to handle, with previous commanders often sent back to Earth suffering from nervous breakdowns. This stigma contributed to Captain Strike's initial reluctance in accepting Ivy Hendricks on board, as he was not comfortable having women on his ship.&#10;&#10;The unconventional crew dynamic, consisting of approximately a quarter female ratings and one female officer (Celia Graham), created potential conflicts and tension within the crew. As they continued their journey, this tension eased as Strike developed a reluctant admiration for Ivy's knowledge of spaceship engineering and her skill at piloting.&#10;&#10;The growing relationship between Strike and Ivy Hendricks helped them overcome these obstacles through mutual respect and understanding. Ivy's expertise in spaceship engineering, as well as her fine job of piloting, improved the crew's morale and confidence in their ability to handle the challenging situation with the Lachesis and Atropos. This strengthened the crew's unity and focus on their mission, helping them overcome the initial obstacles they faced during their journey.">

Captain Strike is feeling frustrated and curses Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with feeling. He feels this way because he has been demoted from commanding the more desirable Ganymede to the Aphrodite, which he describes as looking like a pregnant carp. The Aphrodite has earned a reputation for being difficult to handle and has previously sent its commanders back to Earth with nervous breakdowns.&#10;3. Coburn Whitley, referred to as &quot;Cob,&quot; is the Executive of the Aphrodite, meaning he is second-in-command to Captain Strike. He has been with the ship for a full year, which is considered a long time for Execs on the Aphrodite, as many are sent back to Earth with nervous breakdowns in half that time.">

First, they experienced a steering tube burn through which required going into free-fall while repairs were made, causing them to fall ten hours behind schedule. The unforeseen changes in orbital calculations due to this free-fall time added tension for Strike and Evans, the Astrogation Officer.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the spaceship had a poor reputation for being difficult to handle, with previous commanders often sent back to Earth suffering from nervous breakdowns. This stigma contributed to Captain Strike's initial reluctance in accepting Ivy Hendricks on board, as he was not comfortable having women on his ship.&#10;&#10;The unconventional crew dynamic, consisting of approximately a quarter female ratings and one female officer (Celia Graham), created potential conflicts and tension within the crew. As they continued their journey, this tension eased as Strike developed a reluctant admiration for Ivy's knowledge of spaceship engineering and her skill at piloting.&#10;&#10;The growing relationship between Strike and Ivy Hendricks helped them overcome these obstacles through mutual respect and understanding. Ivy's expertise in spaceship engineering, as well as her fine job of piloting, improved the crew's morale and confidence in their ability to handle the challenging situation with the Lachesis and Atropos. This strengthened the crew's unity and focus on their mission, helping them overcome the initial obstacles they faced during their journey.">

The story suggests that Ivy Hendricks is proposing to risk the ship and its crew, including herself, to save other ships because she is confident in her knowledge of the ship and its blown skyhigh drive, rather than out of desperation or a desire to prove herself.&#10;2. This confidence comes from her being the daughter of the spaceship Aphrodite's designer, Harlan Hendricks, and her belief that she has been trained in her father's designs and spacecraft engineering.&#10;3. Ivy's goal is to disprove any negative assumptions about her father's abilities as a designer by providing evidence of her own competence and contributing to the safe operation of the spaceship.&#10;4.

    <edge source="The situation onboard the Aphrodite is that both Captain Strike and Lieutenant Hendricks (Ivy), daughter of the spaceship's designer, are facing challenging conditions as they dive into the sun. The intense heat from the sun has caused the interior of the ship to reach 102°F, affecting their ability to perform duties effectively. Ivy, who was inspecting the surge-circuit rheostat, becomes physically drained and collapses over the blistering hot instrument panel. Recognizing her condition, Strike gently places her in an acceleration chair and takes control of the situation.

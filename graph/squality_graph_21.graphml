Mitchell feels they don't have the right to ask for Macklin's assistance because of his importance in his field and the potential gravity of what Ferris has done, which involves a virus that affects brain function. They are unsure of how Macklin might react or what consequences their actions could have on their reputations and careers." />

He looked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell suspected that that was his intention.&#10; &#10; He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. &quot;Good of you to ask me over, Steven.&quot;&#10; &#10; Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. &quot;How have you been, Harold?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. &quot;Fine, thank you, doctor.&quot;&#10; &#10; Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. &quot;Now what's this about you wanting my help on something?

He's legally responsible, but he's extremely stupid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm not so dumb,&quot; Macklin said defensively.&#10; &#10; &quot;I beg your pardon, sir,&quot; Carson said. &quot;I didn't intend any offense.

It was known that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of the headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several weeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen around the campus.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the laboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chair behind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up?&quot; Ferris demanded, pausing in mid-stride.&#10; &#10; &quot;I imagine he will,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;Macklin's always seemed a decent enough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trustees meetings.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He's always treated me like dirt,&quot; Ferris said heatedly. &quot;Everyone on this campus treats biologists like dirt.

    <node id="The cause of headaches, according to the scientists in the story, is an effect that they have identified as being caused by an over-production of the pituitary gland, which leads to a constriction of blood vessels in the telencephalon section of the frontal lobes. This pressure effect on the brain is what produces headaches. The scientists have developed a virus that feeds on pituitrin, a substance responsible for the over-production of the pituitary gland. By artificially breeding this virus, they aim to cure headaches by localizing and stabilizing a colony of the virus in the brain cells, which will relax the cerebral vessels and prevent excessive pressure within the brain cavities. This one simple injection could potentially eradicate headaches forever." />

It's caused by an over-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a virus that feeds on pituitrin.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean the end of the race as well,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;In certain areas it is valuable to have a constriction of blood vessels.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The virus,&quot; Ferris explained, &quot;can easily be localized and stabilized. A colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral vessels—and only the cerebral vessels—so that the cerebrospinal fluid doesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain.&quot;&#10; &#10; The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. &quot;If this really works, I could" />

But that necessary amount of control to stop pain is too much to allow the brain cells to function properly.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why won't they function?&quot; Carson roared.&#10; &#10; &quot;They don't get enough food—blood, oxygen, hemoglobin,&quot; Ferris explained. &quot;The cerebral vessels don't contract enough to pump the blood through the brain as fast and as hard as is needed. The brain cells remain sluggish, dormant. Perhaps decaying.&quot;&#10; &#10; The colonel yelled.&#10; &#10; Mitchell groaned. He was abruptly sure Ferris was correct.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The colonel drew himself to attention, fists trembling at his sides.&#10;&quot;I'll see you hung for treason! Don't you know what Elliot Macklin means to us? Do you want those filthy Luxemburgians to reach Pluto before we do? Macklin's formula is essential to the FTL engine.

    <node id="1. The issue with Elliot Macklin that concerns Mitchell and Ferris is related to a virus they injected him with, called the F-M Virus, which was intended to cure his headaches. However, they made a miscalculation, and the virus overcontrolled the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum, causing Macklin's mental state to resemble that of someone who has been kicked in the head by a mule.&#10;2. Ferris thinks Macklin might be trying to get them in trouble because he suspects Macklin is aware of the consequences of their actions and may be attempting to cause difficulties for Mitchell and Ferris in terms of their reputations and careers. This suspicion arises when Macklin appears much simpler than usual, leading Ferris to believe that Macklin might be pretending or exaggerating his condition to create problems for them." />

This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr. Mitchell.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You had certainly better help him, gentlemen.&quot; She stood out of the doorway for them to pass.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Macklin was an attractive brunette in her late thirties. She wore an expensive yellow dress. And she had a sharp-cornered jawline.&#10; &#10; The Army officer came out into the hall to meet them.&#10; &#10; &quot;You are the gentlemen who gave Dr. Macklin the unauthorized injection,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; It wasn't a question.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't like that 'unauthorized',&quot; Ferris snapped.&#10; &#10; The colonel—Mitchell spotted the eagles on his green tunic—lifted a heavy eyebrow. &quot;No?

    <node id="1. The mathematician (Macklin) asks how he knows Mitchell won't try to put him back where he was instead of helping him more. Mitchell responds by saying that it would be illegal to do so against his wishes. This implies that Mitchell is abiding by the law and respecting Macklin's autonomy, which might make Macklin feel more assured.&#10;2. When Macklin expresses concern about the Army watching him closely, Mitchell suggests bringing Colonel Carson along, which shows that he is open to external supervision and accountability.&#10;3. These actions, combined with Mitchell's confident assertion that he can help Macklin get rid of his personal worries, might make Macklin feel more assured about visiting the laboratory for help. However, it is important to note that genuine trust and assurance cannot be fully achieved through words alone; they require consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity." />

    <node id="The story describes the discovery of what the scientists believe to be the &quot;one real cause&quot; of headaches, which is an effect caused by an over-production of the pituitary gland leading to a constriction of blood vessels in the brain. They have developed a virus that feeds on pituitrin, the substance responsible for the over-production of the pituitary gland, and plan to use it to cure headaches by localizing and stabilizing a colony of the virus in the brain cells, which will relax the cerebral vessels and prevent excessive pressure within the brain cavities.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that this explanation only addresses one potential cause of headaches, and it is not specified how this single injection could potentially address all types of headaches, which can have various underlying causes including nervous strain, fatigue, physical diseases, and over-indulgence. The scientists themselves acknowledge the existence of different causes for headaches, but they claim to have identified a single effect that they believe is the root cause of all headaches.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the scientists have discovered a single cure for all types of headaches, as they only address one possible cause of headaches with their proposed treatment. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of headaches, as they can have various underlying causes that require different treatments." />

Neither Dr. Ferris or myself have been near your husband for a full day. The effects of a narcotic would have worn off by this time.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Most known narcotics,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but" />
    <node id="1. If Mrs. Macklin refuses to help restore her husband's mind, the potential consequences could include legal actions against her and the possibility of her husband being declared incompetent by a court. This could lead to authorities ruling on whether Mitchell and Ferris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin to sanity.&#10;2. It is unclear whether a court would rule in favor of restoring Dr. Macklin's sanity using Mitchell and Ferris' antitoxin treatment, as it depends on various factors such as the specific laws and regulations governing medical treatments, the opinions of expert witnesses, and the persuasiveness of the arguments presented by the parties involved. However, based on Mrs. Macklin's statement that her husband has a history of vascular spasm and a mild pseudostroke, it is possible that a court may be hesitant to authorize treatments that could potentially harm Dr. Macklin's cerebral arteries and increase the risk of paralysis or death." />
    <node id=" hand. &quot;That was my original thought. But I've redecided.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Redecided!&quot; Carson burst out almost hysterically.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. I can't go against Elliot's wishes. It would be monstrous to put him back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again, where he never had a moment's peace from worry and pressure. He's happy now. Like a child, but happy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mrs. Macklin,&quot; the Army man said levelly, &quot;if you don't help us restore your husband's mind we will be forced to get a court order declaring him incompetent.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But he is not! Legally, I mean,&quot; the woman stormed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe not. It's a borderline case. But I think any court would give us the edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once he's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and Ferris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin to sanity.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; The colonel looked smug. &quot;Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because, Colonel, the matter" />
    <node id=" court would rule in that manner,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; The colonel looked smug. &quot;Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is involved.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It isn't quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of vascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to give those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To paralyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I suppose there's some chance of that. But without the treatment there is no chance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs. Macklin,&quot; Mitchell interjected.&#10; &#10; Her mouth grew petulant. &quot;I don't care. I would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him comfortable....&quot;&#10; &#10; Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led him back into the hall.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm no psychiatrist,&quot; Mitchell said, &quot;but I think she wants Macklin stupid. Prefers it" />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, the mathematician, Macklin, might be hesitant to visit Mitchell's laboratory due to concerns about the Army watching him closely and potential risks associated with the procedure. He also expresses concern about being put back in his original state against his wishes, which Mitchell assures him would be illegal.&#10;2. The mathematician might be willing to take on some level of risk or uncertainty if it means getting rid of his severe headaches, as they significantly affect his quality of life. However, he is also cautious and wants to ensure that his autonomy is respected in the process. He values his current state of peace and financial security, which might make him more reluctant to undergo any procedure that could potentially disrupt these aspects of his life." />
    <node id=" Macklin was playing jacks.&#10; &#10; He didn't have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a great curving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Pluto and the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Not his head. Mitchell's. Both heads were initialed &quot;M&quot; so it was all the same.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.&#10; &#10; He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his heart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from the nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.&#10; &#10; After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hello?&quot; Elliot Macklin said.&#10; &#10; Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the phone instead of his wife.&#10; &#10; &quot;Can you speak freely, doctor?&quot; Mitchell asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; the mathematician said. &quot;I can talk fine.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I mean, are you alone?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No" />
    <node id=" like I used to be.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, doctor,&quot; Mitchell said eagerly, &quot;just as you used to be.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; With my headaches, like before?&quot;&#10; &#10; Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to frame an answer. &quot;Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions properly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is a dismal failure.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I wouldn't go that far,&quot; Ferris remarked cheerfully.&#10; &#10; Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw Macklin slowly shaking his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, sir!&quot; the mathematician said. &quot;I shall not go back to my original state. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying, worrying.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean wondering,&quot; Mitchell said.&#10; &#10; Macklin nodded. &quot;Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing. How high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity—say, what was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It's peaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife and all the money I need. I've got" />
    <node id="Based on the conversation between Ferris and Mitchell, we can infer that Macklin's recovery from his severe migraines could have a significant impact, as he is an important figure in his field. If he were to be cured through their project, it would lend credibility to their work and potentially expedite its acceptance by the proper authorities. The public reaction could be positive, with many people being pleased about the possibility of curing headaches permanently. However, there might also be some negative consequences for Ferris and Mitchell, as they are taking a risk by working on such a project and there is always the possibility of unforeseen side effects or complications. The mathematician Macklin, while initially skeptical, ultimately decides to go through with the injection, showing his trust in Ferris and Mitchell's work despite the potential risks." />
    <node id="1. Drs. Mitchell and Ferris were summoned by Mrs. Macklin due to an unauthorized injection they had given to her husband, Elliot Macklin. Macklin is a doctor who has been experiencing severe headaches, specifically migraines. The doctors believed they could help alleviate his suffering by using the F-M Virus to cure his headaches, but they made a miscalculation which resulted in an overcontrol of the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum, causing Macklin to become simple-minded.&#10;2. There is tension between the doctors and the colonel who meets them in the hallway because the colonel is upset about the unauthorized injection given to Macklin. The colonel, Carson, questions Mitchell and Ferris about what they have done to Macklin, suspecting that they have administered narcotics without authorization. Mrs. Macklin had become hysterical when she suspected as much, leading to the doctors being called upon to explain themselves.&#10;3. The colonel is particularly critical of Mitchell and Ferris' actions because they are not medical doctors and therefore lack the authority to treat illnesses. He expresses his disapproval by questioning their motives for giving Macklin an injection without proper authorization, implying that they have acted irresponsibly by infecting Macklin with a disease and potentially damaging his brain function." />
    <node id="1. Mitchell was relieved that he reached Elliot Macklin instead of his wife because he wanted to ensure that their conversation would be private and uninterrupted, as he needed to discuss sensitive matters related to the F-M Virus and its potential risks. By speaking with Macklin directly, Mitchell could avoid any potential misunderstandings or concerns that Macklin's wife might have.&#10;2. Mitchell indicated that he needed to speak freely with the mathematician by asking if he was alone and could speak freely. This question suggested that their conversation might touch on confidential or sensitive topics, and that Macklin's responses might be influenced by external factors such as his wife's presence or potential concerns about privacy. By confirming that they were alone and could speak openly, Mitchell created a more conducive environment for discussing the F-M Virus and its potential benefits for Macklin's severe headaches." />
    <node id="1. The researchers have developed a virus that they believe can cure headaches by targeting pituitrin, a substance responsible for the over-production of the pituitary gland, which is said to be the &quot;one real cause&quot; of headaches. However, it is important to note that this explanation only addresses one potential cause of headaches and does not guarantee that it will work for all types of headaches or their various underlying causes.&#10;2. The researchers have tested the virus on animals, specifically rats and chimps, and have seen no adverse effects. However, they acknowledge that they have not yet tested it on humans.&#10;3. To increase the credibility of their discovery, the researchers have enlisted the help of a reputable doctor with chronic migraines, Dr. Macklin, to undergo the experiment. They hope that his involvement will lend more weight to their claims and expedite its acceptance by the proper authorities.&#10;4. The potential positive public reaction could be widespread acceptance and relief at the possibility of curing headaches permanently. However, there are also risks involved in working on such a project, including unforeseen side effects or complications.&#10;5. Dr. Macklin, after expressing initial skepticism, agrees to undergo the injection, showing his trust in Ferris and Mitchell's work despite the potential risks.&#10;6. To determine the effectiveness of the virus in curing headaches in humans, further testing on human volunteers is required." />
    <node id="'t create pressure in the cavities of the brain.&quot;&#10; &#10; The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. &quot;If this really works, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuff makes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than the migraine. How should I go about removing my curse?&quot; He reinserted the pipe.&#10; &#10; &quot;I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate,&quot; Ferris said. &quot;Our discovery will work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Will work,&quot; Macklin said thoughtfully. &quot;The operative word. It hasn't worked then?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly it has,&quot; Ferris said. &quot;On rats, on chimps....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But not on humans?&quot; Macklin asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not yet,&quot; Mitchell admitted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;Well.&quot; He thumped pipe ashes out into his palm.&#10;&quot;Certainly you can get volunteers. Convicts. Conscientious objectors from the Army.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We want you,&quot; Ferris told him.&#10; &#10; Macklin coughed. &quot;I don't want to overestimate my value but the government wouldn't" />
    <node id="MITchell gives several reasons for Macklin to feel assured about visiting the laboratory for help. First, Mitchell makes it clear that he is abiding by the law and respecting Macklin's autonomy by stating that he cannot put Macklin back into his previous state against his wishes, as it would be illegal. This implies that Mitchell is trustworthy and reliable.&#10;&#10;Second, when Macklin expresses concern about being closely watched by the Army, Mitchell suggests bringing Colonel Carson along. This shows that Mitchell is open to external supervision and accountability, which can help put Macklin at ease.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that genuine trust and assurance cannot be fully achieved through words alone; they require consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity. While Mitchell's words may provide some reassurance, Macklin would likely need to see evidence of Mitchell's trustworthiness over time in order to truly feel assured.&#10;&#10;In the case of Colonel Carson accompanying Macklin to the laboratory, it is unlikely that this would have a significant impact on whether or not Macklin feels manipulated or forced into his previous state. This is because the decision ultimately rests with Macklin and his own autonomy, rather than being dependent on the presence of Colonel Carson. Ultimately, Macklin would need to feel comfortable and confident in his own decision to seek help from Mitchell, regardless of any external factors." />
    <node id="1. Mitchell and Ferris were given suspicion by the Army colonel for giving an unauthorized injection to Dr. Macklin because they are not authorized medical doctors and the colonel questioned their motives for administering the injection without proper authorization, implying that they have acted irresponsibly by infecting Macklin with a disease and potentially damaging his brain function.&#10;2. Mrs. Macklin fits into this situation as she is the one who called the doctors to the scene due to her husband's altered state after receiving the injection. She suspects that the doctors have administered narcotics without authorization, leading to her hysteria and the colonel's subsequent questioning of Mitchell and Ferris. Later in the story, it is revealed that Mrs. Macklin used to be a nurse and recognizes the effects of certain drugs, which further fueled her suspicions." />
    <node id="1. Colonel Carson has assessed Dr. Macklin's intelligence based on standard intelligence tests, which classify him as a &quot;moron,&quot; a term used for individuals with significantly below-average intelligence. They are stepping into the hall to discuss this matter further because Colonel Carson wants to understand what happened to Macklin and why he is in his current state of lower intelligence." />
    <node id="1. Colonel Carson referring to Dr. Macklin as a &quot;moron&quot; based on intelligence tests signifies that Dr. Macklin has significantly below-average intelligence, which is what the term &quot;moron&quot; refers to in this context. This classification comes from standard intelligence tests administered by Colonel Carson.&#10;2. Mitchell and Ferris are asked to step outside to speak with Colonel Carson so they can discuss the matter further without disturbing others. The colonel wants to understand why Dr. Macklin is in his current state of lower intelligence, as it seems to have occurred after Mitchell and Ferris gave him an injection. By stepping into the hall, they can have a private conversation about the situation." />
    <node id="1. Based on Mitchell's conversation with Macklin, it is likely that Macklin was alone when he received the call from Mitchell since Mitchell expressed relief that he had reached Macklin instead of his wife. However, the text does not explicitly confirm this detail.&#10;2. Before receiving the call from Mitchell, Macklin was playing jacks and using Earth and Pluto, along with other planets, as his jacks. He was also using &quot;Mitchell's head&quot; as a ball, which is a metaphorical representation of their relationship and the situation they find themselves in. This scene suggests that Macklin may be experiencing some kind of altered state or hallucination since playing jacks with planetary objects and using someone's head as a ball are not possible in reality." />
    <node id="1. The researchers selected a reputable doctor with chronic migraines for their experiment because they believed that his reputation and personal experience with headaches would lend credibility to their claims of having discovered a cure for headaches. They hoped that by doing so, their discovery would be taken more seriously by the medical community and the public.&#10;2. The researchers also selected Dr. Macklin because neither of them had a history of chronic migraines or reputations as important medical professionals, which might have made it harder for them to gain acceptance for their discovery. By recruiting Dr. Macklin, they aimed to increase the likelihood of their discovery being taken seriously by the proper authorities." />
    <node id="1. The colonel is suspicious of Mitchell and Ferris because they gave an unauthorized injection to Dr. Macklin without proper authorization from the Army. The colonel implies that they may have acted irresponsibly, infecting Macklin with a disease or damaging his brain function.&#10;2. Mrs. Macklin becomes hysterical when she suspects that Mitchell and Ferris have given her husband narcotics without authorization. This is because she used to be a nurse and recognizes the effects of certain drugs, which fuels her suspicions.&#10;3. In response to the colonel's accusation, Mitchell and Ferris maintain that they were not treating an illness but rather attempting to cure Macklin's headaches with their F-M Virus injection. They believe that the virus overcontrols the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum, causing a miscalculation that resulted in Macklin's current simple-minded state.&#10;4. In this quote, Mitchell is asking Mrs. Macklin if she suspects that her husband was given heroin during his last treatment, even though the effects of such a narcotic should have worn off by now. Mitchell is trying to determine if Mrs. Macklin still harbors suspicions about their administration of unauthorized drugs to her husband." />
    <node id="1. Lack of personal motivation: Although Macklin is intrigued by the project and tempted by the possibility of being cured of his migraines, he ultimately declines because he feels that he owes too much to others and cannot take the risk of participating in the experiment.&#10;2. Fear for his well-being: Macklin is aware that his death or incapacitation during the project would not be favorable for the researchers or himself. He values his life and the obligations he has to others more than the potential benefits of the headache cure.&#10;3. Uncertainty about the results: Despite Mitchell's explanation of their discovery, Macklin remains skeptical about how a single injection could cure various types of headaches caused by different factors. This skepticism may contribute to his decision not to participate in the experiment.&#10;4. No direct financial gain: Macklin recognizes that there would be no immediate monetary benefit for him or his family if he undergoes the experiment, as the researchers do not have the resources to offer him a significant incentive.&#10;5. Potential backlash from the scientific community: As a reputable doctor and mathematician, Macklin may be concerned about how participating in an untested and potentially risky medical procedure could impact his professional reputation and standing within the scientific community." />
    <node id=" want you,&quot; Ferris told him.&#10; &#10; Macklin coughed. &quot;I don't want to overestimate my value but the government wouldn't like it very well if I died in the middle of this project. My wife would like it even less.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ferris turned his back on the mathematician. Mitchell could see him mouthing the word yellow .&#10; &#10; &quot;Doctor,&quot; Mitchell said quickly, &quot;I know it's a tremendous favor to ask of a man of your position. But you can understand our problem. Unless we can produce quick, conclusive and dramatic proof of our studies we can get no more financial backing. We should run a large-scale field test. But we haven't the time or money for that. We can cure the headaches of one person and that's the limit of our resources.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm tempted,&quot; Macklin said hesitantly, &quot;but the answer is go. I mean&#10;' no '. I'd like to help you out, but I'm afraid I owe too much to others to take the rest—the risk, I mean.&quot;&#10; &#10; Macklin ran the back of his knuckles across his forehead. &quot;I really would like to take you up on it. When" />
    <node id="1. The first option for dealing with Macklin's current state is to continue with the treatment that Ferris and Mitchell have developed, which involves a virus that controls the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum to stop headaches. However, they acknowledge that they made a miscalculation, causing Macklin to be &quot;as simple as if he had been kicked in the head by a mule.&quot;&#10;2. The second option is to not continue with the treatment and allow Macklin to remain in his current state of lower intelligence. This is difficult to force upon him because Macklin's wife, Mrs. Macklin, strongly opposes the treatment. She would rather have a live husband than a dead genius and prefers him to be stupid.&#10;3. Another complicating factor is that Macklin has a history of vascular spasm and a mild pseudostroke, which puts him at risk for paralysis or even death if the treatment is given without proper medical authorization. Mrs. Macklin argues that no court would give such authority to Ferris and Mitchell.&#10;4. Lastly, Mitchell and Ferris express their inability to undo what they have done to Macklin, which adds to the difficulty of forcing him into being cured. They mention that it might be better to accept the consequences of their actions, including potential legal repercussions, as the Army doesn't like what they have done to him." />
    <node id=" me up more.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But he can't stop me! Not if you want me to do it. Now listen to me—I want you to come right on over here, El.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If you say so,&quot; Macklin said uncertainly." />
    <node id="1. Elliot Macklin's work on devising a faster-than-light drive is significant because it has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and Army recruitment. If completed, this project could enable the Army to reach Pluto and eventually the nearer stars, which would be a major breakthrough in space travel.&#10;2. Macklin's reputation as a renowned mathematician and scientist also plays a crucial role in this process. He is seen as the symbol of the Ideal Scientist by the government, which uses his image to recruit Science and Engineering Cadets. Therefore, his involvement in the project not only advances the scientific aspect of the mission but also serves as a powerful tool for attracting talented individuals to join the Army's ranks.&#10;3. Macklin's health is a potential concern for the completion of the project. The story mentions that he has been working on this project for seven years and that it is nearing completion. However, any disruption or delay in his work due to health issues could impact the timeline and success of the project.&#10;4. The fact that Macklin's severe headaches are a significant factor in his personal life further highlights the importance of his health for the project's outcome. If his headaches were to worsen or become more frequent, it could affect his ability to focus and make progress on the faster-than-light drive.&#10;5. Therefore, finding a solution to Macklin's headaches is not only crucial for his personal well-being but also has implications for the success of the project and the advancement of space exploration." />
    <node id=" who cares if you or I are cured of headaches? Our reputations don't go outside our own fields,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;But now Macklin—&quot;&#10; &#10; Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein in the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word&#10;&quot;mathematician&quot; or even &quot;scientist&quot; was mentioned. No one knew whether his Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been able to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but looked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The government took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the Ideal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.&#10; &#10; For the past seven years Macklin—who was the Advanced Studies Department of Firestone University—had been involved in devising a faster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the nearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knew that the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of Ad astra per aspirin .&#10; &#10; The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.&#10; &#10; Despite" />
    <node id="1. Mrs. Macklin is an attractive brunette in her late thirties, suggesting that she is a middle-aged woman who takes care of her appearance.&#10;2. She is well-dressed, wearing an expensive yellow dress, which indicates her financial stability or social status.&#10;3. Mrs. Macklin has a sharp-cornered jawline, which could be Mitchell's observation of her facial features and might imply that she appears determined or firm in her convictions.&#10;4. She is protective and concerned about her husband, as evidenced by her response to Mitchell and Ferris when they introduced themselves, &quot;You had certainly better help him, gentlemen.&quot; This shows that she cares for her husband's well-being and wants the doctors to assist him if needed.&#10;5. Mrs. Macklin is suspicious of Mitchell and Ferris due to their unauthorized injection of her husband. This implies that she is cautious and attentive, ensuring that her husband receives appropriate medical care.&#10;6. She used to be a nurse, as revealed later in the story, which further explains her ability to recognize the effects of certain drugs and her suspicion towards Mitchell and Ferris' unauthorized injection." />
    <node id="1. Mitchell attempts to reassure Macklin by stating that it would be illegal for him to put Macklin back into his previous state against his wishes, which might make Macklin feel more protected.&#10;2. Mitchell suggests bringing Colonel Carson along, showing openness to external supervision and accountability.&#10;3. However, genuine trust cannot be established solely through words; it requires consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity.&#10;4. Mrs. Macklin decides not to override her husband's wishes for treatment, even when Mitchell suggests getting a court order. This reinforces the idea that external pressure may not ensure Macklin's well-being.&#10;5. It is ultimately up to Macklin himself to decide whether he trusts Mitchell and feels assured of his intentions." />
    <node id="1. The man, identified as Dr. Macklin, experienced a significant decrease in intellectual abilities after being treated by Mitchell and Ferris. He was classified as a &quot;moron&quot; based on standard intelligence tests, indicating significantly below-average intelligence. This is a stark contrast to his previous state, where he was described as a mathematical genius. The change is attributed to the F-M Virus, which Mitchell and Ferris used to cure Dr. Macklin's headaches, but it appears they miscalculated the dosage, resulting in overcontrol of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum, affecting his cognitive abilities." />
    <node id="1. Continue with the treatment: The first option is to proceed with the treatment developed by Ferris and Mitchell, which involves using a virus to control the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum to stop headaches. However, they acknowledge that their miscalculation resulted in Macklin's current state of lower intelligence. This option may be difficult to enforce, as Macklin's wife opposes it and he has expressed contentment with his current condition.&#10;&#10;2. Allow Macklin to remain in his current state: The second option is to let Macklin stay in his current state of lower intelligence. This is challenging to impose due to Mrs. Macklin's strong opposition and her preference for having a live husband over a dead genius. Additionally, Macklin has a history of vascular spasm and mild pseudostroke, putting him at risk for paralysis or even death if the treatment is administered without proper medical authorization.&#10;&#10;3. Inability to undo the treatment: Mitchell and Ferris have admitted that they cannot reverse what they have done to Macklin, making it difficult to force him into being cured. They are willing to accept the consequences of their actions, including potential legal repercussions, as the Army doesn't approve of what they have done to him.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Macklin's role: Mrs. Macklin opposes the treatment and would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. She prefers her husband to be stupid and has the power to influence his decisions. Colonel Carson and Mitchell consider finding her to discuss the situation, as she may be able to persuade Macklin to accept the treatment. However, Mrs. Macklin decides not to override her husband's wishes for treatment, even when Mitchell suggests getting a court order. This reinforces the idea that external pressure may not ensure Macklin's well-being and that it is ultimately up to him to decide whether he trusts Mitchell and feels assured of his intentions." />
    <node id=" things. It's peaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife and all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?&quot;&#10; &#10; Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him,&quot; Mitchell said.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's not his decision to make,&quot; the colonel said. &quot;He's an idiot now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron. He seems an idiot compared to his former level of intelligence but he's legally responsible. There are millions of morons running around loose in the United States. They can get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of them do. You can't force him into being cured.... At least, I don't think you can.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, I can't. This is hardly a totalitarian state.&quot; The colonel looked momentarily glum that it wasn't.&#10; &#10; Mitchell looked back at Macklin. &quot;Where did his wife get to, Colonel? I don't think that even previously he made too many personal decisions for himself. Perhaps she could influence him.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="1. The significant change in the individual examined by the Army physician is that he has experienced a dramatic decrease in intellectual abilities. Previously classified as a mathematical genius, he is now considered a &quot;moron&quot; based on standard intelligence tests, which indicates significantly below-average intelligence. This drastic change is attributed to the F-M Virus, which Mitchell and Ferris used to cure his headaches but miscalculated the dosage, resulting in overcontrol of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum, affecting his cognitive abilities." />
    <node id="1. By bringing Colonel Carson along, Macklin might feel more assured because an authority figure from the Army will be present during the visit to Mitchell's laboratory. This external supervision can help ensure that Mitchell maintains ethical behavior and doesn't attempt to take advantage of the situation.&#10;2. Colonel Carson, as a representative of the Army, is likely interested in Macklin's well-being since he is under their surveillance. Therefore, having him accompany Macklin provides an added layer of protection, making it less likely that Mitchell would try to exploit the situation.&#10;3. Additionally, by allowing Macklin to bring Colonel Carson along and not objecting to his presence, Mitchell demonstrates a level of transparency and respect for Macklin's concerns. This action can further contribute to building trust between the two parties.&#10;4. However, it is essential to note that genuine trust cannot be solely based on external supervision or someone else's presence; it requires consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity. While bringing Colonel Carson might help Macklin feel more confident initially, ongoing trust would need to be earned through Mitchell's conduct throughout the process." />

This pressure effect on the brain is what produces headaches. The scientists have developed a virus that feeds on pituitrin, a substance responsible for the over-production of the pituitary gland. By artificially breeding this virus, they aim to cure headaches by localizing and stabilizing a colony of the virus in the brain cells, which will relax the cerebral vessels and prevent excessive pressure within the brain cavities. This one simple injection could potentially eradicate headaches forever.">

Ferris thinks Macklin might be trying to get them in trouble because he suspects Macklin is aware of the consequences of their actions and may be attempting to cause difficulties for Mitchell and Ferris in terms of their reputations and careers. This suspicion arises when Macklin appears much simpler than usual, leading Ferris to believe that Macklin might be pretending or exaggerating his condition to create problems for them.">

Lastly, Mitchell and Ferris express their inability to undo what they have done to Macklin, which adds to the difficulty of forcing him into being cured.

The first option for dealing with Macklin's current state is to continue with the treatment that Ferris and Mitchell have developed, which involves a virus that controls the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum to stop headaches. However, they acknowledge that they made a miscalculation, causing Macklin to be &quot;as simple as if he had been kicked in the head by a mule.&quot;&#10;2. The second option is to not continue with the treatment and allow Macklin to remain in his current state of lower intelligence. This is difficult to force upon him because Macklin's wife, Mrs. Macklin, strongly opposes the treatment. She would rather have a live husband than a dead genius and prefers him to be stupid.&#10;3. Another complicating factor is that Macklin has a history of vascular spasm and a mild pseudostroke, which puts him at risk for paralysis or even death if the treatment is given without proper medical authorization. Mrs. Macklin argues that no court would give such authority to Ferris and Mitchell.&#10;4. Lastly, Mitchell and Ferris express their inability to undo what they have done to Macklin, which adds to the difficulty of forcing him into being cured. They mention that it might be better to accept the consequences of their actions, including potential legal repercussions, as the Army doesn't like what they have done to him.">

Elliot Macklin's work on devising a faster-than-light drive is significant because it has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and Army recruitment. If completed, this project could enable the Army to reach Pluto and eventually the nearer stars, which would be a major breakthrough in space travel.&#10;2. Macklin's reputation as a renowned mathematician and scientist also plays a crucial role in this process. He is seen as the symbol of the Ideal Scientist by the government, which uses his image to recruit Science and Engineering Cadets. Therefore, his involvement in the project not only advances the scientific aspect of the mission but also serves as a powerful tool for attracting talented individuals to join the Army's ranks.&#10;3.

However, any disruption or delay in his work due to health issues could impact the timeline and success of the project.&#10;4. The fact that Macklin's severe headaches are a significant factor in his personal life further highlights the importance of his health for the project's outcome. If his headaches were to worsen or become more frequent, it could affect his ability to focus and make progress on the faster-than-light drive.&#10;5.

He also expresses concern about being put back in his original state against his wishes, which Mitchell assures him would be illegal.&#10;2. The mathematician might be willing to take on some level of risk or uncertainty if it means getting rid of his severe headaches, as they significantly affect his quality of life. However, he is also cautious and wants to ensure that his autonomy is respected in the process. He values his current state of peace and financial security, which might make him more reluctant to undergo any procedure that could potentially disrupt these aspects of his life.">

This option may be difficult to enforce, as Macklin's wife opposes it and he has expressed contentment with his current condition.&#10;&#10;2. Allow Macklin to remain in his current state: The second option is to let Macklin stay in his current state of lower intelligence. This is challenging to impose due to Mrs. Macklin's strong opposition and her preference for having a live husband over a dead genius. Additionally, Macklin has a history of vascular spasm and mild pseudostroke, putting him at risk for paralysis or even death if the treatment is administered without proper medical authorization.&#10;&#10;3. Inability to undo the treatment: Mitchell and Ferris have admitted that they cannot reverse what they have done to Macklin, making it difficult to force him into being cured. They are willing to accept the consequences of their actions, including potential legal repercussions, as the Army doesn't approve of what they have done to him.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Macklin's role: Mrs. Macklin opposes the treatment and would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. She prefers her husband to be stupid and has the power to influence his decisions. Colonel Carson and Mitchell consider finding her to discuss the situation, as she may be able to persuade Macklin to accept the treatment. However, Mrs. Macklin decides not to override her husband's wishes for treatment, even when Mitchell suggests getting a court order. This reinforces the idea that external pressure may not ensure Macklin's well-being and that it is ultimately up to him to decide whether he trusts Mitchell and feels assured of his intentions.">

Lack of personal motivation: Although Macklin is intrigued by the project and tempted by the possibility of being cured of his migraines, he ultimately declines because he feels that he owes too much to others and cannot take the risk of participating in the experiment.&#10;2. Fear for his well-being: Macklin is aware that his death or incapacitation during the project would not be favorable for the researchers or himself. He values his life and the obligations he has to others more than the potential benefits of the headache cure.&#10;3. Uncertainty about the results: Despite Mitchell's explanation of their discovery, Macklin remains skeptical about how a single injection could cure various types of headaches caused by different factors. This skepticism may contribute to his decision not to participate in the experiment.&#10;4. No direct financial gain: Macklin recognizes that there would be no immediate monetary benefit for him or his family if he undergoes the experiment, as the researchers do not have the resources to offer him a significant incentive.&#10;5. Potential backlash from the scientific community: As a reputable doctor and mathematician, Macklin may be concerned about how participating in an untested and potentially risky medical procedure could impact his professional reputation and standing within the scientific community.">

First, Mitchell makes it clear that he is abiding by the law and respecting Macklin's autonomy by stating that he cannot put Macklin back into his previous state against his wishes, as it would be illegal. This implies that Mitchell is trustworthy and reliable.&#10;&#10;Second, when Macklin expresses concern about being closely watched by the Army, Mitchell suggests bringing Colonel Carson along. This shows that Mitchell is open to external supervision and accountability, which can help put Macklin at ease.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that genuine trust and assurance cannot be fully achieved through words alone; they require consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity. While Mitchell's words may provide some reassurance, Macklin would likely need to see evidence of Mitchell's trustworthiness over time in order to truly feel assured.&#10;&#10;In the case of Colonel Carson accompanying Macklin to the laboratory, it is unlikely that this would have a significant impact on whether or not Macklin feels manipulated or forced into his previous state. This is because the decision ultimately rests with Macklin and his own autonomy, rather than being dependent on the presence of Colonel Carson. Ultimately, Macklin would need to feel comfortable and confident in his own decision to seek help from Mitchell, regardless of any external factors.">

The first option for dealing with Macklin's current state is to continue with the treatment that Ferris and Mitchell have developed, which involves a virus that controls the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum to stop headaches. However, they acknowledge that they made a miscalculation, causing Macklin to be &quot;as simple as if he had been kicked in the head by a mule.&quot;&#10;2. The second option is to not continue with the treatment and allow Macklin to remain in his current state of lower intelligence. This is difficult to force upon him because Macklin's wife, Mrs. Macklin, strongly opposes the treatment. She would rather have a live husband than a dead genius and prefers him to be stupid.&#10;3. Another complicating factor is that Macklin has a history of vascular spasm and a mild pseudostroke, which puts him at risk for paralysis or even death if the treatment is given without proper medical authorization. Mrs. Macklin argues that no court would give such authority to Ferris and Mitchell.&#10;4. Lastly, Mitchell and Ferris express their inability to undo what they have done to Macklin, which adds to the difficulty of forcing him into being cured. They mention that it might be better to accept the consequences of their actions, including potential legal repercussions, as the Army doesn't like what they have done to him.">

This implies that Mitchell is trustworthy and reliable.&#10;&#10;Second, when Macklin expresses concern about being closely watched by the Army, Mitchell suggests bringing Colonel Carson along. This shows that Mitchell is open to external supervision and accountability, which can help put Macklin at ease.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that genuine trust and assurance cannot be fully achieved through words alone; they require consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity. While Mitchell's words may provide some reassurance, Macklin would likely need to see evidence of Mitchell's trustworthiness over time in order to truly feel assured.&#10;&#10;In the case of Colonel Carson accompanying Macklin to the laboratory, it is unlikely that this would have a significant impact on whether or not Macklin feels manipulated or forced into his previous state.

This option may be difficult to enforce, as Macklin's wife opposes it and he has expressed contentment with his current condition.&#10;&#10;2. Allow Macklin to remain in his current state: The second option is to let Macklin stay in his current state of lower intelligence. This is challenging to impose due to Mrs. Macklin's strong opposition and her preference for having a live husband over a dead genius. Additionally, Macklin has a history of vascular spasm and mild pseudostroke, putting him at risk for paralysis or even death if the treatment is administered without proper medical authorization.&#10;&#10;3. Inability to undo the treatment: Mitchell and Ferris have admitted that they cannot reverse what they have done to Macklin, making it difficult to force him into being cured. They are willing to accept the consequences of their actions, including potential legal repercussions, as the Army doesn't approve of what they have done to him.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Macklin's role: Mrs. Macklin opposes the treatment and would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. She prefers her husband to be stupid and has the power to influence his decisions. Colonel Carson and Mitchell consider finding her to discuss the situation, as she may be able to persuade Macklin to accept the treatment. However, Mrs. Macklin decides not to override her husband's wishes for treatment, even when Mitchell suggests getting a court order. This reinforces the idea that external pressure may not ensure Macklin's well-being and that it is ultimately up to him to decide whether he trusts Mitchell and feels assured of his intentions.">

By bringing Colonel Carson along, Macklin might feel more assured because an authority figure from the Army will be present during the visit to Mitchell's laboratory. This external supervision can help ensure that Mitchell maintains ethical behavior and doesn't attempt to take advantage of the situation.&#10;2. Colonel Carson, as a representative of the Army, is likely interested in Macklin's well-being since he is under their surveillance. Therefore, having him accompany Macklin provides an added layer of protection, making it less likely that Mitchell would try to exploit the situation.&#10;3. Additionally, by allowing Macklin to bring Colonel Carson along and not objecting to his presence, Mitchell demonstrates a level of transparency and respect for Macklin's concerns. This action can further contribute to building trust between the two parties.&#10;4. However, it is essential to note that genuine trust cannot be solely based on external supervision or someone else's presence; it requires consistent actions and a proven track record of respect and integrity.

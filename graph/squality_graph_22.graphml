    <node id="Orison is communicating with a monitor from the Department of Treasury, referred to as Monitor J-12. They communicate through a device in Orison's pillow that is only active during report times. The purpose of their daily rendezvous is for Orison to report on her activities and experiences at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company, where she has recently started working." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;That's classified information,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Please speak directly to your pillow, Miss McCall.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison lay down cautiously. &quot;All right,&quot; she whispered to her pillow.&#10; &#10; &quot;Over here,&quot; the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow beside her.&#10; &#10; Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. &quot;A radio?&quot; she asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Of a sort,&quot; Monitor J-12 agreed. &quot;We have to maintain communications security. Have you anything to report?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I got the job,&quot; Orison said. &quot;Are you ... in that pillow ... all the time?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, Miss McCall,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Only at report times. Shall we establish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time, every day?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You make it sound so improper,&quot; Orison said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,&quot; the monitor said.&#10;&quot;Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a microphone," />

Perhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs had her phone tapped.&#10; &#10; &quot;Testing,&quot; a baritone voice muttered.&#10; &#10; Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. &quot;Beg pardon?&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Testing,&quot; the male voice repeated. &quot;One, two, three; three, two, one. Do you read me? Over.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax, she reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.&#10; &#10; The room was empty.&#10; &#10; &quot;Testing,&quot; the voice repeated.&#10; &#10; &quot;What you're testing,&quot; Orison said in a firm voice, &quot;is my patience.

    <node id=" tell me what happened at the bank today.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a microphone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. &quot;That's about it, so far,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good report,&quot; J-12 said from the pillow. &quot;Sounds like you've dropped into a real snakepit, beautiful.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?&quot; Orison asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Native optimism,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Good night.&quot; J-12 signed off with a peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she placed the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.&#10; &#10; Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved to write Washington for permission to make her future reports by registered mail.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current Wall Street Journal , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair of leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together was bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not wearing" />
    <node id=" mid-air.&#10;&quot;They're so very strange,&quot; Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she thought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling life. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands." />
    <node id="ison thought, reading a nonsense story into a microphone for an invisible audience.&#10; &#10; Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the book and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was a new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming down from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with briefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these gentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped aboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his heart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment of their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny into this curiousest of banks.&#10; &#10; Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude. Girls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together, eyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and favored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed, finished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her lonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished" />
    <node id=" She'd best get going. The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her off the upstairs floors.&#10; &#10; But the building had a stairway.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to seven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and the landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There was a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the fringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.&#10; &#10; She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.&#10; &#10; Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room extended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut, its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were galvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs. Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred and eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by strands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with pink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and" />
    <node id="1. Orison is afraid and disgusted by the discovery of millions of tiny spiders because she has arachnophobia, which is a strong fear or dislike of spiders. The sight of so many spiders in the tanks, along with their movement and the bubbling green fluid they were in, triggered her phobia and caused her to scream and struggle to get away." />
    <node id="s were laced together by strands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with pink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half full of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment Orison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the liquid. Then she screamed.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from the spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions upon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling, leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison put her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the stairway door.&#10; &#10; Into a pair of arms.&#10; &#10; &quot;I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,&quot; Kraft Gerding said. Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have her wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder Gerding. &quot;It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,&quot; he said. &quot;Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were we to" />
    <node id="ink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked one of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. &quot;This is no spider, Orison,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped in the palm of his hand. &quot;These are Microfabridae, more nearly related to shellfish than to spiders,&quot; he said. &quot;They're stone-and-metal eaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.&quot; He extended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature, flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around the bowl of his hand. &quot;Pretty little fellow, isn't he?&quot; Dink asked.&#10;&quot;Here. You hold him.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd rather not,&quot; she protested.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd be happier if you did,&quot; Dink said.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Orison extended her hand as into a furnace. Dink brushed the Microfabridus from his palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like a legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and unfolded it, to" />
    <node id=" back on. All right, now?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; she said, still trembling. &quot;They were going to throw me to the spiders.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Kraft told you that?&quot; Dink Gerding released her and turned to the kneeling man. &quot;Stand up, Elder Brother.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I....&quot;&#10; &#10; Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft's jaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.&#10; &#10; &quot;If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt to recover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.&quot; Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dink through half-closed eyes. &quot;No? Then get out of here, all of you. Samma! &quot;&#10; &#10; Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, with the merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison,&quot; Dink said. &quot;Why did you do it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you read the story of Bluebeard?&quot; Orison asked." />
    <node id=" Dink!&quot; Orison shouted.&#10; &#10; &quot;My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of damsels in distress,&quot; Kraft said. &quot;Someone, after all, has to mind the bank.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I came to bring a message to Dink,&quot; Orison said. &quot;Let me go, you acromegalic apes!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The message?&quot; Kraft Gerding demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Something about escudo green. Put me down!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Suddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as though struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their faces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly lowering himself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Without questions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms around Orison.&#10; &#10; &quot;They can't harm you,&quot; he said. She turned to press her face against his chest. &quot;You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn your brain back on. All right, now?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; she said, still trembling. &quot;They were going to throw me to the spiders.&quot;" />
    <node id=" &quot;It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,&quot; he said. &quot;Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were we to toss you into one of these tanks....&quot; Orison struggled against her two sumo -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by some quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the floor. &quot;... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted all around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of course, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of calcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within minutes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,&quot; one of the earmuffed sumo -wrestlers protested.&#10; &#10; &quot;Elder Compassion has no rank,&quot; Kraft Gerding said. &quot;Miss McCall, you must tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Dink ... Dink!&quot; Orison shouted.&#10; &#10; &quot;My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of damsels in distress,&quot; Kraft said. &quot;" />
    <node id="The new person who introduced himself as Kraft Gerding is the elder brother of Dink Gerding, the president of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. Kraft Gerding visited Orison McCall, who works at the bank, to welcome her to the bank's family and to warn her about his brother. He mentioned that he had heard that Dink had been talking to Orison and told her to be careful not to mix business with pleasure. However, Orison misunderstood his intentions and quit her job in anger. Kraft Gerding then tried to apologize and explain that his only wish was to serve and protect her, but Orison insisted that he leave. It is unclear whether Kraft Gerding has any official role at the bank or if he was merely visiting his brother." />
    <node id=" disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba motion.&#10; &#10; The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male, stepped off. &quot;Good morning, Mr. Gerding,&quot; Miss Vingt said, bowing.&#10; &#10; &quot;Carry on, Colonel,&quot; the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed, he stepped up to Orison's desk. &quot;Good morning. Miss McCall,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What is this?&quot; Orison demanded. &quot;Visiting-day at the zoo?&quot; She paused and shook her head. &quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;It's just that ... Vingt thing....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Auga is rather intense,&quot; the new Mr. Gerding said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah, intense,&quot; Orison said. &quot;Like a kidney-stone.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company family, Miss McCall,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm Kraft Gerding, Dink's elder brother.

And she saw with some gratification that he was not wearing earmuffs. &quot;My name,&quot; the stranger said, &quot;is Dink Gerding. I am President of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our little family.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm Orison McCall,&quot; she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight? So tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three? Maybe higher heels?&#10; &#10; &quot;We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,&quot; Dink Gerding said. He took the chair to the right of her desk.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's nothing,&quot; Orison said, switching off the microphone.&#10; &#10; &quot;On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any reasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,&quot; Orison said.&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll be reading silently before long,&quot; Mr. Gerding said.

    <node id=" I understand you've met Dink already.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped even closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch of frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The head, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's spike-topped Pickelhauben ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed normal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed—what continental manners these bankers had!—and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up paper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and said, &quot;I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you, Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing business with pleasure.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. &quot;I quit!&quot; she shouted. &quot;You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I care.

    <node id="asket. &quot;I quit!&quot; she shouted. &quot;You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I care. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in finance, and listen to another word.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,&quot; Kraft Gerding said, bowing again, a bit lower. &quot;Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most charming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end, dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to the wise....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; N'est-ce pas? &quot; Orison said. &quot;Well, Buster, here's a word to the foolish. Get lost.&quot;&#10; &#10; Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. &quot;Until we meet again?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll hold my breath,&quot; Orison promised. &quot;The elevator is just behind you. Push a button, will you? And bon voyage .&quot;&#10; &#10; Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with a cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above fifth floor.&#10; &#10; First the unspeakable" />
    <node id=" &#10; &quot;You'll be reading silently before long,&quot; Mr. Gerding said. He smiled, as though this explained everything. &quot;By the way, your official designation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're to keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here and dictate it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Please do,&quot; Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and presence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?&quot; Mr. Gerding asked, as though following her train of thought.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Though I've been associated with a rather large financial organization.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used to them,&quot; he said. &quot;Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense with calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy your using it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Dink?&quot; she asked. &quot;And I suppose you're to call me Orison?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's the drill,&quot; he said. &quot;One more question" />
    <node id="The confident and opulent woman who praises Orison's reading abilities, compares her entrance to pouncing, and has a physical build reminiscent of a burlesque queen is Dink Gerding, the new president of the bank. This becomes clear later in the story when Orison reflects on their earlier interaction and realizes that Dink Gerding is a man. The text states, &quot;A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight? So tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three? Maybe higher heels?&quot; This reveals that Dink Gerding is the person who identifies as a man, and Orison has mistakenly assumed to be a woman due to her opulent appearance and flirtatious demeanor." />
    <node id=" shoulders stayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome, to the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink, saw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but not their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them. Small bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Orison finished the Wall Street Journal by early afternoon. A page came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of yesterday's Congressional Record . She launched into the Record , thinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome madman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. &quot;You read so well , darling,&quot; someone said across the desk.&#10; &#10; Orison looked up. &quot;Oh, hello,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn't hear you come up.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I walk ever so lightly,&quot; the woman said, standing hip-shot in front of the desk, &quot;and pounce ever so hard.&quot; She smiled. Opulent, Orison thought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought" />
    <node id="Mr. Wanji explains to Orison that her job at the Taft Bank will involve reading newspapers and other materials into a microphone. The specific location she will be working in is a small office on the fifth floor, which is accessible to her between the street floor and the fifth floor. She is told that basements and floors above the fifth floor are off-limits to her. Mr. Wanji also mentions that Orison's role will primarily involve reading from the newspaper placed in the &quot;In&quot; basket and waiting for new materials to read when she finishes. The purpose of this task is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be related to her role as a secretary at the bank. It is unclear whether this job is intended to familiarize her with the bank's operations or if there are other purposes behind it." />
    <node id=" &quot;It seems a rather peculiar job,&quot; Orison said. &quot;After all, I'm a secretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me with the Bank's operation?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't bug me, kid,&quot; Mr. Wanji said. &quot;All you gotta do is read that there paper into this here microphone. Can do?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Orison said. &quot;While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to ask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union, coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take care of these details now? Or would you—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems best to you, kid,&quot; Mr. Wanji said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's might explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's secretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall, girl Government spy.

She picked up the newspaper from the &quot;In&quot; basket, unfolded it to discover the day's Wall Street Journal , and began at the top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk, nodding his head as he listened. &quot;You blowing real good, kid,&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;The boss is gonna dig you the most.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the one into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then took off upstairs in the elevator.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; By lunchtime Orison had finished the Wall Street Journal and had begun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a fantastic novel of some sort, named The Hobbit . Reading this peculiar fare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than ever that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her, the front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a Federal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a microphone for an invisible audience.&#10; &#10; Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the" />

It was indeed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Crazy!&quot; Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it with athletic vigor. &quot;You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell you, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around this tomb, girlwise.&quot; He took her arm and led her toward the bank of elevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly to Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal than Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. &quot;Lift us to five, Mac,&quot; Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,&#10;&quot;You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor and floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron Curtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?&quot;" />
    <node id=" between the street floor and floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron Curtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs, now that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.&#10; &#10; The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to hold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and a microphone. Beside them was a double-decked &quot;In&quot; and &quot;Out&quot; basket.&#10;&quot;Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,&quot; Mr. Wanji said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?&quot; Orison asked.&#10; &#10; The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the &quot;In&quot; basket.&#10;&quot;Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,&quot; he said. &quot;When you get done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to read.

I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see him, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.&quot; Orison clicked the phone down. What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language Mr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by tonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle it out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk, she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could only fire her.&#10; &#10; Orison folded the paper and put it in the &quot;Out&quot; basket. Someone would be here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going. The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her off the upstairs floors.&#10; &#10; But the building had" />
    <node id="The new person who introduced himself as Kraft Gerding is Dink Gerding's elder brother. He visited Orison McCall at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company to welcome her to the bank's family and warn her about his brother. He mentioned that he had heard that Dink had been talking to Orison and told her to be careful not to mix business with pleasure, as he did not want her to misunderstand Dink's intentions. However, Orison misunderstood Kraft's intentions and quit her job in anger. Kraft then tried to apologize and explain his only wish was to serve and protect her, but Orison insisted that he leave. It is unclear whether Kraft Gerding has any official role at the bank or if he was merely visiting his brother." />
    <node id="The baritone-voiced person contacting Orison McCall is Monitor J-12 from the Department of Treasury. They communicate with Orison through a device in her pillow, which is only active during report times. The purpose of their communication is for Orison to report on her activities and experiences at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company, where she has recently started working as part of her job for the Department of Treasury." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;ancient song&quot; that the Microfabridae have been singing for a million years is a metaphor for their natural behavior or biological process, which has been going on for a long time. It could represent their mating call, feeding response, or communication method.&#10;2. The Microfabridae are attracted to the sand that Orison throws into their tank because it contains gold, and they are drawn to gold through a chemical tropism, similar to how children are attracted to candy. Gold could be essential for their survival, reproduction, or other vital functions. Dink also mentioned that the Microfabridae are used in a commercial process his company is developing, so the gold in the sand might be related to this process." />
    <node id=" leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to the music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness, storm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace and harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.&#10;&quot;It's an ancient song,&quot; Dink said. &quot;The Microfabridae have been singing it for a million years.&quot; He released her, and opened a wood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.&#10;&quot;Hold out your hands,&quot; he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.&#10;&quot;Throw our singers some supper for their song,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the mineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the liquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.&#10;&quot;They're so very strange,&quot; Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she thought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking" />

We'd better get you down where you belong.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest tank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring. It was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. &quot;Strange, using crawdads in a bank,&quot; she said. She stood silent for a moment. &quot;I thought I heard music,&quot; she said. &quot;I heard it when I came in. Something like the sighing of wind in winter trees.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,&quot; Dink said. &quot;They all sing together while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.&quot; He took her arm. &quot;If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these little workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.&quot;&#10; &#10; Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to the music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness, storm and danger were its theme" />
    <node id=" palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like a legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and unfolded it, to hold it over Orison's palm.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's like a baby crawdad,&quot; Orison said.&#10; &#10; &quot;A sort of crustacean,&quot; Dink agreed. &quot;We use them in a commercial process we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off and secret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What do they do?&quot; Orison asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's still a secret,&quot; Dink said, smiling. &quot;I can't tell even you that, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's he doing now?&quot; Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus, perched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching against her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.&#10; &#10; &quot;They like gold,&quot; Dink explained, peering across her shoulder, comfortably close. &quot;They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as children are attracted to candy. Toss him back" />
    <node id="Mr. Wanji explains to Orison that her job at the Taft Bank will involve reading newspapers and other materials into a microphone. The specific location she will be working in is a small office on the fifth floor, which is accessible to her between the street floor and the fifth floor. She is told that basements and floors above the fifth floor are off-limits to her. He mentions that Orison's role will primarily involve reading from the newspaper placed in the &quot;In&quot; basket and waiting for new materials to read when she finishes. The purpose of this task is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be related to her role as a secretary at the bank. There are no other restrictions mentioned except the accessibility to certain floors." />
    <node id="1. Dink Gerding intervened and stopped his brother Kraft from harming Orison because he saw that Kraft had hit her and she was trembling on the floor. He told Kraft to stand up and attempted to restore order by asserting his authority as president of the bank.&#10;2. Dink may have thought of the story of Bluebeard in response to Orison's question about why he came up because the story involves a powerful man who warns a woman against his own brother, just as Kraft had done. In the story, Bluebeard is revealed to be a serial killer and his brother eventually helps the woman escape from him. By comparing Kraft to Bluebeard, Dink suggests that his brother may have malicious intentions towards Orison. The story of Bluebeard involves a character named Bluebeard who marries several women and then murders them. When his latest wife discovers the bodies of her predecessors, she is initially terrified but eventually rescued by her brothers." />
    <node id="In the story, Orison communicates with Monitor J-12 through a device in her pillow that is only active during report times. During their first conversation, Orison reports to Monitor J-12 that she has gotten the job at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. She also asks the monitor if they are always in the pillow, to which Monitor J-12 responds that they are only there during report times.&#10;&#10;Later in the story, Orison is interrupted while reading page four of the current Wall Street Journal by Mr. Wanji, who turns out to be her supervisor at the bank. She starts reading the newspaper into a microphone as part of her job. At the end of her workday, Orison reports back to Monitor J-12 through her pillow about the Earmuffs, her task of reading to a microphone, and the generally mimsy tone of the bank. In response, Monitor J-12 tells Orison that it sounds like she has dropped into a real snakepit but also compliments her by calling her &quot;beautiful.&quot;" />
    <node id="The purpose of having Orison read the newspaper aloud into a microphone is not explicitly stated in the story, but it seems to be related to her role as a secretary at the bank. It may be that her reading is being recorded for transcription or archival purposes, or it could be part of a broader information-gathering or monitoring effort.&#10;&#10;Orison was chosen for this task despite wanting to discuss other work-related details with Mr. Wanji because the Taft Bank has a laissez-faire policy when it comes to handling administrative and logistical matters. Mr. Wanji, her supervisor, tells Orison to take care of such details in whatever way seems best to her, indicating that he does not consider these matters to be his responsibility.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, as a secretary at the bank, Orison's role is likely to involve tasks that are administrative or supportive in nature. Reading the newspaper aloud into a microphone could be one such task that has been assigned to her. The fact that she was chosen for this task may also suggest that Mr. Wanji or other senior staff members at the bank consider her to be capable, reliable, and trustworthy.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the specific purpose of Orison's task is not entirely clear, it seems likely that she has been assigned this role as part of her broader duties as a secretary at the Taft Bank. The laissez-faire management style of the bank may have also played a role in her selection for this particular task." />
    <node id="1. Orison decides to quit her job after meeting Kraft Gerding because she misunderstands his intentions when he warns her about mixing business with pleasure. She interprets it as a threat to her job security, and in the heat of the moment, she quits.&#10;2. Kraft Gerding's warning to Orison is that she should be careful not to mix business with pleasure, specifically in reference to his younger brother Dink Gerding, who is also an executive at the bank where Orison works. He does not want her to misunderstand Dink's intentions or get the wrong idea if they socialize outside of work." />
    <node id="1. Miss McCall was in the spider room because she had come to bring a message to Dink Gerding at the bank. She was not expecting to find a room filled with spiders and panicked when she saw them. Kraft Gerding then threatened to toss her to the spiders if she did not tell him what she was doing there.&#10;2. Kraft Gerding mentions that Elder Compassion, who opposed harming Miss McCall, holds no rank to assert his dominance over him and make it clear that he makes the decisions. This shows the power dynamic between the two characters and also emphasizes that Kraft Gerding is not afraid to go against Elder Compassion's wishes if it suits his needs. In this case, Kraft Gerding threatens to harm Miss McCall despite Elder Compassion's objections." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Orison discovering the room filled with tanks on the seventh floor is not explicitly stated in the text. However, it is mentioned that the room is extended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut, and its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. The tanks are connected by delicate white lattices, and they are filled with a greenish fluid containing millions of tiny spiders. It seems that this room and the discovery of the spiders are meant to further illustrate the unusual and potentially sinister activities taking place within the building where Orison works. The exact purpose or significance of this discovery is left open to interpretation." />
    <node id="1. When Orison disobeyed instructions and looked inside the secret room, she found tiny pink creatures that resembled spiders, which were contained in tanks filled with bubbling green fluid. These creatures were actually Microfabridae, a type of organism related to shellfish and not true spiders.&#10;&#10;2. Dink's discovery was no cause for Orison's arachnophobia because Microfabridae are not spiders, but rather more closely related to shellfish. They are harmless and couldn't hurt a fly, let alone pose a threat to a human being. Additionally, they are attracted to gold, which is why one of them was scratching at Orison's high-school class ring." />
    <node id=", Orison,&quot; Dink said. &quot;Why did you do it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you read the story of Bluebeard?&quot; Orison asked. She stood close to Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. &quot;I had to see what it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was forbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for you, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you that the escudo green is pale.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless,&quot; Dink said. &quot;Now, what is this thing you have about spiders?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've always been terrified of them,&quot; Orison said. &quot;When I was a little girl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a spider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came home and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetite for supper.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Strange,&quot; Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked one of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. &quot;This is no spider, Or" />
    <node id="Orison, who has arachnophobia or a strong fear of spiders, is frightened and disgusted when she discovers millions of tiny spiders while scuba diving in a tank on the seventh floor of the building where she works. She sees what she thinks is Ben Franklin winking at her through the bubbling life, but she dismisses this as nonsense and tries to brush it off. Her reaction is triggered by the sight of so many spiders, their movement, and the green fluid they are in, which together evoke her fear of spiders and cause her to scream and struggle to get away." />
    <node id="1. To record or transcribe the news for internal or archival purposes.&#10;2. As part of a broader information-gathering or monitoring effort.&#10;3. Due to the laissez-faire management style, Orison was given this task as part of her administrative and supportive role at the bank.&#10;4. To familiarize herself with the bank's operations or other purposes related to her secretary role.&#10;5. The task may serve as a test for Orison, evaluating her adaptability, reliability, and trustworthiness in handling unconventional tasks." />
    <node id="1. The entity communicating with Orison through the pillow is Monitor J-12 from the Department of Treasury. They use this method to maintain communications security by using a device that is only active during report times, making it difficult to trace or intercept their communication.&#10;2. This method allows them to communicate with Orison without physically being present and also ensures that their communication remains secure and confidential. By speaking through the pillow, Monitor J-12 can ensure that their communication with Orison remains covert and unnoticed by others." />
    <node id="1. The person who addressed Orison after startling her is Monitor J-12 from the Department of Treasury. They communicate with Orison through a device in her pillow, which is only active during report times.&#10;2. The purpose of their call is for Orison to report on her activities and experiences at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company, where she has recently started working as part of her job for the Department of Treasury. Monitor J-12's initial surprise and concern for Orison could be interpreted as them checking in on her well-being before proceeding with their usual report time conversation." />
    <node id="1. Dink Gerding is introducing Microfabridae to Orison, which he calls &quot;tiny pink creatures&quot; that resemble spiders. However, they are not true spiders but are more closely related to shellfish.&#10;2. Based on Dink's description, the key characteristics of Microfabridae are:&#10;* They have a flesh-colored body that makes them nearly invisible against human skin.&#10;* They are hard and crisp, like a legged grain of sand.&#10;* They are attracted to gold, as one of them was scratching at Orison's high-school class ring.&#10;* They could not harm a fly or any other creature, as they eat only stone and metal.&#10;* They are small in size and move around quickly, scuttling in the bowl of Dink's hand." />
    <node id="Based on the conversation and Orison's observations of the person he is interacting with, who is later revealed to be Dink Gerding, the new president of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company, we can infer a few things about Orison.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Orison appears to be new to the bank and is still getting used to the environment and culture there. This is evident when she describes the bank as having a &quot;mimsy tone,&quot; which suggests that she finds it somewhat stifling or suffocating. She also mentions her task of reading to a microphone, which could be related to her job for the Department of Treasury.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Orison is perceptive and observant. She notices Dink Gerding's military-like posture and confident demeanor, as well as his European manners. These observations suggest that she has some experience with military culture or etiquette, which reinforces the idea that she may have a military background herself.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, Orison is open-minded and adaptable. Despite initially assuming that Dink Gerding is a woman based on her opulent appearance and flirtatious demeanor, she quickly adjusts her assumptions when she realizes her mistake. This suggests that she is comfortable with ambiguity and able to adapt to new situations and information.&#10;&#10;Overall, while we don't learn much about Orison's personal background or qualities outside of his conversation with Dink Gerding, we can infer that he is perceptive, observant, open-minded, and possibly has some military experience." />
    <node id="?&quot; she asked. &quot;And I suppose you're to call me Orison?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's the drill,&quot; he said. &quot;One more question, Orison. Dinner this evening?&quot;&#10; &#10; Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and still so young. &quot;We've hardly met,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;But we're on a first-name basis already,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;Dance?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd love to,&quot; Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march, playing, from the elevator.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your personnel form correctly.&quot; He stood, lean, all bone and muscle, and bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European. Sandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a curtsy? Orison wondered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders stayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome, to the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after" />
    <node id="1. Dink Gerding is introducing and explaining to Orison that the tiny pink creatures are not spiders but rather Microfabridae, a type of organism related to shellfish. They are harmless as they eat only stone and metal and couldn't hurt a fly. They are small, fast-moving, and have a flesh-colored body making them nearly invisible against human skin. One key characteristic is their attraction to gold, which is why one of them was scratching at Orison's high-school class ring.&#10;2. When Orison touches one of the Microfabridae, she describes the experience as feeling crisp and hard, like a legged grain of sand." />
    <node id="1. Orison thought she saw Ben Franklin at the bottom of the tank, but she dismissed it as nonsensical. This is likely a hallucination or misperception brought on by her fear and disgust at the sight of millions of tiny spiders in the tank. The text describes Orison's reaction to the spiders as being triggered by their movement and the green fluid they are in, which suggests that she is experiencing a strong phobic response to the situation. In this state, it is common for people to have unusual perceptions or misinterpretations of their surroundings, which is likely what happened when Orison thought she saw Ben Franklin winking at her from the tank." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is a metaphorical representation of the natural behavior or biological process of the Microfabridae, which has been going on for a million years. It could be their mating call, feeding response, or communication method.&#10;2. According to Dink, the &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; sounds like the sighing of wind in winter trees, with wildness, storm and danger as its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace and harbor. He compares it to the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable, and behind this, the quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.&#10;3. The significance of the &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is that it represents the harmony and unity of these tiny workers while they work in the bank. It also highlights their natural behavior and biological process, which has been going on for a long time, and is essential for their survival, reproduction, or other vital functions.&#10;4. The &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is also related to the commercial process that Dink's company is developing, as the Microfabridae are used in this process, and they sing this hymn while they work. However, the specific details of this commercial process and the exact function of the Microfabridae in it have not been disclosed yet." />

Some possible reasons for this task include:&#10;&#10;* It could be that her reading is being recorded for transcription or archival purposes, as part of an effort to document and preserve news articles and other materials relevant to the bank's operations.&#10;* The task may also be part of a broader information-gathering or monitoring effort, in which case Orison's readings could be used to track developments and trends in the financial industry or to monitor for potential risks and opportunities related to the bank's business.&#10;* Alternatively, the task of reading aloud into a microphone may serve as a test for Orison, evaluating her adaptability, reliability, and trustworthiness in handling unconventional tasks as part of her role as a secretary at the Taft Bank. This could be especially important given the laissez-faire management style of the bank, which suggests that Orison may need to take initiative and manage her own responsibilities with minimal supervision.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the specific purpose of Orison's task is not entirely clear, it seems likely that she has been assigned this role as part of her broader duties as a secretary at the Taft Bank.

She responds to Monitor J-12's compliment about her being beautiful with surprise and curiosity, asking how they know that and suggesting that she is not used to receiving such compliments. This shows that she has a playful and inquisitive side, and may appreciate unconventional or unexpected interactions.&#10;5. Orison values clear communication and honesty. She is direct and straightforward with Dink Gerding when he asks her out for dinner and a dance, saying that they've only just met and need to get to know each other better. This suggests that she values building genuine connections with people and wants to make sure that she is on the same page as the other person before pursuing further interaction." />

It also highlights their natural behavior and biological process, which has been going on for a long time, and is essential for their survival, reproduction, or other vital functions.&#10;4. The &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is also related to the commercial process that Dink's company is developing, as the Microfabridae are used in this process, and they sing this hymn while they work. However, the specific details of this commercial process and the exact function of the Microfabridae in it have not been disclosed yet.">

The laissez-faire management style of the bank may have also played a role in her selection for this particular task.">

The &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is a metaphorical representation of the natural behavior or biological process of the Microfabridae, which has been going on for a million years. It could be their mating call, feeding response, or communication method.&#10;2. According to Dink, the &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; sounds like the sighing of wind in winter trees, with wildness, storm and danger as its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace and harbor. He compares it to the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable, and behind this, the quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.&#10;3. The significance of the &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is that it represents the harmony and unity of these tiny workers while they work in the bank. It also highlights their natural behavior and biological process, which has been going on for a long time, and is essential for their survival, reproduction, or other vital functions.&#10;4. The &quot;hymn of the Microfabridae&quot; is also related to the commercial process that Dink's company is developing, as the Microfabridae are used in this process, and they sing this hymn while they work. However, the specific details of this commercial process and the exact function of the Microfabridae in it have not been disclosed yet.">

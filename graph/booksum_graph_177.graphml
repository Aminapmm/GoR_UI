Additionally, Rebecca thinks that her aunt would be miserable without her and that the next place in her heart is hers. Regarding Sir Pitt, Rebecca states that he knows she is married but not to whom, and he is not very displeased yet.

Who has not admired the&#10;artifices and delicate approaches with which women &quot;prepare&quot; their&#10;friends for bad news?  Miss Crawley's two friends made such an&#10;apparatus of mystery before they broke the intelligence to her, that&#10;they worked her up to the necessary degree of doubt and alarm.&#10;&#10;&quot;And she refused Sir Pitt, my dear, dear Miss Crawley, prepare yourself&#10;for it,&quot; Mrs. Bute said, &quot;because--because she couldn't help herself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course there was a reason,&quot; Miss Crawley answered. &quot;She liked&#10;somebody else.

    <node id="The narrative suggests that genteel marriage ceremonies at St. George's, Hanover Square, often evoke strong emotional responses from women, even those who are not directly involved. This is attributed to the romantic and sentimental nature of the occasion, which stirs the &quot;hysterical sympathies&quot; of women. The scene of a bridegroom and a bride coming together in matrimony is described as beautiful, with the groom on his knees before the bride - an image that would naturally evoke feelings of love and joy. The emotional reactions of women, such as crying and hiding their faces in handkerchiefs, are a manifestation of these feelings, reflecting their investment in the romantic ideal of marriage." />

As an observer of human nature, I regularly&#10;frequent St. George's, Hanover Square, during the genteel marriage&#10;season; and though I have never seen the bridegroom's male friends give&#10;way to tears, or the beadles and officiating clergy any way affected,&#10;yet it is not at all uncommon to see women who are not in the least&#10;concerned in the operations going on--old ladies who are long past&#10;marrying, stout middle-aged females with plenty of sons and daughters,&#10;let alone pretty young creatures in pink bonnets, who are on their&#10;promotion, and may naturally take an interest in the ceremony--I say it&#10;is quite common to see the women present piping, sobbing, sniffling;&#10;hiding their little faces in their little useless pocket-handkerchiefs;&#10;and heaving, old and young, with emotion.

Who needs to be told, that if a woman has a will she will&#10;assuredly find a way?--My belief is that one day, when Miss Sharp had&#10;gone to pass the forenoon with her dear friend Miss Amelia Sedley in&#10;Russell Square, a lady very like her might have been seen entering a&#10;church in the City, in company with a gentleman with dyed mustachios,&#10;who, after a quarter of an hour's interval, escorted her back to the&#10;hackney-coach in waiting, and that this was a quiet bridal party.&#10;&#10;And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the&#10;probability of a gentleman marrying anybody?

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Rebecca had someone else in mind when she refused Sir Pitt's proposal, but her specific identity is not explicitly mentioned. The private reasons for Rebecca's refusal include:&#10;&#10;1. Prior attachment: Rebecca had feelings for another person, which suggests that she was already married or involved with someone else when Sir Pitt proposed to her. This reason is inferred from Briggs' acute observation and Miss Crawley's direct question about the existence of a previous attachment.&#10;2. Age, station, and habits of Sir Pitt: Rebecca felt that there were significant differences between them due to their age difference, social status, and lifestyle, which would make marriage impossible for her.&#10;3. Timing of the proposal: Rebecca considered it inappropriate to entertain marriage proposals when the funeral of the lover's (presumably her own) deceased wife had not taken place.&#10;&#10;While the identity of the person Rebecca has in mind is not explicitly stated, it can be speculated that she may have been married or involved with someone else based on the context given in the narrative." />

I would have had the handsomest&#10;carriage in London, and a box at the opera; and I would have been&#10;presented next season.  All this might have been; and now--now all was&#10;doubt and mystery.&#10;&#10;But Rebecca was a young lady of too much resolution and energy of&#10;character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the&#10;irrevocable past; so, having devoted only the proper portion of regret&#10;to it, she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future, which&#10;was now vastly more important to her.  And she surveyed her position,&#10;and its hopes, doubts, and chances.&#10;&#10;In the first place, she was MARRIED--that was a great fact.  Sir Pitt&#10;knew it.  She was not so much surprised into the avowal, as induced to&#10;make it by a sudden calculation. It must have" />
    <node id="Becky Sharp, also known as Rebecca Sharp, proposed a clandestine marriage to Rawdon Crawley. This measure was necessary due to Miss Crawley's initial negative reaction to Sir Pitt's proposal. Becky had refused to marry Sir Pitt, and Miss Crawley had been mollified by her refusal, leading to the liberal and generous behavior from Miss Crawley that Rebecca took advantage of for her own benefit. By marrying Rawdon secretly and quickly, Rebecca could secure her position in the family before Miss Crawley discovered their relationship, potentially causing any negative consequences. This allowed Rebecca to assume the role of Lady Crawley, which she might not have been able to do otherwise." />
    <node id=" and they're off to Gretney Green!&quot;&#10;We would devote a chapter to describe the emotions of Mrs. Firkin, did&#10;not the passions of her mistresses occupy our genteeler muse.&#10;&#10;When Mrs. Bute Crawley, numbed with midnight travelling, and warming&#10;herself at the newly crackling parlour fire, heard from Miss Briggs the&#10;intelligence of the clandestine marriage, she declared it was quite&#10;providential that she should have arrived at such a time to assist poor&#10;dear Miss Crawley in supporting the shock--that Rebecca was an artful&#10;little hussy of whom she had always had her suspicions; and that as for&#10;Rawdon Crawley, she never could account for his aunt's infatuation&#10;regarding him, and had long considered him a profligate, lost, and&#10;abandoned being.  And this awful conduct, Mrs. Bute said, will have at&#10;least this good effect, it will open poor dear Miss Crawley's eyes to&#10;the real character of this wicked man.  Then Mrs. Bute had a&#10;comfortable hot toast and tea; and as there was a vacant room in the&#10;house now, there was no need for" />

It was scarcely out of his mouth when Mrs. Firkin&#10;and Miss Briggs had streamed up the stairs, had rushed into the&#10;drawing-room where Miss Crawley was reading the French novel, and had&#10;given that old lady the astounding intelligence that Sir Pitt was on&#10;his knees, proposing to Miss Sharp.  And if you calculate the time for&#10;the above dialogue to take place--the time for Briggs and Firkin to fly&#10;to the drawing-room--the time for Miss Crawley to be astonished, and to&#10;drop her volume of Pigault le Brun--and the time for her to come&#10;downstairs--you will see how exactly accurate this history is, and how&#10;Miss Crawley must have appeared at the very instant when Rebecca had&#10;assumed the attitude of humility" />

Rebecca might, perhaps,&#10;have told more: but five minutes after Miss Briggs's arrival in&#10;Rebecca's apartment, Miss Crawley actually made her appearance&#10;there--an unheard-of honour--her impatience had overcome her; she could&#10;not wait for the tardy operations of her ambassadress: so she came in&#10;person, and ordered Briggs out of the room.

Captain Dobbin did not correct this error of the&#10;worthy lady, but listened to all her story of complaints and&#10;misfortunes with great sympathy--condoled with her losses and&#10;privations, and agreed in reprehending the cruel conduct of Mr. Osborne&#10;towards his first benefactor. When she had eased her overflowing bosom&#10;somewhat, and poured forth many of her sorrows, he had the courage to&#10;ask actually to see Amelia, who was above in her room as usual, and&#10;whom her mother led trembling downstairs.&#10;&#10;Her appearance was so ghastly, and her look of despair so pathetic,&#10;that honest William Dobbin was frightened as he beheld it; and read the&#10;most fatal forebodings in that pale fixed face.

And I--I think I'll go upstairs, Mamma, for&#10;I'm not very strong.&quot; And with this, and a curtsey and a smile, the&#10;poor child went her way.  The mother, as she led her up, cast back&#10;looks of anguish towards Dobbin.  The good fellow wanted no such&#10;appeal.  He loved her himself too fondly for that.  Inexpressible&#10;grief, and pity, and terror pursued him, and he came away as if he was&#10;a criminal after seeing her.&#10;&#10;When Osborne heard that his friend had found her, he made hot and&#10;anxious inquiries regarding the poor child.  How was she?  How did she&#10;look?  What did she say?  His comrade took his hand, and looked him in&#10;the face.&#10;&#10;&quot;George, she's dying,&quot; William Dobbin said--and" />

Such criminal imprudence Mrs. Smith never&#10;knew of; such horrid familiarities Mrs. Brown had always condemned, and&#10;the end might be a warning to HER daughters. &quot;Captain Osborne, of&#10;course, could not marry a bankrupt's daughter,&quot; the Misses Dobbin said.&#10;&quot;It was quite enough to have been swindled by the father.

    <node id="1. Defiance of Social Norms: By marrying Rebecca Sharp, who is socially inferior to him, Mr. Rawdon Crawley goes against the traditional expectations of his social class and time period. This act can be seen as an assertion of individual desire over societal pressure.&#10;2. Emotional Connection: The narrative mentions the strong feelings that developed between Mr. Crawley and Rebecca (such as admiration, delight, passion, and adoration). These emotions suggest a genuine connection that goes beyond social conventions or materialistic concerns.&#10;3. Historical Precedents: The narrative draws attention to historical examples of wise and learned men marrying their servants, implying that Mr. Crawley is not an exception in this regard. This comparison further emphasizes the sincerity and authenticity of his feelings for Rebecca.&#10;4. Population Growth: The text also mentions the idea that if people only made prudent marriages, population growth would be significantly reduced. By following their desires and marrying Rebecca, Mr. Crawley is contributing to the natural process of population growth.&#10;&#10;Taken together, these factors suggest that Mr. Rawdon Crawley's marriage to Rebecca Sharp was indeed one of his most honest actions in light of historical examples and societal expectations regarding passion, love, and individual choice." />

And are we to expect a heavy dragoon&#10;with strong desires and small brains, who had never controlled a&#10;passion in his life, to become prudent all of a sudden, and to refuse&#10;to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind?  If people&#10;only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there would be!&#10;&#10;It seems to me, for my part, that Mr. Rawdon's marriage was one of the&#10;honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that&#10;gentleman's biography which has to do with the present history.  No one&#10;will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman, or, being&#10;captivated, to marry her; and the admiration, the delight, the passion,&#10;the wonder, the unbounded confidence, and frantic adoration with which,&#10;by degrees, this big warrior got to regard the little Rebecca, were&#10;feelings which the ladies" />
    <node id="Rebecca thinks she and her love will &quot;conquer&quot; due to her belief that her aunt, Matante, dotes on him so much that she would pardon him anything. She also feels that Matante would be miserable without her and that the next place in her heart is hers. Once Matante hears the news of their marriage, Rebecca thinks any anger will only be momentary, as she is confident in her aunt's fondness for her partner. This special relationship and Matante's kindness and graciousness play a significant role in Rebecca's optimism about their ability to overcome challenges they face as a couple." />

And so, resolved that Miss Crawley should have&#10;the news, the young person debated in her mind as to the best means of&#10;conveying it to her; and whether she should face the storm that must&#10;come, or fly and avoid it until its first fury was blown over.  In this&#10;state of meditation she wrote the following letter:&#10;&#10;Dearest Friend,&#10;&#10;The great crisis which we have debated about so often is COME.  Half of&#10;my secret is known, and I have thought and thought, until I am quite&#10;sure that now is the time to reveal THE WHOLE OF THE MYSTERY. Sir Pitt&#10;came to me this morning, and made--what do you think?--A DECLARATION IN&#10;FORM.  Think of that!  Poor little me.  I might have been Lady Crawley.&#10;How pleased Mrs. Bute would have been: and ma tante if I had taken&#10;precedence of her! I might have been somebody's mamma, instead of--O, I&#10;tremble, I tremble, when" />
    <node id="Based on Rebecca's calculation and the information provided about Miss Crawley's character and her relationship with Rebecca, it is likely that Miss Crawley will eventually accept and forgive Rebecca for marrying someone else. Rebecca's decision to reveal the news in person and highlight Miss Crawley's fondness for her nephew, liberal opinions, and repeated expressions of fondness for Rebecca herself suggest that she believes Miss Crawley will ultimately understand and continue to value their relationship.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley is known for her daring liberal opinions, romantic tendencies, and attachment to Rebecca, which may contribute to her acceptance of the news. Upon hearing about Rebecca's refusal, Miss Crawley immediately guesses that there must be someone else involved, suggesting she is not entirely surprised by the revelation. Although initially taken aback, she quickly moves on to asking for specific details about the other person.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Miss Crawley has shown a generous and liberal nature towards Rebecca in the past, which could lead her to eventually forgive and accept Rebecca's decision. Therefore, while there might be some initial tension or disagreement, Rebecca's calculation seems to take into account the likelihood of Miss Crawley ultimately accepting and forgiving her for marrying someone else." />
    <node id="&#10;knew it.  She was not so much surprised into the avowal, as induced to&#10;make it by a sudden calculation. It must have come some day: and why&#10;not now as at a later period? He who would have married her himself&#10;must at least be silent with regard to her marriage. How Miss Crawley&#10;would bear the news--was the great question. Misgivings Rebecca had;&#10;but she remembered all Miss Crawley had said; the old lady's avowed&#10;contempt for birth; her daring liberal opinions; her general romantic&#10;propensities; her almost doting attachment to her nephew, and her&#10;repeatedly expressed fondness for Rebecca herself.  She is so fond of&#10;him, Rebecca thought, that she will forgive him anything: she is so&#10;used to me that I don't think she could be comfortable without me: when&#10;the eclaircissement comes there will be a scene, and hysterics, and a&#10;great quarrel, and then a great reconciliation.  At all events, what&#10;use was there in delaying? the die was thrown, and now or to-morrow the&#10;issue must be the same.  And so, resolved that Miss Crawley" />
    <node id="In the dramatic conclusion of the story, Rebecca's husband, Sir Pitt, reacts with rage and disbelief when she reveals that she is already married. He exclaims, &quot;Married; you're joking... Who'd ever go to marry you without a shilling to your fortune?&quot; This reaction causes Rebecca great distress, and she bursts into tears. Sir Pitt's surprise and anger suggest that he had no prior knowledge of Rebecca's supposed marriage, and the revelation takes him completely by surprise." />

What&#10;think you were the private feelings of Miss, no (begging her pardon) of&#10;Mrs. Rebecca?  If, a few pages back, the present writer claimed the&#10;privilege of peeping into Miss Amelia Sedley's bedroom, and&#10;understanding with the omniscience of the novelist all the gentle pains&#10;and passions which were tossing upon that innocent pillow, why should&#10;he not declare himself to be Rebecca's confidante too, master of her&#10;secrets, and seal-keeper of that young woman's conscience?&#10;&#10;Well, then, in the first place, Rebecca gave way to some very sincere&#10;and touching regrets that a piece of marvellous good fortune should&#10;have been so near her, and she actually obliged to decline it.  In this&#10;natural emotion every properly regulated mind will certainly share.&#10;What good mother is there that would not commiserate a penniless&#10;spinster, who might have" />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that when &quot;gently constituted, frail, and delicate&quot; souls like Amelia commit the &quot;crime&quot; of loving someone against reason and have their hopes crushed, they experience great emotional turmoil and suffering. In Amelia's case, she becomes increasingly unhappy and isolated after George breaks his promise to marry her, leading to her eventual death. The passage emphasizes that this is not a universal experience, but rather a potential outcome for certain sensitive individuals who love too passionately and are unable to cope with the disappointment of unrequited or unrealized love." />
    <node id="--of the crime she had long ago been guilty--the crime of&#10;loving wrongly, too violently, against reason. She told no more of her&#10;thoughts now than she had before.  She seemed scarcely more unhappy now&#10;when convinced all hope was over, than before when she felt but dared&#10;not confess that it was gone.  So she changed from the large house to&#10;the small one without any mark or difference; remained in her little&#10;room for the most part; pined silently; and died away day by day.  I do&#10;not mean to say that all females are so.  My dear Miss Bullock, I do&#10;not think your heart would break in this way.  You are a strong-minded&#10;young woman with proper principles. I do not venture to say that mine&#10;would; it has suffered, and, it must be confessed, survived. But there&#10;are some souls thus gently constituted, thus frail, and delicate, and&#10;tender.&#10;&#10;Whenever old John Sedley thought of the affair between George and&#10;Amelia, or alluded to it, it was with bitterness almost as great as Mr.&#10;Osborne himself had shown.

No power on earth, he swore, would&#10;induce him to marry his daughter to the son of such a villain, and he&#10;ordered Emmy to banish George from her mind, and to return all the&#10;presents and letters which she had ever had from him.&#10;&#10;She promised acquiescence, and tried to obey.  She put up the two or&#10;three trinkets: and, as for the letters, she drew them out of the place&#10;where she kept them; and read them over--as if she did not know them by&#10;heart already: but she could not part with them.  That effort was too&#10;much for her; she placed them back in her bosom again--as you have seen&#10;a woman nurse a child that is dead.  Young Amelia felt that she would&#10;die or lose her senses outright, if torn away from this last&#10;consolation. How she used to blush and lighten up when those letters&#10;came!  How she used to trip away with a beating heart, so that she&#10;" />

A long engagement is a partnership which one party is free to&#10;keep or to break, but which involves all the capital of the other.&#10;&#10;Be cautious then, young ladies; be wary how you engage.  Be shy of&#10;loving frankly; never tell all you feel, or (a better way still), feel&#10;very little.  See the consequences of being prematurely honest and&#10;confiding, and mistrust yourselves and everybody.  Get yourselves&#10;married as they do in France, where the lawyers are the bridesmaids and&#10;confidantes.  At any rate, never have any feelings which may make you&#10;uncomfortable, or make any promises which you cannot at any required&#10;moment command and withdraw.  That is the way to get on, and be&#10;respected, and have a virtuous character in Vanity Fair.&#10;&#10;If Amelia could have heard the comments" />

I&#10;have never heard that poverty was any safeguard against it.

Tell me all, and let me console you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you could, dear Madam,&quot; Rebecca said in the same tearful tone.&#10;&quot;Indeed, indeed, I need it.&quot; And she laid her head upon Miss Crawley's&#10;shoulder and wept there so naturally that the old lady, surprised into&#10;sympathy, embraced her with an almost maternal kindness, uttered many&#10;soothing protests of regard and affection for her, vowed that she loved&#10;her as a daughter, and would do everything in her power to serve her.&#10;" />
    <node id="The arrival of Mrs. Bute Crawley is welcomed with pleasure by Miss Crawley because she is pleased at the notion of having a gossip with her sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawley, the funeral arrangements pending, and Sir Pitt's abrupt proposal to Rebecca Sharp. Even though Miss Crawley might not have felt great delight in seeing Mrs. Bute Crawley under normal circumstances, she is happy to see her now because she wants to discuss the recent events in the family with someone she is close to. Additionally, Mrs. Bute Crawley's arrival provides a distraction from Miss Crawley's own feelings of grief and loss regarding the late Lady Crawley." />
    <node id=" Mrs. Bute had a&#10;comfortable hot toast and tea; and as there was a vacant room in the&#10;house now, there was no need for her to remain at the Gloster Coffee&#10;House where the Portsmouth mail had set her down, and whence she&#10;ordered Mr. Bowls's aide-de-camp the footman to bring away her trunks.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley, be it known, did not leave her room until near noon--taking&#10;chocolate in bed in the morning, while Becky Sharp read the&#10;Morning Post to her, or otherwise amusing herself or dawdling.  The&#10;conspirators below agreed that they would spare the dear lady's&#10;feelings until she appeared in her drawing-room: meanwhile it was&#10;announced to her that Mrs. Bute Crawley had come up from Hampshire by&#10;the mail, was staying at the Gloster, sent her love to Miss Crawley,&#10;and asked for breakfast with Miss Briggs.

They were&#10;forced to take her back to the room which she had just quitted. One fit&#10;of hysterics succeeded another.  The doctor was sent for--the&#10;apothecary arrived. Mrs. Bute took up the post of nurse by her bedside.&#10;&quot;Her relations ought to be round about her,&quot; that amiable woman said.&#10;&#10;She had scarcely been carried up to her room, when a new person arrived&#10;to whom it was also necessary to break the news.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the gentleman who has won Miss Sharp's heart is Rawdon Crawley. This is revealed when Rebecca acknowledges that there is someone who has touched her heart, and she lays her head on Miss Crawley's shoulder and weeps, leading to Miss Crawley's discovery of their secret marriage. The text also mentions that Mrs. Firkin and Miss Briggs had seen Sir Pitt proposing to Rebecca through a keyhole, confirming that Rawdon is the gentleman in question." />
    <node id="The passage describes a scene at an auction where various items are being sold, including a picture of a &quot;gentleman on an elephant.&quot; The auctioneer, Mr. Hammerdown, is trying to sell the picture for at least twenty guineas, highlighting its details such as the attitude of the elephant and the banyan tree and pagoda in the distance, which are meant to represent some interesting spot in Britain's Eastern possessions. However, there are no takers for the picture until an officer with a young lady on his arm starts bidding against a Hebrew gentleman employed by the elephant purchasers. The brisk competition ends when the officer and lady desist, and the hammer comes down, knocking the lot down for half a guinea to the Hebrew gentleman's employer.&#10;&#10;The picture of a gentleman on an elephant plays a minor role in this scene as one of the items being sold at the auction. However, it also serves as a source of amusement and entertainment for the attendees, who make jokes about the size of the &quot;elephant-rider&quot; and the possibility of the gentleman falling off the elephant. The picture's connection to Britain's Eastern possessions also highlights the country's colonial presence and power, which is a recurring theme throughout the narrative." />

Having&#10;effected the purchase, he sate up as if he was greatly relieved, and&#10;the unsuccessful competitors catching a glimpse of him at this moment,&#10;the lady said to her friend,&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, Rawdon, it's Captain Dobbin.&quot;&#10;&#10;I suppose Becky was discontented with the new piano her husband had&#10;hired for her, or perhaps the proprietors of that instrument had&#10;fetched it away, declining farther credit, or perhaps she had a&#10;particular attachment for the one which she had just tried to purchase,&#10;recollecting it in old days, when she used to play upon it, in the&#10;little sitting-room of our dear Amelia Sed" />

As he continues to accumulate debt, he approaches an inevitable day of reckoning when he will no longer be able to meet his financial obligations. This is hinted at in the narrative when it mentions that &quot;the end must come some day.&quot; Jack's situation highlights the dangers of living beyond one's means and relying on credit to fund a lifestyle that is unsustainable in the long run.

    <node id="The narrative suggests that being prematurely honest and confiding in matters of love can lead to negative consequences for young women. It is advised that they should be cautious and wary about engaging their hearts and expressing their feelings too openly. This is because once feelings are revealed, there is a risk of rejection or disappointment, as seen with Amelia's experience. To protect themselves and maintain a good reputation in society, young ladies can employ the following strategies:&#10;&#10;1. Temper their emotions: It is suggested that women should be cautious about revealing all their feelings or even feeling too much. By guarding their emotions, they can avoid potential heartbreak and preserve their dignity.&#10;2. Be discreet: Women are advised to be discreet in expressing their affections, as sharing too much can lead to vulnerability and loss of control over the situation. Keeping some feelings private or hidden allows young ladies to maintain an upper hand in romantic relationships.&#10;3. Seek professional advice: The narrative suggests that women should follow the French tradition, where lawyers handle marriage proceedings. This can help ensure a secure legal standing and avoid any future complications in relationships.&#10;4. Protect oneself: Women are encouraged to make cautious decisions about who they choose to love and how much they reveal. By taking calculated steps and maintaining control over their emotions and actions, young ladies can safeguard themselves from potential harm.&#10;5. Avoid excessive emotional displays: The narrative highlights the hysterical sympathies of women in romantic situations. To maintain a good reputation, it is advisable to avoid excessive emotional reactions, such as crying or hiding one's face, which could be perceived as overly sentimental or weak.&#10;&#10;In summary, young ladies should be cautious and discreet when engaging in matters of the heart to protect themselves from potential disappointment and maintain a good reputation in society. By guarding their emotions and making calculated decisions, they can secure their future and avoid any negative consequences that may arise from premature honesty and confiding in love." />
    <node id="William Dobbin and George Osborne both have strong emotional reactions when reflecting on Amelia Sedley's life and character. Upon hearing about Amelia's despair and deteriorating health after their separation, Dobbin is deeply moved and considers her to be &quot;the sweetest, the purest, the tenderest, the most angelical of young women&quot; (Thackeray). He feels anguish at the thought of her being alone and broken-hearted.&#10;&#10;Osborne, too, experiences regret and shame when contemplating his past relationship with Amelia. He sees &quot;her good and beautiful&quot; in various homely scenes from their shared past, realizing his own selfishness and indifference towards her perfect purity. He is filled with remorse for not valuing her enough while they were together.&#10;&#10;Both Dobbin and Osborne view Amelia in a highly positive light, seeing her as an innocent, tender, and loving individual who has been central to their lives. They come to appreciate her true worth only when confronted with the possibility of losing her forever." />

Emmy was much too sad to answer, or even to be aware of&#10;the attempts the other was making in her favour.&#10;&#10;Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne, this servant-maid&#10;came into Amelia's room, where she sate as usual, brooding&#10;silently over her letters--her little treasures.

She communicated her intentions to Rawdon, who agreed to them, and they both went to Gretney Green to get married secretly. This was a decisive move made by Rebecca to secure her position in the family before Miss Crawley discovered their relationship and potentially caused any negative consequences.&#10;&#10;Regarding winning over Miss Crawley's favor, Rebecca had already been successful in gaining her favor through her refusal of Sir Pitt's proposal and by taking advantage of Miss Crawley's generous behavior towards her. However, after the clandestine marriage, she planned to use Mrs. Bute Crawley's arrival as an opportunity to present herself as a victim of Rawdon's wicked ways and gain sympathy from Miss Crawley. By doing so, Rebecca aimed to secure her position as Lady Crawley and solidify her place in the family." />

    <node id="When one person has been significantly indebted to another and later they have a falling out, they may become a severe enemy due to a common sense of decency. This sense of decency compels them to justify their own hard-heartedness and ingratitude by proving the other party's guilt. It is not merely about being selfish or angry; instead, it becomes essential for them to show that their partner had betrayed and cheated them, which led to their current predicament.&#10;&#10;This behavior stems from a need for consistency in their self-image. By demonstrating the fallen man as a villain, they can preserve their perception of being righteous and fair. This is especially true during financial disputes where both parties may hide the truth or exaggerate to prove their point, with each accusing the other of dishonesty.&#10;&#10;In such situations, creditors tend to be harsh, suspecting that no man in a dire financial state can be entirely honest. The narrative emphasizes this idea by mentioning, &quot;As a general rule, which may make all creditors who are inclined to be severe pretty comfortable in their minds, no men embarrassed are altogether honest, very likely.&quot; Thus, a creditor will feel justified in reviling and attacking the one who owes them money." />

To account for your own hard-heartedness and ingratitude in&#10;such a case, you are bound to prove the other party's crime.  It is not&#10;that you are selfish, brutal, and angry at the failure of a&#10;speculation--no, no--it is that your partner has led you into it by the&#10;basest treachery and with the most sinister motives.  From a mere sense&#10;of consistency, a persecutor is bound to show that the fallen man is a&#10;villain--otherwise he, the persecutor, is a wretch himself.&#10;&#10;And as a general rule, which may make all creditors who are inclined to&#10;be severe pretty comfortable in their minds, no men embarrassed are&#10;altogether honest, very likely" />

On George's intercourse with&#10;Amelia he put an instant veto--menacing the youth with maledictions if&#10;he broke his commands, and vilipending the poor innocent girl as the&#10;basest and most artful of vixens.

Good old John Sedley&#10;was a ruined man.  His name had been proclaimed as a defaulter on the&#10;Stock Exchange, and his bankruptcy and commercial extermination had&#10;followed.  Mr. Osborne's butler came to buy some of the famous port&#10;wine to transfer to the cellars over the way. As for one dozen&#10;well-manufactured silver spoons and forks at per oz., and one dozen&#10;dessert ditto ditto, there were three young stockbrokers (Messrs.

    <node id="The &quot;big warrior&quot; referred to is likely Sir Pitt, who has expressed feelings of surprise, anger, and disbelief upon learning that Rebecca is already married. Initially, he reacted with exclamations of shock and doubt, suggesting that he was taken aback by the news and did not believe it at first.&#10;&#10;However, as the narrative progresses, it becomes clear that Sir Pitt has developed a certain level of respect for Rebecca's abilities and qualities, despite his initial anger. He recognizes her intelligence and charm, which is evident when he comments on how she managed to secure a husband with such ease. This suggests that he sees her as a formidable and capable person who can navigate complex social situations and relationships.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Sir Pitt does not seem overly displeased about Rebecca's marriage once he learns more about the situation. He is curious about her husband and wants to know more details, indicating that he may be willing to accept and understand her decision.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Sir Pitt initially reacts with anger and surprise, his feelings towards Rebecca appear to evolve throughout the narrative. He comes to respect her abilities and qualities, even if he does not fully agree with or approve of her choices." />
    <node id="Based on Rebecca's calculation and understanding of Miss Crawley's character, relationships, and past behavior, it is likely that Rebecca anticipates a mixture of surprise, curiosity, and eventually acceptance from Miss Crawley upon hearing about her plans to marry. Rebecca's decision to reveal the news in person and highlight Miss Crawley's fondness for her nephew, liberal opinions, and repeated expressions of fondness for Rebecca herself suggest that she believes Miss Crawley will ultimately understand and continue to value their relationship.&#10;&#10;Rebecca might expect some initial tension or disagreement due to the surprise factor, but considering Miss Crawley's daring liberal opinions, romantic tendencies, and attachment to Rebecca, she may believe that her aunt will come around eventually. The fact that Miss Crawley immediately guesses there must be someone else involved upon hearing about Rebecca's refusal also indicates that Rebecca anticipates a relatively understanding reaction from her aunt, as it suggests Miss Crawley is not entirely surprised by the revelation and is more interested in the details of the other person rather than expressing outright disapproval.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca might be cautiously optimistic about Miss Crawley's response, expecting some initial shock or disappointment, but ultimately believing that her aunt will accept and forgive her for marrying someone else due to their previously established close relationship and Miss Crawley's generous nature towards Rebecca in the past." />
    <node id="The criticisms of Amelia's character in Vanity Fair after her father's ruin revolved around her &quot;crimes&quot; of imprudence and familiarities, which were considered inappropriate for a gentleman's daughter. Some comments included, &quot;Captain Osborne, of course, could not marry a bankrupt's daughter,&quot; and &quot;her folly had really passed all - what?&quot; (Thackeray). These criticisms suggested that Amelia's family background and actions had negatively impacted her reputation, making her an unsuitable partner in the eyes of society.&#10;&#10;Captain Dobbin vehemently defended Amelia's character, expressing his deep admiration for her by describing her as &quot;the sweetest, the purest, the tenderest, the most angelical of young women&quot; (Thackeray). He was filled with anguish at the thought of her being alone and broken-hearted. Moreover, he strongly asserted that no one should dare to utter a word against her. Despite others' criticisms, Dobbin maintained his unwavering support for Amelia and her engagement to George Osborne." />

The arrival of Mrs. Bute Crawley is welcomed with pleasure by Miss Crawley because she is pleased at the notion of having a gossip with her sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawley, the funeral arrangements pending, and Sir Pitt's abrupt proposal to Rebecca Sharp.&#10;3. Rebecca Sharp took determined steps with Rawdon Crawley by planning a clandestine marriage. She communicated her intentions to Rawdon, who agreed to them, and they both went to Gretney Green to get married secretly.&#10;4.

It is only mentioned in passing by Miss Briggs as a possible reason for Rebecca's refusal of Sir Pitt's proposal, and no details are given about the person involved. Therefore, it is not possible to determine who this previous attachment might have been based on the given narrative." />
    <node id="1. Rawdon Crawley has been denied access to Miss Crawley because she is upset about his clandestine marriage to Rebecca Sharp, which she considers a shocking and inappropriate action. Miss Crawley had favored Rebecca, but her feelings towards her have changed due to this secret marriage, leading her to deny Rawdon entry into her home.&#10;2. Mrs. Bute Crawley's continued presence at Park Lane can be attributed to her desire to support Miss Crawley during this difficult time and help her navigate the fallout from Rebecca and Rawdon's secret marriage. Additionally, Miss Crawley is unwell and has not been leaving the house, making it necessary for Mrs. Bute to remain there to provide assistance and companionship." />

Rawdon was&#10;denied the door by Mr. Bowls; his servants could not get a lodgment in&#10;the house at Park Lane; his letters were sent back unopened.

Joseph Sedley, being Mr. Sedley's son, is aware of his father's financial situation but does not seem to be significantly affected emotionally by the family's ruin. Instead, he focuses on his own interests, using the money his father gives him to pay for new clothes and epaulets.&#10;3. Joseph's apparent lack of concern for his family's plight may strain his relationships with them further, as they struggle with their financial difficulties and the loss of Amelia's engagement. While Joseph might not have been very close to Amelia, her situation would likely still affect him at a personal level, given that they are siblings.&#10;4. Joseph's preoccupation with his own appearance and interests could be seen as self-centered or insensitive in the context of the family's struggles. This behavior may lead to feelings of disappointment, frustration, or resentment among other family members, further complicating their relationships." />

His father told him of the wicked, rascally, shameful&#10;conduct of the bankrupt, reminded him of what he had said about Amelia,&#10;and that their connection was broken off for ever; and gave him that&#10;evening a good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in&#10;which he looked so well.  Money was always useful to this free-handed&#10;young fellow, and he took it without many words. The bills were up in&#10;the Sedley house, where he had passed so many, many happy hours.  He&#10;could see them as he walked from home that night (to the Old&#10;Slaughters', where he put up when in town) shining white in the moon.&#10;That comfortable home was shut, then, upon Amelia and her parents:&#10;where had they taken refuge?

She felt disappointed as she was missing out on a highly advantageous offer at the very moment when she couldn't accept it due to her prior attachment to someone else. Every properly regulated mind, such as that of a good mother or a well-bred young person in Vanity Fair, would commiserate with Rebecca's disappointment and feel sympathy for her situation. The narrator compares this scenario to an incident where Miss Toady singles out Mrs. Briefless, a poor barrister's wife, for special attention at a party due to her family background, implying that people are generally empathetic towards those who face similar circumstances." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, I can tell you that the gentleman who has won Miss Sharp's heart is Rawdon Crawley.

This reason is inferred from Briggs' acute observation and Miss Crawley's direct question about the existence of a previous attachment.&#10;2.

It is only mentioned in passing by Miss Briggs as a possible reason for Rebecca's refusal of Sir Pitt's proposal, and no details are given about the person involved.

It is advised that they should be cautious and wary about engaging their hearts and expressing their feelings too openly. This is because once feelings are revealed, there is a risk of rejection or disappointment, as seen with Amelia's experience. To protect themselves and maintain a good reputation in society, young ladies can employ the following strategies:&#10;&#10;1. Temper their emotions: It is suggested that women should be cautious about revealing all their feelings or even feeling too much. By guarding their emotions, they can avoid potential heartbreak and preserve their dignity.&#10;2. Be discreet: Women are advised to be discreet in expressing their affections, as sharing too much can lead to vulnerability and loss of control over the situation. Keeping some feelings private or hidden allows young ladies to maintain an upper hand in romantic relationships.&#10;3. Seek professional advice: The narrative suggests that women should follow the French tradition, where lawyers handle marriage proceedings. This can help ensure a secure legal standing and avoid any future complications in relationships.&#10;4. Protect oneself: Women are encouraged to make cautious decisions about who they choose to love and how much they reveal. By taking calculated steps and maintaining control over their emotions and actions, young ladies can safeguard themselves from potential harm.&#10;5. Avoid excessive emotional displays: The narrative highlights the hysterical sympathies of women in romantic situations. To maintain a good reputation, it is advisable to avoid excessive emotional reactions, such as crying or hiding one's face, which could be perceived as overly sentimental or weak.&#10;&#10;In summary, young ladies should be cautious and discreet when engaging in matters of the heart to protect themselves from potential disappointment and maintain a good reputation in society.

A long engagement is a partnership which one party is free to&#10;keep or to break, but which involves all the capital of the other.&#10;&#10;Be cautious then, young ladies; be wary how you engage.  Be shy of&#10;loving frankly; never tell all you feel, or (a better way still), feel&#10;very little.  See the consequences of being prematurely honest and&#10;confiding, and mistrust yourselves and everybody.  Get yourselves&#10;married as they do in France, where the lawyers are the bridesmaids and&#10;confidantes.  At any rate, never have any feelings which may make you&#10;uncomfortable, or make any promises which you cannot at any required&#10;moment command and withdraw.  That is the way to get on, and be&#10;respected, and have a virtuous character in Vanity Fair.&#10;&#10;If Amelia could have heard the comments" target="The narrative suggests that being prematurely honest and confiding in matters of love can lead to negative consequences for young women. It is advised that they should be cautious and wary about engaging their hearts and expressing their feelings too openly. This is because once feelings are revealed, there is a risk of rejection or disappointment, as seen with Amelia's experience. To protect themselves and maintain a good reputation in society, young ladies can employ the following strategies:&#10;&#10;1. Temper their emotions: It is suggested that women should be cautious about revealing all their feelings or even feeling too much. By guarding their emotions, they can avoid potential heartbreak and preserve their dignity.&#10;2. Be discreet: Women are advised to be discreet in expressing their affections, as sharing too much can lead to vulnerability and loss of control over the situation. Keeping some feelings private or hidden allows young ladies to maintain an upper hand in romantic relationships.&#10;3. Seek professional advice: The narrative suggests that women should follow the French tradition, where lawyers handle marriage proceedings. This can help ensure a secure legal standing and avoid any future complications in relationships.&#10;4. Protect oneself: Women are encouraged to make cautious decisions about who they choose to love and how much they reveal. By taking calculated steps and maintaining control over their emotions and actions, young ladies can safeguard themselves from potential harm.&#10;5. Avoid excessive emotional displays: The narrative highlights the hysterical sympathies of women in romantic situations. To maintain a good reputation, it is advisable to avoid excessive emotional reactions, such as crying or hiding one's face, which could be perceived as overly sentimental or weak.&#10;&#10;In summary, young ladies should be cautious and discreet when engaging in matters of the heart to protect themselves from potential disappointment and maintain a good reputation in society. By guarding their emotions and making calculated decisions, they can secure their future and avoid any negative consequences that may arise from premature honesty and confiding in love.">

This information was surprising to them because Sir Pitt's marriage offer was highly advantageous and prestigious for Rebecca, so it seemed unusual for her to turn it down without a significant reason, such as having feelings for someone else." target="Rebecca experienced sincere and touching regrets that she had to decline Sir Pitt's marriage proposal, which would have brought her great fortune and prestige. She felt disappointed as she was missing out on a highly advantageous offer at the very moment when she couldn't accept it due to her prior attachment to someone else. Every properly regulated mind, such as that of a good mother or a well-bred young person in Vanity Fair, would commiserate with Rebecca's disappointment and feel sympathy for her situation. The narrator compares this scenario to an incident where Miss Toady singles out Mrs. Briefless, a poor barrister's wife, for special attention at a party due to her family background, implying that people are generally empathetic towards those who face similar circumstances.">

To protect themselves and maintain a good reputation in society, young ladies can employ the following strategies:&#10;&#10;1. Temper their emotions: It is suggested that women should be cautious about revealing all their feelings or even feeling too much. By guarding their emotions, they can avoid potential heartbreak and preserve their dignity.&#10;2. Be discreet: Women are advised to be discreet in expressing their affections, as sharing too much can lead to vulnerability and loss of control over the situation. Keeping some feelings private or hidden allows young ladies to maintain an upper hand in romantic relationships.&#10;3. Seek professional advice: The narrative suggests that women should follow the French tradition, where lawyers handle marriage proceedings. This can help ensure a secure legal standing and avoid any future complications in relationships.&#10;4.

By taking calculated steps and maintaining control over their emotions and actions, young ladies can safeguard themselves from potential harm.&#10;5.

To maintain a good reputation, it is advisable to avoid excessive emotional reactions, such as crying or hiding one's face, which could be perceived as overly sentimental or weak.&#10;&#10;In summary, young ladies should be cautious and discreet when engaging in matters of the heart to protect themselves from potential disappointment and maintain a good reputation in society.

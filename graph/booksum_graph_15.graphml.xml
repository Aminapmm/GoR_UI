<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" During Mrs. Harker's trance just before sunrise, she reported hearing water swirling by, the creaking of wood on wood, cattle lowing in the distance, and a queer sound that made her grow pale and silent. This information suggested to the group that the Count's ship might have been damaged and was possibly stopped or delayed near Galatz. As a result, they traveled towards Galatz in anticipation of meeting Jonathan and his companions, who were also heading there in pursuit of the Count."/>
<node id=" between two and three in the morning;&#10;but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot&#10;possibly get in till well after sun-up.

Fortunately it came at a time when&#10;there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a&#10;station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.&#10;Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than&#10;this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's&#10;sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that&#10;her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance&#10;hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes&#10;on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power&#10;over her"/>

The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming&#10;than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was&#10;so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole&#10;soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made&#10;reply:--&#10;&#10;&quot;All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as&#10;of wood on wood.&quot; She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till&#10;to-night.&#10;&#10;And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of&#10;expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;&#10;but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot&#10;possibly get in till well after"/>
<node id="&#10;&#10;_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last&#10;night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us&#10;had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,&#10;and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and&#10;for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.&#10;Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and&#10;more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually&#10;necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but&#10;this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty&#10;resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a&#10;steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear&#10;men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in&#10;the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.&#10;There is tramping of"/>
<node id=" told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in&#10;silence.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time&#10;to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.&#10;Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,&#10;Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no&#10;effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still&#10;greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor&#10;lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--&#10;&#10;&quot;All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the&#10;creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a&#10;queer one like----&quot; She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go on; go on!

Finally, they got&#10;up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase&#10;afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the&#10;peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept&#10;stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push&#10;on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal._&#10;&#10;_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that&#10;this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I&#10;could say was: &quot;dark and quiet.&quot; He is off now buying a carriage and&#10;horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so&#10;that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more&#10;than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if&#10;only we were under different conditions, how delightful"/>
<node id=" us go to meet my&#10;husband who is, I know, coming towards us.&quot; She was looking thin and&#10;pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was&#10;glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the&#10;fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.&#10;&#10;And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet&#10;our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are&#10;coming to meet us.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal._&#10;&#10;_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I&#10;took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did&#10;not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take&#10;heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being&#10;left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our&#10;provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we&#10;could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of"/>
<node id=" The Count's purpose in London was to arrange for a safe and secret way to return to his castle via water. He had knowledge of Slovaks who could transport boxes from Varna to London, as he had been brought from his castle by Szgany and probably delivered to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna for shipping. When the box containing the Count was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky, and instructed him on arranging the carriage of the box up a river, likely the Pruth or Sereth.&#10;&#10;The Count sent invoices to Varna to deceive anyone trying to track his escape from England. He made arrangements for Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise, and for Petrof Skinsky to deal with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. The Czarina Catherine made a quick journey to Galatz, aided by Captain Donelson's superstition and canniness, which helped the Count avoid customs and the octroi. The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise, and the Count probably murdered him to eliminate any traces of his plans. The box is now somewhere on the water, moving along the river towards the castle."/>
<node id=" between what he did in London as part&#10;of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had&#10;to arrange as best he could.&#10;&#10;_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we&#10;know of, what he has done here.&#10;&#10;As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent&#10;invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of&#10;exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.&#10;The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel&#10;Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is&#10;also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but&#10;there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to&#10;Hildesheim.&#10;&#10;That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_&#10;made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's&#10;suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness&#10;played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind"/>
<node id="uspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness&#10;played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind&#10;through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the&#10;Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared&#10;the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here&#10;we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,&#10;moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been&#10;avoided.&#10;&#10;Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on&#10;land_, at Galatz.&#10;&#10;The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could&#10;appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to&#10;aid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing&#10;with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's&#10;remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general&#10;feeling against his class. The Count"/>
<node id="heim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi&#10;Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were&#10;pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little&#10;bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but&#10;important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling&#10;him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box&#10;which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to&#10;give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks&#10;who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by&#10;an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube&#10;International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to&#10;the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all&#10;he knew.&#10;&#10;We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his&#10;neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had"/>
<node id="; and the man's&#10;remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general&#10;feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.&#10;&#10;My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his&#10;castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from&#10;the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks&#10;who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.&#10;Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this&#10;service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he&#10;came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to&#10;arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and&#10;he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,&#10;by murdering his agent.&#10;&#10;I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the&#10;Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in&#10;the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling&#10;level with my"/>

We are on fire with&#10;anxiety and eagerness.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal._&#10;&#10;_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been&#10;ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since&#10;he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed&#10;much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the&#10;Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some&#10;sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two&#10;doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival&#10;of the _Czarina Catherine_.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_Later._--Lord Godal"/>
<node id=" Jonathan and his group found the Count in a wooden chest, lying on earth inside the chest. The Count was &quot;deathly pale, just like a waxen image,&quot; and his red eyes glared with a vindictive look. Upon seeing the sinking sun, the Count's reaction was one of hate, and his eyes saw the sinking sun. This information suggests that the Count is a vampire, and as a vampire, he cannot go out in the sunlight."/>
<node id=" hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was&#10;spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for&#10;as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,&#10;attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked&#10;the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the&#10;lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and&#10;the top of the box was thrown back.&#10;&#10;By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,&#10;and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made&#10;no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the&#10;shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count&#10;lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from&#10;the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen&#10;image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I&#10;knew too well.&#10;&#10;As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in"/>
<node id=" time; we&#10;shall, not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and&#10;we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.&quot; He looked at Jonathan as he&#10;spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was&#10;torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the&#10;boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...&#10;the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was&#10;silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you&#10;are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the&#10;last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has&#10;wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she&#10;will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as&#10;once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to&#10;fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of"/>
<node id="'s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all&#10;dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near&#10;that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be&#10;made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.&quot; Here&#10;Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,&#10;in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right&#10;into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or&#10;Hell!&quot; He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish&#10;infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every&#10;speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?&#10;Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?&quot; Here he turned to&#10;me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:&#10;&quot;Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us"/>
<node id=" his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:&#10;&quot;Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!&quot; and he sank&#10;down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he&#10;spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed&#10;us all:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful&#10;place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that&#10;place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not&#10;see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what&#10;is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in&#10;terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and&#10;subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then&#10;in time our dear one&quot;--he took my hand--&quot;would come to him to keep him&#10;company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have&#10;told us of their gloating lips"/>
<node id=" answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses&#10;and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing&#10;Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been&#10;upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,&#10;surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our&#10;parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly&#10;formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one&#10;shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the&#10;order.&#10;&#10;In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring&#10;of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was&#10;evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun&#10;should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the&#10;levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor&#10;the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their&#10;attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his&#10;purpose, seemed to"/>
<node id=" Lord Godalming's suggestion is to get a steam launch and follow the vampire count on the water. The current plan for the group's journey across the country between the river and the Carpathians involves dividing into several sub-groups to increase their chances of locating the count. Dr. Van Helsing, the professor, and Mina will take the 11:40 train to Veresti and get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. Lord Godalming and Jonathan will handle a steam launch and follow the count on the water. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward will ride horses on the bank, following the count in case he lands on the shore. Both Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward will have companions to help them manage the spare horses and to provide additional force if needed."/>
<node id=" for the crossing the country between the river and the&#10;Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at&#10;night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to&#10;make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to&#10;sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on&#10;watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging&#10;over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only&#10;comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would&#10;be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.&#10;Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;&#10;they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher&#10;lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following&#10;of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead&#10;their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When&#10;they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look"/>
<node id=" men when they are so earnest, and so true, and&#10;so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!&#10;What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do&#10;when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and&#10;that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing&#10;to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could&#10;not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within&#10;another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each&#10;of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam&#10;launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr. Seward&#10;and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have&#10;all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor&#10;Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,&#10;where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are&#10;bringing a good deal of ready money, as we"/>
<node id="go Pass. God guide and help them! I am&#10;afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we&#10;cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how&#10;Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless&#10;streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them&#10;are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible&#10;doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have&#10;met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see&#10;them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be&#10;necessary to take counsel together what to do next.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it&#10;if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the&#10;rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.&#10;Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;&#10;we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again"/>
<node id=" We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each&#10;party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did&#10;not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they&#10;seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower&#10;and lower on the mountain tops.&#10;&#10;Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind&#10;our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined&#10;that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our&#10;presence.&#10;&#10;All at once two voices shouted out to: &quot;Halt!&quot; One was my Jonathan's,&#10;raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute&#10;tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but&#10;there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were&#10;spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming&#10;and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the&#10;other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his&#10;horse like a cent"/>

I fear to think of her,&#10;off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we&#10;follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We&#10;have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only&#10;Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more&#10;Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing&#10;away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a&#10;cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly&#10;and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own&#10;feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of&#10;wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are&#10;"/>

Now we are on the track once again, and this time we&#10;may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on&#10;him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he&#10;is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry&#10;him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw&#10;him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,&#10;to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all&#10;shall do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall get a steam launch and follow him,&quot; said Lord Godalming.&#10;&#10;&quot;And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,&quot; said Mr.&#10;Morris.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good!&quot; said the Professor, &quot;both good.

<node id=" The Roumanian crew members wanted to throw overboard a box that was loaded by a peculiar old man before the ship set sail because they believed it was cursed with an &quot;evil eye.&quot; This belief is related to superstition and indicates their fear of the box bringing bad luck or harm to the ship and its crew.&#10;&#10;The skipper, however, decided not to comply with their request despite their grumblings for a few reasons. First, he wanted to protect the property and trust of the ship's owners. Second, he had already noticed that the box was marked &quot;Galatz via Varna,&quot; so he decided to keep it on board until they reached their destination and could get rid of it there.

At first I inclined to slack off sail&#10;and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the&#10;Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it&#10;whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our&#10;miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who&#10;had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no&#10;hinderin' him.&quot; This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition&#10;and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and&#10;he know when he meet his match!&quot; The skipper was not displeased with the&#10;compliment, and went on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,&#10;the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had&#10;been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started&#10;"/>

They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to&#10;fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it&#10;lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We&#10;didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;&#10;but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came&#10;aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box&#10;"/>

I sent them aboot&#10;their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I&#10;felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was&#10;agin the big box.

With every boat which we&#10;have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every&#10;deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose&#10;to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,&#10;going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This&#10;was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the&#10;boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu&#10;we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the&#10;night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell&#10;upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he&#10;shall keep the first watch.

<node id=" The speaker, Mina Harker, and her husband's friend, Professor Van Helsing, embarked on a journey towards the east to meet Mina's husband, Jonathan, who was coming from that direction. The horses accompanying them were behaving in a terrified manner, whinnying and cowering, as if they were in pain. This reflected the speakers' experience during the trip, as they were traveling through a desolate area with heavy rugs and provisions, and the horses' fear may have been caused by the harsh weather conditions or Mina's &quot;horrible fears&quot; and &quot;terrible anxiety&quot; about Jonathan's safety. Additionally, Mina mentions that she sees &quot;shadowy glimpses&quot; of the women who had tried to kiss Jonathan, which may have contributed to the eerie and frightening atmosphere of the journey."/>

If I thought that the Count's power&#10;over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be&#10;a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did&#10;speak, her words were enigmatical:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.

She said no more, even&#10;in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from&#10;the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was&#10;all alert.

I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of&#10;the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and&#10;all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's&#10;horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist&#10;began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy&#10;glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses&#10;cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even&#10;the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I&#10;feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and&#10;circled round.

<node id=" The vampire could be referring to the river that flows near his castle, possibly the Pruth or Sereth, when he mentioned being on the water. This information is crucial because it suggests that the vampire has already set his plan in motion and is currently in transit to his castle via the river. In London, the vampire made arrangements to ensure a safe and secret return to his castle. He used Slovaks to transport his box, instructed Skinsky to arrange for the carriage of the box up the river, and ultimately murdered Skinsky to cover his tracks. The vampire's familiarity with the waterway and his careful planning indicate that he is a formidable and cunning adversary."/>
<node id=" night; but what would he be, if&#10;left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not&#10;what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.&#10;&#10;3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most&#10;danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even&#10;then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were&#10;he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would&#10;indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were&#10;unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would&#10;still be desperate.&#10;&#10;We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do&#10;is to ascertain _what_ water.&#10;&#10;The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,&#10;then, get a light on what his later task is to be.&#10;&#10;_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part&#10;of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had&#10;to arrange as best he could."/>
<node id=" Based on the text provided, it is likely that the Slovaks used the Sereth river to transport the Count's box upstream after the Count murdered his agent to cover his tracks. This is suggested by the Count's familiarity with the waterway and his careful planning, as well as the fact that the Sereth is joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass, making it &quot;manifestly as close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.&quot;"/>
<node id=" either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in&#10;the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling&#10;level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,&#10;was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or&#10;poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There&#10;would be no such sound if floating down stream.&#10;&#10;Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may&#10;possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more&#10;easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza&#10;which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as&#10;close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal--continued._&#10;&#10;When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.

<node id=" Based on the text provided, the Count likely took a river route to return to his castle, specifically the Sereth river. He made arrangements in London to ensure a safe and secret return to his castle, using Slovaks to transport his box. He instructed Skinsky, who had connections to the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port, to arrange for the carriage of the box up the river. After the Count's box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he would come out from his box and give instructions to Skinsky. It is likely that the Slovaks used the Sereth river to transport the Count's box upstream after the Count murdered Skinsky to cover his tracks. The Sereth river is the most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended, as it is joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass, making it close to Dracula's castle. The Count's familiarity with the waterway and his careful planning indicate that he is a formidable and cunning adversary."/>
<node id=" When Mina woke up from her sleep in the castle, she was looking thin, pale, and weak. As for the Count's victims, after Jonathan cut off their heads with a knife, their bodies began to melt away and crumble into dust, as if the death that should have come centuries ago had finally asserted itself. Jonathan also made sure to fix the entrances of the castle so that the Count could never enter again in his undead form."/>

For, friend John, hardly had my knife&#10;severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and&#10;crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come&#10;centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud &quot;I&#10;am here!&quot;&#10;&#10;Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can&#10;the Count enter there Un-Dead.&#10;&#10;When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her&#10;sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come!&quot; she said, &quot;come away from this awful place!

But all was indeed changed; the frowning&#10;mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a&#10;steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell&#10;of in his diary.

<node id=" Based on the information provided in Dr. Seward's diary, Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have been traveling for three days on horseback, following the river and keeping a lookout for the vampire count. They have been making good time and are both holding up well, but there has been no sign of the count yet. They hope to see the count or catch up with Lord Godalming and Jonathan in their steam launch before they reach Strasba, so they can all decide on their next course of action together. At this point, it is unclear whether they will be able to catch up with the count before any further action needs to be taken."/>

There&#10;must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and&#10;rough, and he carries rude arms.&quot; All the men smiled, for amongst them&#10;they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and&#10;there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other&#10;precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could&#10;not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.&quot; Dr.&#10;Seward said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt&#10;together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come&#10;along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the&#10;Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry&#10;guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we&#10;shall, not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and&#10;we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.&quot;"/>
<node id=" The pursued animals, who were being chased by a group of men and wolves, were failing to realize the danger of their situation as the sun set. This is because they did not seem to notice or be concerned about the men and wolves closing in on them, and were continuing on their path with &quot;manifest singleness of purpose.&quot; The wind, which was blowing from the north, was also a significant factor, as it indicated that the snow clouds were being driven away and the sun was shining more brightly as it sank towards the mountain tops. This meant that the visibility was improving and the pursuers would be able to see the pursued more clearly. Despite this, the pursued did not seem to realize the urgency of their situation and the need to take action to protect themselves."/>

At times we could not see an arm's length before us;&#10;but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to&#10;clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of&#10;late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew&#10;with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the&#10;sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less&#10;than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various&#10;bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer&#10;and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly&#10;had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,&#10;the snow fell.

When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.&#10;It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,&#10;and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down&#10;towards the far mountain tops.

The snow was now falling&#10;more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning&#10;to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the&#10;snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we&#10;were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the&#10;white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in&#10;kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far&#10;off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a&#10;group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a&#10;long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail&#10;wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the&#10;snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were&#10;peasants"/>

The rough roadway still led downwards; we&#10;could trace it through the drifted snow.&#10;&#10;In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined&#10;him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,&#10;with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the&#10;hand and drew me in: &quot;See!&quot; he said, &quot;here you will be in shelter; and&#10;if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.&quot; He brought in our&#10;furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and&#10;forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was&#10;repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could&#10;not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not&#10;reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top&#10;of the rock, and began to search the horizon.

They suspect the crossing point to be located somewhere near or after Galatz, as suggested by the information gathered during Mrs. Harker's trance, which indicated that the Count's ship might have been damaged and stopped or delayed near that area. The group, including Jonathan and Lord Godalming, is preparing to depart as soon as possible after the _Czarina Catherine_ arrives in Galatz."/>
<node id=" To ensure that the vampire is unable to escape ashore and will be discovered by customs officials if not, the group can take the following steps:&#10;&#10;1. Keep a close watch on the vampire's ship: By following the ship on a steam launch, Jonathan and Lord Godalming can prevent the vampire from jumping or flying ashore at night. They can also alert customs officials if the ship approaches the shore during the day.&#10;&#10;2. Alert customs officials: The group should inform customs officials about the vampire's ship and the possibility that it may contain illegal goods. Customs officials can then take appropriate measures to inspect the ship and its contents.&#10;&#10;3. Ensure the vampire's ship is carried by customs officials: If the vampire's ship is carried by customs officials, he will not be able to escape ashore undetected. Customs officials can inspect the ship and its contents, and can take appropriate action if they find any illegal goods.&#10;&#10;4. Prevent the vampire from changing his form: The vampire is known to have the ability to change his form, which he may use to escape ashore. The group can prevent this by keeping a close watch on the vampire and his ship, and by taking measures to ensure that he cannot leave the ship undetected.&#10;&#10;5. Destroy the vampire: If the group is able to locate the vampire, they can take steps to destroy him. This will prevent him from returning to his castle and carrying out any further harm."/>

She bustled off to get&#10;tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his&#10;earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie&#10;hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do&#10;not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be&#10;in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did&#10;at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he&#10;be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men&#10;may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on&#10;shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.&#10;We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come&#10;on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his&#10;true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered"/>
<node id=" During the cold hour, Mina Harker took measures to comfort the horses by quieting them with her touch and feeding them. She also kept the fire going by stepping forth to replenish it when it began to die, despite the snow and chill mist. She felt a sense of safety in the ring where she stood and thought that her fears and anxieties were causing her to imagine things. She also held onto the Wafer, a protective measure, which made her feel secure. The horses eventually calmed down and the horrid figures melted away with the dawn."/>
<node id=". I rejoiced, for I knew that what she&#10;could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be&#10;danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!&#10;&#10;Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I&#10;came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they&#10;whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a&#10;time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to&#10;the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was&#10;with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was&#10;about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying&#10;sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of&#10;some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the&#10;snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with&#10;trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses&#10;whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I"/>

They could not&#10;approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within&#10;the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The&#10;horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on&#10;them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor&#10;beasts no more of terror.&#10;&#10;And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the&#10;snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but&#10;when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.&#10;At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the&#10;whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away&#10;towards the castle, and were lost.&#10;&#10;Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned"/>
<node id=" Jonathan, driven by impetuosity and a single-minded purpose, managed to overawe the pursuing Szgany and wolves by his determined actions. He jumped onto the cart, displayed incredible strength in raising and flinging the great box over the wheel to the ground. During this time, Mr. Morris had been forcefully making his way through the Szgany on the other side of the ring.&#10;&#10;While Jonathan was successful in his urgent action, Mr. Morris sustained an injury in the process. As he finally broke through the Szgany ring, he was clutching his side with his left hand, with blood spurting through his fingers. The text does not provide specific details about how the injury occurred, but it can be inferred that Mr. Morris was cut or stabbed by a knife while fighting his way through the Szgany."/>
<node id=" the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their&#10;attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his&#10;purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they&#10;cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the&#10;cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great&#10;box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.&#10;Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of&#10;Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,&#10;with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had&#10;seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and&#10;they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first&#10;I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang&#10;beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that&#10;with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was&#10;spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for&#10;as Jonathan"/>

Those who were unmounted jumped upon the&#10;leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,&#10;which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving&#10;us alone.&#10;&#10;Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his&#10;hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I&#10;flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the&#10;two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his&#10;head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand&#10;in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of&#10;my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!&quot; he cried&#10;suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, &quot;It was&#10;worth for this to die! Look! look!&quot;&#10;&#10;The sun was now"/>
<node id=" The challenge or danger in searching for a vampire's grave is that the vampire is a formidable and cunning adversary who can use their beauty and fascination to hypnotize and lure their victims. As we can see in the narrative, the protagonist feels a strong fascination for the vampire, which makes him shudder as if he is about to commit murder. He also notes that many men who set out to do such a task as his have their hearts fail them, and they end up becoming victims themselves. This highlights the danger of underestimating the vampire's power and charm, which can lead to dire consequences.&#10;&#10;If a person is unable to resist the vampire's beauty and fascination, they could face the consequence of becoming a vampire themselves. In the narrative, the protagonist mentions that if he were to succumb to the vampire's charm, he would become one more victim in the vampire's fold, swelling the ranks of the Un-Dead. This suggests that the vampire's beauty and fascination are tools that he uses to increase his power and control over others. Therefore, it is crucial to resist the vampire's allure and take measures to destroy him, as the group plans to do."/>

Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when&#10;such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,&#10;found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,&#10;and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the&#10;wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset&#10;come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair&#10;woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a&#10;kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire&#10;fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...&#10;&#10;There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence&#10;of such an one, even lying as she lay in"/>

<node id=" The vampire could have been referring to the River Sereth when he described the safest way for him to travel. This is suggested by the fact that he had made arrangements in London for Slovaks to transport his box, and Skinsky, who had connections to Slovaks who traded down the river to the port, was instructed to arrange for the carriage of the box up the river. The Sereth river is the most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended, as it is joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass, making it close to Dracula's castle.&#10;&#10;This detail is important in understanding his later actions because the vampire is powerless on water during the day and can only summon fog, storm, snow, and his wolves. If he were wrecked, the living water would engulf him, and he would be lost. Therefore, he would need to ensure that he reaches land, preferably friendly land where he is free to move. The fact that he chose a river route indicates that he is familiar with the waterway and has carefully planned his return to his castle, taking into account his limitations and vulnerabilities during daytime and on water."/>
<node id=" The individuals in the group are making various necessary preparations and gathering resources for their expedition to pursue the vampire count. These preparations include:&#10;&#10;1. A steam launch for Lord Godalming and Jonathan to handle, which they will use to follow the count's ship on the water.&#10;2. Horses for Mr. Morris, Dr. Seward, and their companions to ride, which they will use to follow the count on land.&#10;3. Maps and other necessary appliances to help them navigate the country between the river and the Carpathians.&#10;4. A carriage to take Dr. Van Helsing, Mina, and their luggage from Veresti to the Borgo Pass.&#10;5. Ready money for expenses during the journey.&#10;&#10;The availability of money plays a crucial role in their ability to set off promptly and well-equipped. Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris, who are wealthy, are willing to spend their money freely to finance the expedition. This allows the group to acquire the necessary resources and equipment quickly and efficiently, ensuring that they can depart as soon as possible. The money also provides a safety net, allowing the group to purchase additional supplies or make alternate arrangements if necessary. In short, the group's access to financial resources enables them to mount an effective and well-resourced expedition, increasing their chances of locating and neutralizing the vampire count."/>
<node id=" In preparation for the approaching night, Dr. Van Helsing decided to use his hypnotic power to help the group navigate to the Count's location, which was unknown to them. He believed this was necessary due to the Count's formidable nature, as he was strong, subtle, and cunning. Van Helsing also wanted to sanctify other places and destroy the Count's nest of vampires.&#10;&#10;Regarding Mina, Van Helsing thought it best to keep her away from &quot;that awful place&quot; because of her vulnerable state. Mina had been tainted by the Count's &quot;devil's illness,&quot; and Van Helsing feared that exposing her to the Count's lair could put her in grave danger. He wanted to protect Mina from the Count's hypnotic power and the terrifying experiences that the others had to endure in that place.&#10;&#10;In his diary, Van Helsing expressed concern about Mina's health during the travel, noting that she looked &quot;more healthy and more redder than before,&quot; which made him uneasy.

They divided into several sub-groups to increase their chances of locating the count. Lord Godalming and Jonathan would handle a steam launch and follow the count on the water, while Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward would ride horses on the bank, following the count in case he landed on the shore. Dr. Van Helsing and Mina would take the 11:40 train to Veresti and get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.&#10;&#10;During this time, Mina mentioned that she saw &quot;shadowy glimpses&quot; of the women who had tried to kiss Jonathan, which may have contributed to the eerie and frightening atmosphere of the journey.&#10;&#10;Overall, Dr. Van Helsing made preparations for the approaching night by planning to use his hypnotic power to help the group navigate to the Count's location and destroy his nest of vampires. Mina, who had been tainted by the Count's &quot;devil's illness,&quot; was kept away from &quot;that awful place&quot; for her own safety."/>
<node id=" Van Helsing's proposal for finding and disabling Dracula involves using his own hypnotic power to help the group navigate to the Count's location, which is unknown to them. He believes this is necessary because the Count is a formidable opponent who is strong, subtle, and cunning. Van Helsing also wants to sanctify other places and obliterate the Count's nest of vampires.&#10;&#10;Regarding Mina, Van Helsing is concerned about her vulnerable state as she has been tainted by the Count's &quot;devil's illness.&quot; He fears that exposing her to the Count's lair could put her in grave danger. However, he also recognizes that Mina has a unique connection to the Count through her hypnotic susceptibility to him. Van Helsing plans to use this connection to their advantage, hoping that Mina's hypnotic power can assist in finding and disabling Dracula.&#10;&#10;The group makes various necessary preparations for this expedition, including acquiring a steam launch, horses, maps, and other necessary appliances. They divide into several sub-groups to increase their chances of locating the count, with Dr. Van Helsing and Mina taking the 11:40 train to Veresti and getting a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.

<node id=" Dr. Van Helsing is proposing to take a multi-pronged approach against the Count. This includes using his hypnotic powers to help navigate to the Count's location, sanctifying other places, and obliterating the Count's nest of vampires. He believes it's necessary to keep Mina away from the Count's lair due to her vulnerable state, having been tainted by his &quot;devil's illness.&quot;&#10;&#10;He is offering Jonathan the opportunity to play a key role in the plan because he recognizes Jonathan's desire for revenge against the Count, who has caused significant harm to him and his loved ones. Additionally, as a young and brave individual, Jonathan's energies may be needed in the final confrontation. Dr. Van Helsing also acknowledges that it is Jonathan's right to be the one to destroy the Count, given the suffering he has endured."/>
<node id=" As Jonathan and Professor Van Helsing walked away from Dracula's castle, they stopped after about a mile due to Jonathan's fatigue. From this distance, they could see the castle's clear outline against the sky, perched atop a sheer precipice and situated a thousand feet above the surrounding terrain. The angle of perspective created a significant gap between the castle and the adjacent mountain on any side, highlighting its isolated and intimidating position.&#10;&#10;The area around the castle was a wild and desolate landscape, with signs of distant howling wolves. The sound of their howls, although muffled by the snowfall, still evoked a sense of terror. This eerie atmosphere further emphasized the castle's ominous presence and the challenges that awaited them in their pursuit of the vampire count."/>

Then we looked back and saw where the&#10;clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under&#10;the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the&#10;Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,&#10;perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with&#10;seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain&#10;on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We&#10;could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the&#10;sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was&#10;full of terror.

He also notes that many men who set out to do such a task as his have their hearts fail them, and they end up becoming victims themselves. This highlights the danger of underestimating the vampire's power and charm, which can lead to dire consequences.&#10;&#10;If a person is unable to resist the vampire's beauty and fascination, they could face the consequence of becoming a vampire themselves.

But I could not eat; to even try to do so was&#10;repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could&#10;not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not&#10;reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top&#10;of the rock, and began to search the horizon.

Horses for Mr. Morris, Dr. Seward, and their companions to ride, which they will use to follow the count on land.&#10;3.

The money also provides a safety net, allowing the group to purchase additional supplies or make alternate arrangements if necessary. In short, the group's access to financial resources enables them to mount an effective and well-resourced expedition, increasing their chances of locating and neutralizing the vampire count.">

This is suggested by the fact that he had made arrangements in London for Slovaks to transport his box, and Skinsky, who had connections to Slovaks who traded down the river to the port, was instructed to arrange for the carriage of the box up the river. The Sereth river is the most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended, as it is joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass, making it close to Dracula's castle.&#10;&#10;This detail is important in understanding his later actions because the vampire is powerless on water during the day and can only summon fog, storm, snow, and his wolves. If he were wrecked, the living water would engulf him, and he would be lost. Therefore, he would need to ensure that he reaches land, preferably friendly land where he is free to move. The fact that he chose a river route indicates that he is familiar with the waterway and has carefully planned his return to his castle, taking into account his limitations and vulnerabilities during daytime and on water.">

Van Helsing also wanted to sanctify other places and destroy the Count's nest of vampires.&#10;&#10;Regarding Mina, Van Helsing thought it best to keep her away from &quot;that awful place&quot; because of her vulnerable state.

They divided into several sub-groups to increase their chances of locating the count. Lord Godalming and Jonathan would handle a steam launch and follow the count on the water, while Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward would ride horses on the bank, following the count in case he landed on the shore. Dr. Van Helsing and Mina would take the 11:40 train to Veresti and get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.&#10;&#10;During this time, Mina mentioned that she saw &quot;shadowy glimpses&quot; of the women who had tried to kiss Jonathan, which may have contributed to the eerie and frightening atmosphere of the journey.&#10;&#10;Overall, Dr. Van Helsing made preparations for the approaching night by planning to use his hypnotic power to help the group navigate to the Count's location and destroy his nest of vampires. Mina, who had been tainted by the Count's &quot;devil's illness,&quot; was kept away from &quot;that awful place&quot; for her own safety.">

He believes it's necessary to keep Mina away from the Count's lair due to her vulnerable state, having been tainted by his &quot;devil's illness.&quot;&#10;&#10;He is offering Jonathan the opportunity to play a key role in the plan because he recognizes Jonathan's desire for revenge against the Count, who has caused significant harm to him and his loved ones. Additionally, as a young and brave individual, Jonathan's energies may be needed in the final confrontation.

Then we looked back and saw where the&#10;clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under&#10;the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the&#10;Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,&#10;perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with&#10;seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain&#10;on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We&#10;could hear the distant howling of wolves.

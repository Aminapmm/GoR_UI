    <node id=" In the narrative, the speaker, Mr. Rochester, is expressing his desire for Jane's spirit and personality, rather than just her physical presence. He uses the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point. Even if he could capture the bird, he cannot truly tame or possess its spirit. Similarly, he wants more from Jane than just her physical presence; he wants her love, loyalty, and companionship. This is evident when he says, &quot;Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.&quot; Here, Mr. Rochester acknowledges that trying to force Jane to stay or love him would be futile, as he cannot capture her spirit. Instead, he must hope that she chooses to stay with him of her own volition." />

Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking&#10;out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.&#10;Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful&#10;creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only&#10;let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate&#10;would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay&#10;dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue&#10;and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.

But before I go on, tell me what you&#10;mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;&#10;and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I&#10;don't very well know why.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean,--What next?

There was such deep&#10;remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his&#10;manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and&#10;mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my&#10;heart's core.&#10;&#10;&quot;You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?&quot; ere long he inquired&#10;wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,&#10;the result rather of weakness than of will.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot: I am tired and sick.

Not a human being&#10;that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him&#10;who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and&#10;idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--&quot;Depart!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, you understand what I want of you?

    <node id=" The relationship between the narrator, Mr. Rochester, and Bertha Mason is described as one filled with &quot;hideous and degrading agonies&quot; due to her intemperate and unchaste behavior. Despite her vices, Mr. Rochester chose not to use cruelty to check her behavior because he believed that only cruelty could control such strong propensities. This suggests that Mr. Rochester is a compassionate person who prefers to avoid resorting to harsh methods, even in difficult circumstances. Additionally, using cruelty would not have resolved the underlying issue of Bertha's insanity, which was discovered by doctors after four years of living with her. The relationship became unbearable for Mr. Rochester, as he could not legally separate from Bertha due to her mental state, leaving him trapped in a miserable marriage." />

I lived with that woman upstairs four&#10;years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character&#10;ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast&#10;and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would&#10;not use cruelty.

I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a&#10;nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with&#10;mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not&#10;rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered&#10;that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs&#10;of insanity.

Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate&#10;exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast&#10;through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;&#10;but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and&#10;put his aside.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!--How is this?&quot; he exclaimed hastily.  &quot;Oh, I know! you won't kiss&#10;the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces&#10;appropriated?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, Jane?

I&#10;must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner&#10;betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old&#10;acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made&#10;inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned&#10;from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty&#10;thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to&#10;Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.

That was my&#10;Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me&#10;much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to&#10;approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.&#10;The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a&#10;man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,&#10;and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an&#10;Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly&#10;handsome.

    <node id=" The &quot;arbitress of my life&quot; that offered help during Mesrour's accident is not explicitly identified, but based on the context, it appears to be a metaphor for the speaker's inner guide or conscience. This is further supported by the fact that the speaker feels a sense of authority and freshness after accepting its help.&#10;&#10;Yes, Jane came home that night after the incident. The speaker, Mr. Rochester, reveals that he heard her come home but did not let her know that he was aware of it." />

It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to&#10;bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it&#10;stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort&#10;of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.&#10;&#10;&quot;When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap&#10;and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf&#10;must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could&#10;not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind&#10;the dim hedge, without singular regret.

Then came a&#10;deep, strong sob.&#10;&#10;I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as&#10;determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face&#10;from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my&#10;hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;God bless you, my dear master!&quot; I said.  &quot;God keep you from harm and&#10;wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,&quot; he answered;&#10;&quot;without it," />
    <node id=" The speaker, Mr. Rochester, insists on keeping Jane at Thornfield for one more night because he wants to cherish and appreciate her presence before she leaves. He acknowledges that he has hurt her by concealing his marriage and deceived her, and he feels guilty about it. By allowing Jane to stay one more night, he hopes to make amends for his wrongdoings and express his love for her. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester wants to ensure that Jane is well-rested and in good health before she embarks on her journey to begin a new life elsewhere. He offers to care for her during her illness or anger, indicating his deep concern and affection for her well-being." />

It was not&#10;my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.

    <node id="1. The narrator, Mr. Rochester, reflects on his physical state and realizes that he has not eaten or drunk anything that day due to his preoccupation with his thoughts and emotions. This physical discomfort is a consequence of his Conscience turning tyrant and holding Passion by the throat, leading him to become so absorbed in his inner turmoil that he forgets to take care of his basic needs.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester also becomes aware of his emotional isolation, as he recognizes that no one has checked on him or asked after his well-being during his time in seclusion. This realization further highlights the impact of his Conscience's tyranny, as it has led him to neglect not only his physical needs but also his relationships with others.&#10;3. The turmoil within Mr. Rochester's mind has caused him to question his own judgment and moral compass, leading him to contemplate actions that he had previously deemed unacceptable. This internal conflict results from the tyranny of his Conscience, which creates a sense of guilt and fear that clouds his ability to make clear decisions.&#10;4. The metaphor of Mr. Rochester's Conscience turning tyrant and holding Passion by the throat also highlights the struggle between reason and emotion within his mind. By recognizing this internal conflict, Mr. Rochester gains a better understanding of himself and his motivations, allowing him to make more informed decisions in the future." />

    <node id="1. The refreshing wind from Europe and the purifying storm: The fresh wind and the storm that broke and thundered over the ocean signify a change in Jane's circumstances and her emotional state. These natural elements help renew her spirit and clear her mind, allowing her to gain a new perspective on her life.&#10;&#10;2. The garden and nature: Walking through her garden amongst the blooming orange-trees, pomegranates, and pineapples exposes Jane to growth, beauty, and the cycle of life. This natural setting provides her with hope for regeneration and renewal.&#10;&#10;3. The memory of Bertha Mason: Recalling Mr. Rochester's first wife, who was driven to madness by their father's deceit and being hidden away in Thornfield Hall, helps Jane understand the importance of making an informed decision about her own future and avoiding a similar fate.&#10;&#10;4. The realization of true love: Jane is absolutely worshipped by Mr. Rochester, and she experiences a profound connection with him. However, she knows that their relationship cannot be based on deceit and must end to protect them both from the consequences of such a union. This understanding contributes to her renewed sense of hope as she sees an opportunity for regeneration and a new beginning.&#10;&#10;5. The supportive presence of Mrs. Fairfax: Although not explicitly mentioned, Jane's relationship with Mrs. Fairfax has been an essential source of support throughout the novel. Their bond has allowed Jane to develop her own sense of identity, and their mutual respect helps give Jane the courage and strength to make difficult decisions.&#10;&#10;6. Mr. Rochester's transparency: After Jane refuses his proposal, Mr. Rochester tells her about his past, including his original intentions to marry Bertha Mason openly and honestly. This level of honesty encourages a sense of trust between them and helps Jane see him in a more positive light, further contributing to her newfound hope and the belief that regeneration is possible." />
    <node id="alloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design&#10;of self-destruction, was past in a second.&#10;&#10;&quot;A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open&#10;casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew&#10;pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the&#10;dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched&#10;pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics&#10;kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true&#10;Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to&#10;follow.&#10;&#10;&quot;The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,&#10;and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up&#10;and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living&#10;blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.&#10;I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.

    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,&#10;which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer&#10;it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is&#10;a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant&#10;contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,&#10;Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this&#10;moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your&#10;heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,&#10;my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very&#10;natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter&#10;have free advent--my arms wait to receive her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was&#10;all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I&#10;was doubtless covered with grimy dishon" />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Mr. Rochester, is prevented from complying with the man's request to live together due to his sense of honor and integrity. He had previously declared that he could not change his marital status, and he feels guilty about deceiving Jane. Additionally, he believes that breaking a human law and living with Mr. Rochester would harm no one.&#10;2. However, the speaker's conscience, reason, and feeling all urge her to comply with the man's request due to concerns for his well-being. The speaker feels torn between her own moral compass and her desire to help the man.&#10;3. Ultimately, the speaker's commitment to honesty and integrity prevents her from complying with the man's request, despite the emotional pull she feels to do so." />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Mr. Rochester reveals to Jane that he did indeed have an older brother named Rowland, and his father was described as an avaricious and grasping man. Seeking to keep the family's property intact, Mr. Rochester's father planned for him to marry a wealthy woman, Miss Mason, who had a fortune of thirty thousand pounds. This marriage would ensure that at least one of his sons remained financially comfortable.&#10;&#10;However, upon meeting Mr. Mason in Jamaica and becoming acquainted with his family, Mr. Rochester discovered that his prospective bride's mother was infamous and that her daughter shared some of her worst traits. Despite this knowledge, he went through with the marriage, only to find that Bertha Mason, his new wife, was intemperate and unchaste. This union brought forth a series of curses as Mr. Rochester's life became intertwined with hers.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it was revealed that Mr. Rochester's father had intended for most of the family fortune to go to Rowland, leaving little for Mr. Rochester himself. This led him to marry into wealth through his union with Bertha Mason, which ultimately proved disastrous." />
    <node id=" me!&quot; burst involuntarily from my lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a fool!&quot; cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  &quot;I keep telling her I am&#10;not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing&#10;of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my&#10;infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in&#10;opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,&#10;Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove&#10;you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the&#10;case.  Can you listen to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; for hours if you will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the&#10;eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have understood something to that effect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane," />
    <node id=" the weekly house accounts to make up, or&#10;something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting&#10;out of my sight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my&#10;presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was&#10;yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the&#10;room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly&#10;dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full&#10;of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your&#10;air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,&#10;but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making&#10;herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet&#10;when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your&#10;interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you&#10;gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.&#10;Very soon you seemed to get used to me" />
    <node id="1. The protagonist, Jane, does not directly respond to Mr. Rochester's accusation but instead expresses her feelings through physical symptoms, such as faintness and difficulty speaking. She also reveals that she is thinking about how to act, indicating that she is considering complying with his request despite her moral objections. However, she ultimately remains silent on the matter, and Mr. Rochester recognizes that she is not ready to accuse or revile him." />
    <node id=" you would reply.--I guess&#10;rightly?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard&#10;me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating&#10;disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,&#10;and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to&#10;that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,&#10;and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you&#10;cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the&#10;flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke&#10;much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:&#10;you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I&#10;know you--I am on my guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, I do not wish to act against you,&quot; I said; and my unsteady voice&#10;warned me to curtail my sentence.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not in" />

It&#10;was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract&#10;it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began&#10;singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds&#10;were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and&#10;frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from&#10;self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had&#10;injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I&#10;could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my&#10;own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled&#10;the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,&#10;fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,&#10;extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some" />
    <node id=" The speaker, Mr. Rochester, chooses to walk down an unfamiliar road and avoid reflecting on the past or future because he is in a state of turmoil after his plans have been disrupted by Jane's rejection of his proposal and the revelation of his marriage. By avoiding familiar roads and sights, he is attempting to escape from the painful memories and associations that are tied to his past at Thornfield Hall.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mr. Rochester mentions that he had been &quot;corroded with disappointment&quot; and regarded the notion of a faithful and loving woman as a mere dream, indicating that he was disillusioned and skeptical about the possibility of finding true love. Therefore, he walks down an unfamiliar road to avoid thinking about his romantic prospects or any potential future relationships.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester's decision to ignore the beauty of the surrounding nature is consistent with his state of mind at the time. He is preoccupied with his own thoughts and emotions, making it difficult for him to appreciate or notice the natural world around him. This reflects his inner turmoil and emotional distress, as he struggles to come to terms with his situation and make sense of his feelings." />
    <node id=" you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are&#10;looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to&#10;the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame&#10;of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with&#10;disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against&#10;all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,&#10;faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came&#10;back to England.&#10;&#10;&quot;On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.&#10;Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in&#10;Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as&#10;negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no&#10;presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the&#10;arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble&#10;guise.  I did not know it, even when" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester deceived Jane about his marital status due to his initial plan of marrying a wealthy woman, Miss Mason, to ensure financial stability for himself, as his father had intended most of the family fortune to go to his older brother Rowland. However, after discovering that Bertha Mason shared her mother's infamous traits and exhibited intemperate and unchaste behavior, he went through with the marriage out of a sense of honor and integrity, despite knowing it was a mistake.&#10;&#10;He ultimately chose to reveal the truth and propose marriage to Jane because his conscience, reason, and feelings all urged him to comply with her request for honesty. He realized that his deception had hurt Jane deeply, and he wanted to make amends by expressing his love for her and ensuring she was well-rested and in good health before departing from Thornfield Hall.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Rochester's initial deception towards Jane was motivated by a desire to maintain financial stability and a sense of honor, while his decision to reveal the truth and propose marriage stemmed from a commitment to honesty and integrity, as well as a desire to make amends for his wrongdoings and express his love for Jane." />
    <node id=" The &quot;arbitress of my life,&quot; as referred to in the passage, is a metaphor for the speaker's inner guide or conscience. It offered help during Mesrour's accident, which is not a real person but a horse that belongs to the speaker, Mr. Rochester. The guidance left a sense of authority because it spoke and acted with a certain command, and regret upon its departure because it was familiar and dear to the speaker, having been a part of his inner world or &quot;house down below.&quot; This interpretation is supported by the text's description of the guide as a &quot;strange perseverance&quot; and &quot;a sort of authority,&quot; as well as the speaker's feeling that he must be aided by that hand." />
    <node id=" The ideal woman that Mr. Rochester searched for in various cities and social circles for ten years was one who could contrast with Bertha Mason, his first wife, and be a good and intelligent woman whom he could love. He describes this woman as the antipodes of the Creole, indicating that he wanted someone who was her opposite in temperament and behavior. Despite having plenty of money and access to various social circles, Mr. Rochester could not find this ideal woman who would understand his case and accept him despite being burdened with a curse. He eventually realized that Jane, with her lively spirit and personality, was the one he had been searching for all along." />

Provided with plenty of money and the&#10;passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were&#10;closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,&#10;French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not&#10;find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,&#10;heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:&#10;but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired&#10;perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited&#10;me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them&#10;all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings" />
    <node id=" The speaker, Jane, began to cry upon taking hold of the man's (Mr. Rochester's) hand in the canoe because she was struggling with her emotions and had been holding back her tears for some time. She felt torn between her own moral compass, which urged her not to comply with Mr. Rochester's request to live together, and her desire to help him despite his passionate pleas.&#10;&#10;When Jane began to cry, Mr. Rochester earnestly entreatied her to be composed. He assured her that he was not angry but rather loved her too well. He was moved by the sight of her pale face with a resolute and frozen look, which prompted him to beg her to wipe her eyes.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester responded to Jane's tears with concern and affection, trying to soothe and comfort her while also expressing his love for her." />
    <node id="perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of&#10;his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,&#10;soothingly--&#10;&#10;&quot;Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to&#10;say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.&quot;&#10;&#10;He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been&#10;struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress&#10;them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I&#10;considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.&#10;If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried&#10;heartily.&#10;&#10;Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could&#10;not while he was in such a passion.&#10;&#10;&quot;But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled&#10;your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not&#10;endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes" />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Mr. Rochester, is testing Jane's opinion of him and trying to gauge her level of trust in him by asking if she thinks he is a &quot;plotting profligate&quot; and a &quot;base and low rake.&quot; He wants to see if she truly believes that he has been pretending to love her with the intention of manipulating her. Mr. Rochester asks this question knowing that Jane is still recovering from the shock of Mesrour's accident and is in no condition to have a lengthy or intense conversation. This shows that he is aware of her physical state and is using it to his advantage, as he knows that she will be less likely to defend him vigorously. Additionally, Mr. Rochester's use of sarcasm and exaggeration (&quot;simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid&quot;) further suggests that he is trying to provoke Jane and test her loyalty to him." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, Jane has several factors to consider before making her decision about what to do next. Firstly, she must weigh her moral objections against complying with Mr. Rochester's request to live together without being married. Secondly, she is aware that he recognizes her reluctance and is not ready for accusations or revilement, which suggests a need for understanding and patience from both parties.&#10;&#10;Considering Mr. Rochester's character, the narrative portrays him as a compassionate person who avoids harsh methods even in difficult circumstances. His relationship with Bertha Mason was filled with &quot;hideous and degrading agonies,&quot; yet he chose not to use cruelty to control her behavior due to her insanity, which was discovered after four years of living together. This information may help Jane understand the complexity of Mr. Rochester's situation and empathize with his struggles.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester has expressed his desire for Jane's spirit and personality rather than just her physical presence, using the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point. He wants more from Jane than just her physical companionship; he wants her love, loyalty, and companionship. This could suggest that he respects Jane's autonomy and would not force her into a decision against her will.&#10;&#10;In the morning, Mr. Rochester is restlessly pacing in his room and awaiting Jane's presence. She must decide whether to confront him about their moral disagreement or to stay silent and leave for her new life as planned. Considering all these factors, it would be reasonable for Jane to have an open and honest conversation with Mr. Rochester about her concerns while also expressing her affection and appreciation for his kindness towards her. This way, she can maintain her moral integrity while also addressing the emotional turmoil that both of them are experiencing due to their impending separation." />
    <node id=" The speaker, Mr. Rochester, is determined to uphold his principles and beliefs, which include honoring the law given by God and sanctioned by man, and holding to the principles he received when he was sane. He values laws and principles as inviolate and worthful, and believes they should be adhered to even in times of temptation or when it is inconvenient for him. Specifically, he refers to his sense of honor and integrity that prevents him from living together with Jane despite his strong desire to do so. He values his independence and self-respect, and would rather be alone than compromise his principles and beliefs." />
    <node id=" world cares for _you_? or&#10;who will be injured by what you do?&quot;&#10;&#10;Still indomitable was the reply--&quot;_I_ care for myself.  The more&#10;solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will&#10;respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I&#10;will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not&#10;mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there&#10;is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul&#10;rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they&#10;shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would&#10;be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I&#10;cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my&#10;veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its&#10;throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have&#10;at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.&quot;" />
    <node id=" The narrator, Jane, is experiencing intense emotional pain due to her moral objections to Mr. Rochester's request and her feelings for him. She wants to stay with him, but she cannot comply with his request, which goes against her principles. This inner conflict, combined with her love for Mr. Rochester, causes her physical symptoms, such as faintness and difficulty speaking. Despite her self-loathing and physical exhaustion, Jane's conscience (referred to as the &quot;arbitress of my life&quot;) prevents her from returning to Mr. Rochester, leading her to weep and eventually collapse from emotional stress." />
    <node id="1. The speaker's (Mr. Rochester's) intention in making the accusation is to test Jane's opinion of him and gauge her level of trust in him by asking if she thinks he is a &quot;plotting profligate&quot; and a &quot;base and low rake.&quot; He wants to see if she truly believes that he has been pretending to love her with the intention of manipulating her.&#10;2. The protagonist, Jane, being ill and unable to defend herself, responds to Mr. Rochester's accusation by expressing her feelings through physical symptoms such as faintness and difficulty speaking. She also reveals that she is thinking about how to act, indicating that she is considering complying with his request despite her moral objections. However, she ultimately remains silent on the matter, and Mr. Rochester recognizes that she is not ready to accuse or revile him. This shows that Jane values honesty and integrity over pleasing others, even if it means facing consequences for her actions." />
    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, Mr. Rochester is experiencing a complex mix of emotions towards Jane, including desire for her love, loyalty, and companionship, as well as guilt and fear due to his Conscience's tyranny. He tries to test Jane's opinion of him by making an accusation, but she responds with physical symptoms and moral objections, leading him to recognize that she is not ready to accuse or revile him.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester's actions towards Jane in this encounter involve using physical force to try to make her comply with his request, but he ultimately recognizes that it would be futile and releases her. His Conscience turning tyrant has caused him to question his own judgment and moral compass, leading him to become so absorbed in his inner turmoil that he forgets to take care of his basic needs.&#10;3. Jane's reaction to Mr. Rochester's physical force involves experiencing intense emotional pain due to her moral objections to his request and her feelings for him. She wants to stay with him, but she cannot comply with his request, which goes against her principles. This inner conflict, combined with her love for Mr. Rochester, causes her physical symptoms, such as faintness and difficulty speaking.

    <node id="The quiet little figure sitting by herself on a stile in Hay Lane is not explicitly identified as the &quot;arbitress of the narrator's life&quot; in the passage provided. However, based on the supporting materials and the context given in the narrative, it is suggested that this figure is an embodiment or a metaphor for the speaker's inner guide or conscience. The text describes how this figure waited there in humble guise, but the narrator did not recognize its significance until later, after accepting its help during Mesrour's accident. This interpretation is supported by the text's description of the guide as a &quot;strange perseverance&quot; and &quot;a sort of authority,&quot; which influenced the speaker's decisions and left a sense of regret upon its departure. The exact identity of this figure is not explicitly revealed, allowing for different interpretations based on the context provided in the narrative." />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre is sneaking out of Thornfield Hall in the middle of the night because she has decided to leave her position as a governess at the estate. She has packed a parcel with some personal belongings, has twenty shillings for her journey, and carries her slippers to put on once she's safely away from the house. She bids farewell to Mrs. Fairfax and Adele in her thoughts, as she doesn't want to risk waking them up or drawing attention to herself while leaving." />

I&#10;rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew&#10;where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking&#10;these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester&#10;had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it&#10;was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I&#10;made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I&#10;had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,&#10;took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole&#10;from my room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!&quot; I whispered, as I glided past her door.&#10;&quot;Farewell, my darling Adele!&quot; I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.&#10;No thought could be admitted of entering" />

The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-&#10;hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I&#10;recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door&#10;was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward&#10;attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but&#10;you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and&#10;amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once&#10;into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now&#10;and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling&#10;snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and&#10;dreamed.

I told you I would send Adele to school; and&#10;what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a&#10;French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why&#10;do you assign Adele to me for a companion?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:&#10;too dull for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Solitude! solitude!&quot; he reiterated with irritation.  &quot;I see I must come&#10;to an explanation.

No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from&#10;wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was&#10;a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but&#10;to go in and to say--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till&#10;death,&quot; and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of&#10;this.&#10;&#10;That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience&#10;for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He&#10;would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his&#10;love rejected" />
    <node id="1. Jane's sudden request for occupation to Mrs. Fairfax was prompted by her need to distract herself from her emotional turmoil and &quot;fine visions&quot; that she realized were unreal and could not be fulfilled at the moment. She sought to engage in a practical task to refocus her mind on something tangible and grounded in reality.&#10;2. Jane's smile revealed self-awareness of the contrast between her idealistic visions and external reality as it seemed shrewd, making light of her abstraction. The smile suggested that she was acknowledging the difference between her dreams and the actual challenges she faced in her life, demonstrating her maturity and growth throughout the novel." />
    <node id=" visions were not dark: there was a&#10;pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in&#10;your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:&#10;your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit&#10;follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.&#10;The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened&#10;you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was&#10;much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of&#10;your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very&#10;well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy&#10;sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly&#10;aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather&#10;black tempests to encounter.'

    <node id="1. The narrator, Mr. Rochester, has a complex relationship with his wife, Bertha Mason. He experiences &quot;hideous and degrading agonies&quot; due to her intemperate and unchaste behavior, but he chooses not to use cruelty to control her. This suggests that he is a compassionate person who avoids harsh methods, even in challenging circumstances. However, Mr. Rochester's marriage becomes unbearable as he cannot legally separate from Bertha due to her mental state, leaving him trapped in a miserable union.&#10;2. The &quot;arbitress of my life&quot; is a metaphor for the speaker's inner guide or conscience. It offered help during Mesrour's accident and left a sense of authority and regret upon its departure. This figure represents the speaker's moral compass, which has guided him throughout his life.&#10;3. Mr. Rochester desires Jane's spirit and personality rather than just her physical presence. He uses the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point, stating that he cannot tame or possess her spirit. Instead, he hopes that she chooses to stay with him of her own volition.&#10;4. After Jane's rejection of his proposal and the revelation of his marriage, Mr. Rochester walks down an unfamiliar road and avoids reflecting on the past or future. This suggests that he is attempting to escape from painful memories and associations tied to his past at Thornfield Hall, as well as avoiding thinking about his romantic prospects or any potential future relationships.&#10;5. Mr. Rochester's decision to ignore the beauty of the surrounding nature reflects his inner turmoil and emotional distress. He is preoccupied with his own thoughts and emotions, making it difficult for him to appreciate or notice the natural world around him. This indicates that he is struggling to come to terms with his situation and make sense of his feelings." />
    <node id="After the narrator, Jane Eyre, fell down while trying to reach the road, she managed to get up and crawl towards the hedge. She heard wheels and saw a coach coming on. Despite her initial fear that she might die, she stood up and lifted her hand, signaling for the coach to stop.&#10;&#10;The driver asked where she wanted to go, and although the original asking price was thirty shillings, Jane negotiated with him, offering twenty shillings instead. The driver agreed to take her there and even allowed her to ride inside the empty coach. This is how Jane secured a ride in a coach to a distant place for less than the original asking price." />
    <node id=" delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,&#10;extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some&#10;minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that&#10;here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and&#10;knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as&#10;ever to reach the road.&#10;&#10;When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and&#10;while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and&#10;lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named&#10;a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no&#10;connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty&#10;shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.&#10;He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was&#10;empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.&#10;&#10;Gentle reader" />
    <node id=" Mr. Rochester is trying to convince Jane to marry him, despite the fact that he is already legally married to Bertha Mason. He insists that the past is not important, and that the present and future are &quot;surer&quot; and &quot;brighter&quot; because he has found true love in Jane. He sees her as his &quot;sympathy,&quot; or emotional support, his &quot;better self,&quot; or moral guide, and his &quot;good angel.&quot; He believes that their love for each other is strong enough to overcome any obstacles, including his existing marriage. Rochester's insistence on focusing on the present and future may be a way for him to downplay the significance of his past mistakes and to convince Jane to disregard societal norms and laws in favor of following her heart." />
    <node id=" those days, sir,&quot; I interrupted, furtively&#10;dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for&#10;I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and&#10;these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Jane,&quot; he returned: &quot;what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,&#10;when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?&quot;&#10;&#10;I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.&#10;&#10;&quot;You see now how the case stands--do you not?&quot; he continued.  &quot;After a&#10;youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary&#10;solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have&#10;found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am&#10;bound to you with a strong attachment.

To&#10;tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I&#10;had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I&#10;feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early&#10;instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding&#10;confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness&#10;and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of&#10;agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier&#10;existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my&#10;resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and&#10;well loved in return.

I should not&#10;shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you&#10;should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you&#10;with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and&#10;never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of&#10;recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?

    <node id="1. The protagonist, Jane Eyre, is sneaking out of Thornfield Hall in the middle of the night because she has decided to leave her position as a governess at the estate. She has packed a parcel with some personal belongings, has twenty shillings for her journey, and carries her slippers to put on once she's safely away from the house. She does this quietly to avoid waking or drawing attention to herself while leaving." />
    <node id="1. The narrator, Mr. Rochester, decided to marry Bertha Mason (Miss Mason) hastily due to his father's pressure to marry into wealth. His father had intended for most of the family fortune to go to Mr. Rochester's older brother Rowland, leaving little for him. By marrying Bertha Mason, who had a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, Mr. Rochester aimed to ensure his financial comfort as per his father's wishes. Despite learning about the infamy of Bertha's mother and discovering her intemperate and unchaste behavior during their limited private conversations, Mr. Rochester went through with the marriage, ultimately leading to disastrous consequences." />
    <node id="1. The source of the narrator's (Mr. Rochester's) agony and restlessness is his complex relationship with his wife, Bertha Mason. He experiences &quot;hideous and degrading agonies&quot; due to her intemperate and unchaste behavior, but he chooses not to use cruelty to control her. Despite this, Mr. Rochester's marriage becomes unbearable as he cannot legally separate from Bertha due to her mental state, leaving him trapped in a miserable union. This leads to his emotional distress and restlessness.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester considers returning despite the consequences because of his strong feelings for Jane. He desires Jane's spirit and personality rather than just her physical presence, using the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point. He wants more from Jane than just her physical presence; he wants her love, loyalty, and companionship. This emotional connection and longing motivate him to consider returning despite the potential consequences." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester brought Jane to Thornfield Hall instead of Ferndean Manor because he feared that no governess would stay if they knew about the haunted inmate of the house. He had already decided to send Adele to school and needed a temporary solution for her care until then. Therefore, he chose to keep Jane at Thornfield Hall, despite knowing it was haunted, to ensure his plans could proceed smoothly without causing undue distress or inconvenience to Adele. Additionally, Ferndean Manor is described as more retired and hidden than Thornfield Hall, which might have made it a less appealing option for Jane, who values her independence and autonomy." />

Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,&#10;heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:&#10;but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired&#10;perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited&#10;me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them&#10;all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings">

Firstly, she must weigh her moral objections against complying with Mr. Rochester's request to live together without being married. Secondly, she is aware that he recognizes her reluctance and is not ready for accusations or revilement, which suggests a need for understanding and patience from both parties.&#10;&#10;Considering Mr. Rochester's character, the narrative portrays him as a compassionate person who avoids harsh methods even in difficult circumstances. His relationship with Bertha Mason was filled with &quot;hideous and degrading agonies,&quot; yet he chose not to use cruelty to control her behavior due to her insanity, which was discovered after four years of living together. This information may help Jane understand the complexity of Mr. Rochester's situation and empathize with his struggles.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester has expressed his desire for Jane's spirit and personality rather than just her physical presence, using the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point. He wants more from Jane than just her physical companionship; he wants her love, loyalty, and companionship. This could suggest that he respects Jane's autonomy and would not force her into a decision against her will.&#10;&#10;In the morning, Mr. Rochester is restlessly pacing in his room and awaiting Jane's presence. She must decide whether to confront him about their moral disagreement or to stay silent and leave for her new life as planned. Considering all these factors, it would be reasonable for Jane to have an open and honest conversation with Mr. Rochester about her concerns while also expressing her affection and appreciation for his kindness towards her. This way, she can maintain her moral integrity while also addressing the emotional turmoil that both of them are experiencing due to their impending separation.">

    <edge source="1. The narrator, Mr. Rochester, has a complex relationship with his wife, Bertha Mason. He experiences &quot;hideous and degrading agonies&quot; due to her intemperate and unchaste behavior, but he chooses not to use cruelty to control her. This suggests that he is a compassionate person who avoids harsh methods, even in challenging circumstances. However, Mr. Rochester's marriage becomes unbearable as he cannot legally separate from Bertha due to her mental state, leaving him trapped in a miserable union.&#10;2. The &quot;arbitress of my life&quot; is a metaphor for the speaker's inner guide or conscience. It offered help during Mesrour's accident and left a sense of authority and regret upon its departure. This figure represents the speaker's moral compass, which has guided him throughout his life.&#10;3. Mr. Rochester desires Jane's spirit and personality rather than just her physical presence. He uses the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point, stating that he cannot tame or possess her spirit. Instead, he hopes that she chooses to stay with him of her own volition.&#10;4. After Jane's rejection of his proposal and the revelation of his marriage, Mr. Rochester walks down an unfamiliar road and avoids reflecting on the past or future. This suggests that he is attempting to escape from painful memories and associations tied to his past at Thornfield Hall, as well as avoiding thinking about his romantic prospects or any potential future relationships.&#10;5. Mr. Rochester's decision to ignore the beauty of the surrounding nature reflects his inner turmoil and emotional distress. He is preoccupied with his own thoughts and emotions, making it difficult for him to appreciate or notice the natural world around him. This indicates that he is struggling to come to terms with his situation and make sense of his feelings." target="1.

Despite this, Mr. Rochester's marriage becomes unbearable as he cannot legally separate from Bertha due to her mental state, leaving him trapped in a miserable union. This leads to his emotional distress and restlessness.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester considers returning despite the consequences because of his strong feelings for Jane. He desires Jane's spirit and personality rather than just her physical presence, using the metaphor of a wild bird to illustrate this point. He wants more from Jane than just her physical presence; he wants her love, loyalty, and companionship. This emotional connection and longing motivate him to consider returning despite the potential consequences.">

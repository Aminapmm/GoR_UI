    <node id="Content: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: the global usage ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Global ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so if people don't have the technology .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think it has to be yellow .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound" />
    <node id="1. User Preferences: There is a discussion about offering multiple colors for the remote control to cater to the preferences of different users. Some users may prefer red or black remote controls, while others may not like the color yellow.&#10;&#10;2. Price: A concern is raised that having multiple color options might increase the production cost and, consequently, the price of the remote control. This could affect the product's marketability, especially if it becomes too expensive due to the various color choices.&#10;&#10;3. Simplicity and Ease of Use: The User Interface Designer mentions that having fewer buttons while maintaining functionality can lead to a more powerful and easy-to-use remote control. However, if multiple functions are assigned to one button, users might find it difficult to recognize and use them correctly.&#10;&#10;4. Branding and Recognition: Using the color of the product as an identifier can help customers quickly recognize the remote control in stores, making branding and marketing easier. The Project Manager emphasizes that the remote control should be fashionable and reflect their company's focus on integrating fashion into electronics.&#10;&#10;5. Meeting Participants: The Industrial Designer is assigned to work on the industrial design component, while the User Interface Designer is responsible for the user interface concept. Florent will work on the Project Manager's tasks, and a Marketing expert is also participating in the project." />
    <node id=" solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Specially distribution , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , it will cost little bit more .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , yeah , yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: some people prefer black remote control .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And also f&#10;" />
    <node id=" way of selling more . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Sure ? Yeah ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But I'm not sure {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know" />
    <node id=" mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: of the uh of real reaction&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and uh also {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So has to be yellow .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yellow .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Require lot of requirements ," />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, there are indeed concerns about increasing the price of the remote control by offering multiple color options. However, the focus of the discussion is mainly on the remote control for television, with fewer buttons for simplicity and ease of use. The project manager also wants to maintain branding and recognition through color and slogans.&#10;&#10;When it comes to the wireless remote control, there are concerns about losing it and the difficulty in establishing a link between the remote control and the television. An infrared-based remote control was proposed as a cheaper alternative with less technology compared to laser-based remotes. While there is no definitive answer regarding the feasibility of including a wireless remote control, the industrial designer does not think it would be too much more expensive.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while cost is a concern for implementing a wireless remote control, the team has not explicitly decided against it. It seems possible to include a wireless remote control in the product design, provided that it can be done without significantly increasing the price. Further discussion and exploration of cost-effective solutions may help the team make a final decision on this matter." />
    <node id=" we want to to do remote control&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that" />

    <node id="marker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It's is uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Lame , or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Yeah .&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Desired Functions: The remote control's primary function is for use with a television.

    <node id="1. Essential Buttons: The design should include essential buttons such as a power button, volume controls, channel navigation, mute button, input selection, number buttons, menu button, back/exit button, directional arrows, and select button (as listed in the Desired Functions section).&#10;&#10;2. Simplicity and Ease of Use: Having fewer buttons while maintaining functionality is crucial for a simple and easy-to-use remote control. Assigning multiple functions to one button might make it difficult for users to recognize and use them correctly, so it's best to stick to essential functions only.&#10;&#10;3. Clear Labeling: Clearly label each button with its corresponding function to ensure ease of use and quick recognition by the user.&#10;&#10;4. Infrared-based Technology: Based on the discussion, an infrared (IR) bulb will be used for the remote control's interaction with the television. This technology is common and cost-effective compared to laser-based remotes.&#10;&#10;5. Avoid Including Controls for Other Devices: Including controls for devices other than the TV can complicate the design and increase costs without providing significant benefits to the user experience for a TV remote control.&#10;&#10;6. Branding and Recognition: Using color as an identifier can help customers quickly recognize the remote control in stores, making branding and marketing easier. However, adding multiple color options might increase production costs and affect marketability due to a higher price point.&#10;&#10;7. Wireless Capability (if feasible at an affordable cost): While wireless capability might be attractive, it can add complexity and expense to the design without providing substantial benefits, especially considering that most TVs are placed within a reasonable distance from users. The team is open to discussing cost-effective solutions for including this feature.&#10;&#10;8. Directional Arrows and Select Button: Four-way directional arrows (up, down, left, right) enable easy navigation within menus and on-screen interfaces, while a select button in the center of the directional arrows allows users to confirm choices made with the arrow buttons." />
    <node id="The design of the television remote's buttons should focus on specific functionalities needed for television viewing by including essential buttons such as a power button, volume controls, channel navigation, mute button, input selection, number buttons, menu button, back/exit button, directional arrows, and select button. These buttons cater to the core functionalities of a TV remote control, allowing users to easily navigate through channels, adjust volume, access menus, and make selections.&#10;&#10;In contrast, incorporating features for other devices like recorders or garage doors can complicate the design and increase costs without providing significant benefits to the user experience for a TV remote control.

Volume Controls: Clearly labeled volume up and down buttons are necessary for easy audio adjustment.&#10;3. Channel Navigation: Channel up and down buttons should be included for navigating through channels.&#10;4. Mute Button: A separate mute button allows users to quickly mute the TV without having to lower the volume significantly.&#10;5. Input Selection: A button or buttons to switch between different input sources (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, etc.) is essential for connecting various devices to the TV.&#10;6. Number Buttons: Dedicated number buttons facilitate direct access to specific channels without having to scroll through them.&#10;7. Menu Button: A menu button grants users quick access to settings and other options on the TV.&#10;8. Back/Exit Button: A back or exit button can help users easily navigate back to previous screens or exit menus without having to go through multiple steps.&#10;9. Directional Arrows: Four-way directional arrows (up, down, left, right) enable easy navigation within menus and on-screen interfaces.&#10;10. Select Button: A select button in the center of the directional arrows allows users to confirm choices made with the arrow buttons.&#10;&#10;Features that should NOT be incorporated:&#10;&#10;1. Remote Controls for Other Devices: Including controls for devices other than the TV, such as recorders or camcorders, can complicate the design and increase costs without providing significant benefits to the user experience for a TV remote control.&#10;2. Unnecessary Buttons: Assigning multiple functions to one button might make it difficult for users to recognize and use them correctly. Stick to essential functions only.&#10;3. Wireless Capability (unless feasible at an affordable cost): While wireless capability might be an attractive feature, it can add complexity and expense to the design without providing substantial benefits, especially considering that most TVs are placed within a reasonable distance from users.">

Further discussion and exploration of cost-effective solutions may help the team make a final decision on this matter." target="The rationale behind the industrial designer's proposal for using an infrared (IR) base to relate the remote control device to the TV is based on its commonality, cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and ease of implementation. Infrared technology is a widely used solution for remote controls, offering several advantages over laser-based remotes. Some of these advantages include lower costs, easier implementation, and less complex design.&#10;&#10;Infrared-based remote controls are preferred in this case because they align with the project's goals of maintaining simplicity, ease of use, and reasonable costs. The IR bulb located within the remote control allows it to interact with the television, making it a straightforward technology that users are already familiar with. This familiarity can contribute to a better user experience and simplify the process of operating the television.&#10;&#10;In contrast, laser-based remotes, while potentially offering greater range or precision, tend to be more expensive and complex than IR-based systems. By utilizing IR technology, the team can ensure that they maintain focus on the project's core objectives, providing a user-friendly and cost-effective remote control solution for the television.">

Reflection of Society: The new remote control design aims to be a reflection of society by incorporating a simple and intuitive user interface, focusing on essential television functionalities. This focus aligns with the growing trend in technology towards minimalism and ease of use, making it more accessible for people of all ages and backgrounds.&#10;2. Attractiveness: The remote control's attractiveness is enhanced by maintaining branding and recognition through color and slogans. While there are concerns about increasing the price of the remote control by offering multiple color options, a single color option that represents Google's brand can still make the product visually appealing to users.&#10;3. Discontinuation of Teletext: With the discontinuation of teletext, the new remote control design will not include buttons specifically for teletext functionality. Instead, the focus is on incorporating essential television-specific functionalities such as power, volume controls, channel navigation, mute button, input selection, number buttons, menu button, back/exit button, directional arrows, and select button. This focused approach allows users to easily navigate through channels, adjust volume, access menus, and make selections without the confusion of unnecessary buttons related to discontinued services like teletext.&#10;&#10;In summary, the key elements and changes expected for the new remote control design include a reflection of society's trend towards minimalism and ease of use, an attractive design that maintains branding through color and slogans, and the discontinuation of teletext-specific buttons in favor of essential television functionalities.">

To address this, clear and consistent methods like long-press or double-tap can be used for accessing secondary functions.&#10;&#10;4. Branding and Recognition: Using color as an identifier can help customers quickly recognize the remote control in stores, making branding and marketing easier. The marketing team emphasizes that the remote control should be fashionable and reflect their company's focus on integrating fashion into electronics. This aligns with the goal of creating a visually appealing product that stands out from competitors.&#10;&#10;5. User Testing: Throughout the design process, engaging potential users for feedback on prototypes is crucial for identifying areas where simplicity and elegance could be improved further. Addressing any concerns raised during testing before finalizing the design can help ensure that the remote control meets user needs and appeals to their preferences.">

    <edge source="Based on the information provided in the transcript, it is possible to have a link between the remote control and the television, replacing traditional wire connections. The proposed technology for the remote control is infrared (IR)-based, which is a common and cost-effective solution compared to laser-based remotes. IR technology can establish a link with the television without needing wires.&#10;&#10;However, there are concerns about the feasibility of including a wireless remote control without significantly increasing the price. While there is no definitive answer regarding its feasibility, the industrial designer suggested that it might not be too much more expensive to include wireless capabilities in the design. &#10;&#10;Therefore, having a link between the remote control and the television could be both feasible and cost-effective, depending on the specific implementation details and potential solutions for addressing concerns about losing the remote or establishing a link between the devices. Further discussion and exploration of these factors may help the team make an informed decision regarding the inclusion of wireless capabilities in the TV controller design." target="Based on the information provided in the transcripts, there is no mention of designing a wireless speaker with a remote control. The discussion focuses solely on the design of a remote control for a Google TV. Therefore, the question about having a cable between the remote control and the TV is not directly applicable to the discussed topic.&#10;&#10;However, to answer the question in general terms: In the context of designing a wireless speaker with a remote control, having a cable between the two would defeat the purpose of having a wireless speaker, as one of the main benefits of wireless speakers is their ability to be placed anywhere without the need for wired connections. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a wireless speaker would require a wireless remote control to maintain its functionality and convenience.">

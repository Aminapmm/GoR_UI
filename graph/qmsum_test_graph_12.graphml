    <node id="1. The plastic cases of the 'double curve' won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source because they cannot incorporate the necessary solar panels to convert light energy into electricity. This is mentioned in the transcript when the Industrial Designer states, &quot;...and these latex cases, there's no problem using solar cells as an energy source, but the plastic ones won't allow it.&quot;&#10;2. Hand dyn dynamos provide an alternative power solution for remote controls by offering a manual way of generating electricity. This is discussed when the Project Manager brings up different energy sources and mentions hand dyn dynamos being used for powering remote controls. Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that these dynamos work by converting mechanical energy from winding into electrical energy to power the device." />

    <node id="ound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {" />

    <node id="The project manager and industrial designer have decided on a single-curved case for the product. They initially considered traditional batteries and solar as options for the energy source, but due to market preferences, they settled for a more reliable and cheaper battery with solar cell solution. &#10;&#10;Regarding the kinetic energy option, both individuals discuss its possibility, with the project manager expressing concerns that it might be too flashy. The industrial designer agrees, suggesting instead that they combine the kinetic energy option with batteries. This would allow them to save on battery usage when there's enough kinetic energy available. They also mention the voice recognition feature as a significant power consumer in their design.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the team is open to exploring advanced energy options like kinetic energy, they are cautious about making the product too flashy and are focusing on user-friendly, reliable, and cost-effective solutions for the target market." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Good .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Kineti okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: too {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content:" />

    <node id="1. The different types of finishing for the advanced three-dimensionally curved shaped casings include plastic, rubber, wood, and titanium. However, it is specified that titanium cannot be used on double curve cases, which is why they are not mentioned as an option for the single-curved case. The reason why plastic latex cases do not allow the use of solar cells as an energy source is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it can be inferred that there may be some restrictions related to incorporating solar panels into these specific plastic cases.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding the double curve cases, only plastic and latex options are mentioned, with a note about solar cell compatibility. The transcript states: &quot;and these latex cases, there's no problem using solar cells as an energy source, but the plastic ones won't allow it.&quot; This means that the plastic double curve cases cannot incorporate solar panels to convert light energy into electricity due to design limitations.&#10;&#10;3. For the advanced three-dimensionally curved shaped casings, four materials are discussed: plastic, rubber, wood, and titanium. However, there is no mention of solar cells or any restrictions regarding their use with these materials. It seems that this part of the discussion focuses on the aesthetic and tactile qualities of each material rather than energy source compatibility." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is no indication of any significant changes required for the project at this stage. The marketing team mentioned that they might need to check if there were any last-minute changes, but it seems nothing major has come up.&#10;&#10;The project manager does not have new information to discuss with the team regarding project changes, as they mention having only the same information as before. However, they are expecting updated notes and decisions from the industrial design team (Tentel and Sebastian) to be placed in a shared folder for easy access and reference by all team members.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are no major changes needed for the project currently, and the project manager does not have new information to discuss with the team, including Tentel and Sebastian from industrial design." />

    <node id="1. The plastic cases of the 'double curve' design won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source because they cannot incorporate the necessary solar panels to convert light energy into electricity. This is mentioned in the transcript when the Industrial Designer states, &quot;...and these latex cases, there's no problem using solar cells as an energy source, but the plastic ones won't allow it.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. As for alternative power options for remote controls, hand dyn dynamos are being considered. These devices convert mechanical energy from winding into electrical energy to power the device, offering a manual way of generating electricity. This was discussed when the Project Manager brought up different energy sources and mentioned hand dyn dynamos being used for powering remote controls." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, it seems that there was discussion about using rubber material for this project, with different preferences from older and younger people. Older people prefer rubber materials that resemble wood, while younger people like soft and spongy materials.

    <node id="1. The different types of finishes for the advanced three-dimensionally curved shaped casings include plastic, rubber, wood, and titanium. However, it is specified that titanium cannot be used on double curve cases due to design or manufacturing limitations.&#10;2. Plastic latex cases, specifically those with a double curve design, do not allow the use of solar cells as an energy source because they cannot incorporate the necessary solar panels to convert light energy into electricity. The transcript states that &quot;...and these latex cases, there's no problem using solar cells as an energy source, but the plastic ones won't allow it.&quot; This implies that plastic double curve cases have design limitations preventing the integration of solar panels." />
    <node id="There is a debate about whether the front of the device, where the buttons are located, should be made of rubber because of concerns regarding the feasibility of incorporating scroll-wheels into the design due to the curved shape of the rubber case. The team initially considered using scroll-wheels, which would typically require a flat surface. However, as they moved forward with the idea of using spongy rubber material preferred by their customers, they realized that push buttons might be more suitable for a curved rubber surface. This shift in the design approach led to discussions about whether it is necessary for the button area to be made of rubber or if plastic buttons in a rubber case would also work. The debate ultimately revolves around finding the best balance between customer preferences, functionality, and manufacturing constraints." />

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the industrial designer considers using a voice function with infrared technology to be dull and illogical because it would require pointing another device at the product being used. This is seen as an inconvenient and outdated approach, as modern voice recognition technologies do not require such direct line-of-sight or manual interaction. The designer implies that this could negatively impact user experience and preference.&#10;&#10;In terms of infrared technology specifically for the voice function, it is not explicitly mentioned why it might be problematic to incorporate. However, considering their overall focus on user-friendly, reliable, and cost-effective solutions, the team may have concerns about the reliability, complexity, or additional cost associated with implementing infrared-based voice recognition." />
    <node id="1. Shape: The shape of the remote control may need to accommodate push buttons instead of scroll-wheels due to the curved shape of the rubber case. This shift in the design approach is aimed at finding the best balance between customer preferences, functionality, and manufacturing constraints.&#10;2. Color: The team seems to prefer using colorful rubber material for the remote control. Additionally, they want to incorporate company colors such as black, yellow, or grey into the design.&#10;3. Texture: Spongy and scratch-resistant properties are desired for the rubber material of the remote control. This preference caters to both older people who prefer materials that resemble wood and younger people who like soft and spongy materials.&#10;4. Scroll-wheels: Although there were concerns about feasibility, scroll-wheels implementable with a regular chip are still considered useful for the design. However, the team needs to be prepared to accommodate push buttons if necessary due to the curved shape of the rubber case." />
    <node id="1. Grip placement in the remote control: The team is discussing how the grip position on the remote control can influence button arrangement. They want all buttons to be within reach of the user's thumb when holding the remote control naturally.&#10;2. Volume button placement: The industrial designer suggests that placing the volume button on the side of the remote control would be ideal for easy access and better gripping.&#10;&#10;In this transcript, the project manager and team members are discussing ways to improve the grip on certain remote controls by strategically placing buttons and considering ergonomic designs such as a side-mounted volume button. This helps ensure user comfort and ease of use while operating the device." />

    <node id="1. Energy: The team has decided to use a battery with solar cell solution as the primary energy source. They have also discussed the possibility of incorporating a kinetic energy option to save on battery usage when there's enough kinetic energy available, but are cautious about making the product too flashy.&#10;2. Chip: The team has chosen to use the regular chip, which does not support LCD display. They decided not to use LCD to keep the cost down and because they believed it was unnecessary for their product's user interface.&#10;3. Case design: The project manager and industrial designer have settled on a single-curved case design made of colorful and spongy rubber material with scratch-resistant properties. They will explore using push buttons instead of scroll-wheels due to the curved shape of the rubber case. The plastic cases of the 'double curve' design won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source.&#10;4. User Interface: The user interface designer mentioned the cost of displaying a digit on screen and stated that any TV can view a digit on screen, implying that an additional display is unnecessary. The project manager summarized this consensus by saying &quot;on-screen display . Yeah.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. The issue with using kinetic energy from body movement to power a remote control for watching movies, as suggested by the analogy of a self-charging watch, is that it may not provide consistent and reliable charging during extended periods of inactivity. When watching a movie, users might hold the remote control without moving for long stretches of time. If there's not enough kinetic energy generated through small body movements or shaking, the remote control could run out of power at inconvenient times, such as when they want to switch channels.&#10;2. The team acknowledges that combining kinetic energy with traditional batteries might be a potential solution. This way, the device can rely on battery power when there's insufficient kinetic energy generated due to inactivity. They also mention that voice recognition features consume significant amounts of power, so this should be taken into account during the design process." />

    <node id="1. Proposed changes to the material and design of the device cover: The team is discussing the possibility of using a combination of rubber and plastic for the device cover. This idea was brought up when the project manager asked if it's possible to make the cover out of rubber with plastic finishing or vice versa, considering their manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing. They are considering having a plastic cover with rubber finishing, specifically a rubber edge or &quot;what's on the edge, what you feel&quot; as described by the project manager. The industrial designer agrees with this suggestion.&#10;2. Project manager suggesting a plastic cover with rubber finishing: The project manager is proposing this change primarily for better grip and user comfort. Having a rubber edge provides a more comfortable hold and enhances the overall user experience. Additionally, the front part of the device, where the buttons are located, does not necessarily have to be made of rubber. By having a plastic cover with a rubber finishing, they can maintain a sleek design for the button area while still providing a better grip through the rubber-coated edges." />
    <node id="Placing the volume button on the side of the remote control would be ideal for easy access and better gripping because, with the suggested grip placement, users will naturally hold the remote control with their thumb positioned to easily reach and operate a side-mounted volume button. This ergonomic design allows for more comfortable use and faster access to commonly used functions like volume control without having to adjust the grip or reposition the fingers." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, it is requested that all team members place their notes from meetings in a shared folder, regardless of whether they usually create formal minutes or not. This ensures that all relevant information and decisions made during meetings are easily accessible and available to all team members, promoting transparency, effective communication, and better collaboration. In this case, the project manager wants to review the notes taken by others, such as the industrial designer (Tentel and Sebastian), to stay informed about discussed issues, action items, and decisions made during meetings." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the marketing speaker suggested using soft and colorful materials for the product to cater to the preferences of the younger group. However, they also noted that the older group likes more familiar materials, such as those that resemble wood. To address both groups' needs, the team discussed using rubber material that has a spongy texture and can be made colorful, making it visually appealing for the younger group while potentially having a similar feel to wood for the older group.&#10;&#10;Regarding design choices, the marketing speaker mentioned incorporating simple shapes and dark colors for the older group's preference, but since they are primarily focusing on the younger group, they want to explore push buttons as an alternative to scroll-wheels or other components that require flat surfaces due to the curved shape of the rubber case.&#10;&#10;In summary, when catering to both older and younger groups for a product, the team discussed using colorful and spongy rubber material with scratch-resistant properties and simple shapes with dark colors. They also discussed providing push buttons instead of scroll-wheels due to the curved shape of the rubber case." />

Although scroll-wheels are still considered useful for the design, the team needs to be prepared to accommodate push buttons if required by the curved shape of the rubber case.&#10;&#10;In summary, the design discussions focus on integrating scroll-wheels or push buttons into a spongy and colorful rubber casing that caters to various customer preferences while ensuring functionality and manufacturability." />
    <node id="1. Side-mounted volume button: The industrial designer suggests placing the volume buttons on the side of the remote control, making them easily accessible and improving the overall grip. This ergonomic design allows users to reach the volume buttons naturally with their thumb while maintaining a comfortable hold on the device.&#10;2. Curved shape for push buttons: Due to the curved design of the rubber case, the industrial designer recommends accommodating push buttons instead of scroll-wheels. This adjustment ensures better compatibility between the remote's form and functionality, providing a more user-friendly experience.&#10;3. Scratch-resistant and spongy texture: The industrial designer prefers using a spongy rubber material that is scratch-resistant for the remote control. This preference caters to both older users who appreciate materials that resemble wood and younger users who like soft, spongy materials.&#10;4. Alternative power options: Although not explicitly mentioned, the industrial designer may consider alternative power sources such as hand dyn dynamos, which convert mechanical energy from winding into electrical energy, as discussed by the project manager. This option would provide a manual way of generating electricity for the remote control." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the important themes discussed regarding material and color preferences for a product include:&#10;&#10;1. Color Preferences: The team discussed using rubber material that can be made colorful to cater to both older and younger groups' needs. While the older group prefers dark colors, the marketing speaker mentioned that the younger group would appreciate colorful materials for the product.&#10;2. Texture: The rubber material should have spongy and scratch-resistant properties, appealing to both older people who prefer materials that resemble wood and younger people who like soft and spongy materials.&#10;3. Scroll-wheels vs. Push Buttons: Although scroll-wheels implementable with a regular chip are still considered useful for the design, the team needs to be prepared to accommodate push buttons if necessary due to the curved shape of the rubber case.&#10;&#10;There was no mention in the transcript of incorporating fruits and vegetables into the product's design." />
    <node id="1. Shape: The transcript does not mention any discussion about incorporating a shape that resembles a banana or other fruits and vegetables into the product's design. The focus is on finding a solution for implementing push buttons on a curved rubber case instead.&#10;2. Color: While colorful materials were discussed, there is no indication that the team specifically wanted to create a design reminiscent of a banana telephone. The idea of using company colors such as black, yellow, or grey was mentioned, but not in relation to any particular shape or design inspiration.&#10;3. Texture: The texture preferences for rubber material (spongy and scratch-resistant) are unrelated to the discussion about creating a product that resembles a banana telephone.&#10;&#10;In summary, there is no mention of a specific idea regarding colorful and traditionally-covered telephones with a simple design that resembles a banana in the given transcript. The team discussed various aspects related to material preferences, texture, and shape, but not specifically a banana-inspired telephone design." />

    <node id="1. Volume buttons: These buttons allow users to adjust the volume of their device. The industrial designer suggests placing these buttons on the side of the remote control for easy access and better gripping, as it would be within reach of the user's thumb when holding the remote control naturally.&#10;2. Push buttons: These are physical buttons that users can press to interact with the remote control. The designers recommend accommodating push buttons instead of scroll-wheels due to the curved design of the rubber case, ensuring better compatibility between the remote's form and functionality.&#10;3. Scroll-wheels (alternative): Although there were concerns about feasibility, scroll-wheels implementable with a regular chip are still being considered for the design. They would allow users to scroll or navigate through options smoothly. However, the team needs to be prepared to accommodate push buttons if necessary due to the curved shape of the rubber case.&#10;4. Solar cells (not feasible in this case): The designers initially consider using solar cells as an energy source for the remote control by incorporating solar panels into the design. However, they later realize that it won't be possible for plastic cases, which cannot use solar cells as an energy source due to their inability to incorporate the necessary solar panels.&#10;5. Hand dyn dynamos (alternative power option): This type of device converts mechanical energy from winding into electrical energy, offering a manual way of generating electricity for the remote control. The project manager discusses this possibility as one of the alternative power sources for remote controls." />
    <node id="The discussion about the color and design of remote controls revolves around targeting preferences for both older and younger users. The marketing team suggests that a younger demographic would prefer more colorful objects, while another participant (possibly the user interface designer) mentions that some users might like darker colors. In response to this, the industrial designer clarifies that they are not looking for something dull.&#10;&#10;The user interface then proposes using corporate colors such as grey and yellow, but there seems to be some disagreement with this suggestion. The marketing team also brings up an example of clothing and shoes having colorful designs, which further emphasizes their point about targeting a younger audience with vibrant colors.&#10;&#10;In summary, the discussion focuses on finding a balance between using colorful or darker tones for the remote control design while considering the preferences of both older and younger user demographics." />

The issue with using kinetic energy from body movement to power a remote control for watching movies, as suggested by the analogy of a self-charging watch, is that it may not provide consistent and reliable charging during extended periods of inactivity. When watching a movie, users might hold the remote control without moving for long stretches of time.

The issue with using kinetic energy from body movement to power a remote control for watching movies, as suggested by the analogy of a self-charging watch, is that it may not provide consistent and reliable charging during extended periods of inactivity. When watching a movie, users might hold the remote control without moving for long stretches of time. If there's not enough kinetic energy generated through small body movements or shaking, the remote control could run out of power at inconvenient times, such as when they want to switch channels.&#10;2. The team acknowledges that combining kinetic energy with traditional batteries might be a potential solution. This way, the device can rely on battery power when there's insufficient kinetic energy generated due to inactivity.

The idea of using colorful rubber material came up, which could potentially appeal to both groups.&#10;&#10;As for the scroll-wheels, it was mentioned that they can be handy and implemented with a regular chip. However, there were concerns about the feasibility of incorporating them into the design due to the curved shape of the rubber case. Later in the conversation, it seemed that the team decided to explore using push buttons instead of scroll-wheels or other components that require flat surfaces.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the discussion, a possible answer to the question would be:&#10;&#10;Colorful and spongy rubber material with scratch-resistant properties and scroll-wheels implementable with a regular chip is preferred for this project, keeping in mind that the design may need to accommodate push buttons instead of scroll-wheels due to the curved shape of the rubber case. The rubber material should also have company colors such as black, yellow, or grey.">

This idea was brought up when the project manager asked if it's possible to make the cover out of rubber with plastic finishing or vice versa, considering their manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing. They are considering having a plastic cover with rubber finishing, specifically a rubber edge or &quot;what's on the edge, what you feel&quot; as described by the project manager. The industrial designer agrees with this suggestion.&#10;2. Project manager suggesting a plastic cover with rubber finishing: The project manager is proposing this change primarily for better grip and user comfort. Having a rubber edge provides a more comfortable hold and enhances the overall user experience. Additionally, the front part of the device, where the buttons are located, does not necessarily have to be made of rubber. By having a plastic cover with a rubber finishing, they can maintain a sleek design for the button area while still providing a better grip through the rubber-coated edges.">

The designers recommend accommodating push buttons instead of scroll-wheels due to the curved design of the rubber case, ensuring better compatibility between the remote's form and functionality.&#10;3. Scroll-wheels (alternative): Although there were concerns about feasibility, scroll-wheels implementable with a regular chip are still being considered for the design. They would allow users to scroll or navigate through options smoothly. However, the team needs to be prepared to accommodate push buttons if necessary due to the curved shape of the rubber case.&#10;4. Solar cells (not feasible in this case): The designers initially consider using solar cells as an energy source for the remote control by incorporating solar panels into the design. However, they later realize that it won't be possible for plastic cases, which cannot use solar cells as an energy source due to their inability to incorporate the necessary solar panels.&#10;5. Hand dyn dynamos (alternative power option): This type of device converts mechanical energy from winding into electrical energy, offering a manual way of generating electricity for the remote control. The project manager discusses this possibility as one of the alternative power sources for remote controls.">

    <edge source="Based on the meeting transcript, the important themes discussed regarding material and color preferences for a product include:&#10;&#10;1. Color Preferences: The team discussed using rubber material that can be made colorful to cater to both older and younger groups' needs. While the older group prefers dark colors, the marketing speaker mentioned that the younger group would appreciate colorful materials for the product.&#10;2. Texture: The rubber material should have spongy and scratch-resistant properties, appealing to both older people who prefer materials that resemble wood and younger people who like soft and spongy materials.&#10;3. Scroll-wheels vs. Push Buttons: Although scroll-wheels implementable with a regular chip are still considered useful for the design, the team needs to be prepared to accommodate push buttons if necessary due to the curved shape of the rubber case.&#10;&#10;There was no mention in the transcript of incorporating fruits and vegetables into the product's design." target="1. Shape: The transcript does not mention any discussion about incorporating a shape that resembles a banana or other fruits and vegetables into the product's design. The focus is on finding a solution for implementing push buttons on a curved rubber case instead.&#10;2. Color: While colorful materials were discussed, there is no indication that the team specifically wanted to create a design reminiscent of a banana telephone. The idea of using company colors such as black, yellow, or grey was mentioned, but not in relation to any particular shape or design inspiration.&#10;3. Texture: The texture preferences for rubber material (spongy and scratch-resistant) are unrelated to the discussion about creating a product that resembles a banana telephone.&#10;&#10;In summary, there is no mention of a specific idea regarding colorful and traditionally-covered telephones with a simple design that resembles a banana in the given transcript. The team discussed various aspects related to material preferences, texture, and shape, but not specifically a banana-inspired telephone design.">

The plastic cases of the 'double curve' design won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source because they cannot incorporate the necessary solar panels to convert light energy into electricity. This is mentioned in the transcript when the Industrial Designer states, &quot;...and these latex cases, there's no problem using solar cells as an energy source, but the plastic ones won't allow it.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. Hand dyn dynamos provide a viable alternative power solution for remote controls by offering a manual way of generating electricity. These devices convert mechanical energy from winding into electrical energy to power the device. This was discussed when the Project Manager brought up different energy sources and mentioned hand dyn dynamos being used for powering remote controls, although not explicitly stated in the transcript.">

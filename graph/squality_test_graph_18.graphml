    <node id="The likelihood of the protagonist, Jon Karyl, surviving and fulfilling his goal of warning the SP ship is quite low. The Steel-Blues have already shown their ability to delve deeper than the surface of Jon's mind, which means they can probably anticipate his plans. They also mentioned that they have equipped their ship with a force field specifically designed to deflect Jon's atomic guns, indicating that they are prepared for any attempts he might make using his pistol. Additionally, Jon's thoughts need to be directed outward in order for the Steel-Blues to read them, but this does not mean they cannot still gain information from his mind.

He was still curious.&#10; &#10; And he was interested in staying alive as&#10; long as possible. There was a remote chance&#10; he might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously,&#10; he glanced toward his belt to see the little&#10; power pack which, if under ideal conditions,&#10; could finger out fifty thousand miles into&#10; space.&#10; &#10; If he could somehow stay alive the 21&#10; days he might be able to warn the patrol.&#10; He couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for&#10; his life would be snuffed out immediately.&#10; &#10; The Steel-Blue said quietly:&#10; &#10; &quot;It might be ironical to let you warn&#10; that SP ship you keep thinking about. But&#10; we know your weapon now. Already our&#10; ship is equipped with a force field designed&#10; especially to deflect your atomic guns.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts&#10; quickly. They can delve deeper than the&#10; surface of the mind.

Back to the torture room.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Like R-dust,&quot; Jon growled. He pressed&#10; the firing stud on the stubray gun. One of&#10; Steel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to&#10; the rocky sward.&#10; &#10; Steel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used&#10; once before. A tentacle danced over it.&#10; &#10; Abruptly Jon found himself standing on&#10; a pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue had cut a&#10; swath around him 15 feet deep and five feet&#10; wide.&#10; &#10; &quot;Back to the room,&quot; Steel-Blue commanded.&#10; &#10; Jon resheathed the stubray pistol,&#10; shrugged non-committally and leaped the&#10; trench.

    <node id=" years scientists had&#10; been preaching preparedness as Earth flung&#10; her ships into the reaches of the solar system,&#10; taking the first long step toward the&#10; conquest of space.&#10; &#10; There are other races somewhere, they&#10; argued. As strong and smart as man, many&#10; of them so transcending man in mental and&#10; inventive power that we must be prepared to&#10; strike the minute danger shows.&#10; &#10; Now here was the answer to the scientists'&#10; warning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.&#10; &#10; &quot;What did you say?&quot; asked Steel-Blue.&#10;&quot;I couldn't understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just thinking to myself,&quot; Jon answered.&#10; It was a welcome surprise. Apparently his&#10; thoughts had to be directed outward, rather&#10; than inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to&#10; read it.&#10; &#10; He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping&#10; lock of the invaders' space ship wondering&#10; how he could warn Earth. The Space&#10; Patrol cruiser was due in for refueling at&#10; his service station in 21 days. But by that&#10; time he probably would be mouldering in&#10; the rocky dust of the asteroid.&#10; &#10; It was pitch dark within the ship but the&#10; Steel" />

Bring him&#10; back when the torture is done.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What&#10; kind of torture could this be?&#10; &#10; Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the&#10; chronometer on his wrist.&#10; &#10; Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien&#10; ship and halted expectantly just outside the&#10; ship's lock.&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the&#10; stubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my&#10; way out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he&#10; toted up the disadvantages.&#10; &#10; He either would have to find a hiding&#10; place on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues&#10; wanted him bad enough they could tear the&#10; whole place to pieces, or somehow get&#10; aboard the little life ship hidden in the&#10; service station.&#10; &#10; In that he would be just a sitting duck.&#10; &#10; He shrugged off the slight temptation to&#10; use the pistol.

They apparently&#10; were near topside of the vessel.&#10; &#10; A Steel-Blue, more massive than his&#10; guide and with four more pair of tentacles,&#10; including two short ones that grew from the&#10; top of its head, spoke out.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is the violator?&quot; Jon's Steel-Blue&#10; nodded.&#10; &#10; &quot;You know the penalty?

    <node id=". The liquid had taken the edge&#10; off his thirst.&#10; &#10; It was on the fifth day of his torture that&#10; Jon Karyl decided that he was going to get&#10; something to eat or perish in the attempt.&#10; &#10; The cylinder sat passively in its niche in&#10; the circle. A dozen Steel-Blues were watching&#10; as Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed&#10; his stubray.&#10; &#10; They merely watched as he pressed the&#10; stubray's firing stud. Invisible rays licked&#10; out of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol.&#10; The plastic splintered.&#10; &#10; Jon was out of his goldfish bowl and&#10; striding toward his own igloo adjacent to&#10; the service station when a Steel-Blue&#10; accosted him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Out of my way,&quot; grunted Jon, waving&#10; the stubray. &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,&quot; said&#10; the creature who barred his way. &quot;Go back&#10; to your torture.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of&#10; your tentacles and eat it without seasoning.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Eat?&quot; The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled.&#10; &#10;" />

He'd taken on&#10; the lonely, nerve-wracking job of service&#10; station attendant just to see what it offered.&#10; &#10; Here was a part of it, and it was certainly&#10; something new.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is the examination room,&quot; his&#10; Steel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.&#10; &#10; A green effulgence surrounded him.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; There&#10; was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the&#10; tiny microphone on the outside of his&#10; suit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go&#10; through his body. Then it seemed as if a&#10; half dozen hands were inside him, examining&#10; his internal organs. His stomach contracted.&#10; He felt a squeeze on his heart. His&#10; lungs tickled.&#10; &#10; There were several more queer motions&#10; inside his body.&#10; &#10; Then another Steel-Blue voice said:&#10; &#10; &quot;He is a soft-metal creature, made up of&#10; metals that melt at a very low temperature.&#10; He also contains a liquid whose makeup I&#10; cannot ascertain by ray-probe" />

How do&#10; you feel?&quot;&#10; &#10; Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness&#10; of hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he&#10; answered honestly enough: &quot;My guts feel as&#10; if they're chewing each other up. My bones&#10; ache. My joints creak. I can't coordinate I'm&#10; so hungry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That is the hemlock,&quot; Steel-Blue said.&#10; &#10; It was when he quaffed the new and&#10; stronger draught that Jon knew that his&#10; hope that it was citric acid was squelched.&#10; &#10; The acid taste was weaker which meant&#10; that the citric acid was the diluting liquid.&#10; It was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath&#10; the tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive&#10; acid.&#10; &#10; On the" />

An&#10; opening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a&#10; spacescope, was appearing in the center of&#10; the cylinder.&#10; &#10; A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the&#10; opening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder&#10; that had sprouted tentacles. It contained a&#10; yellowish liquid.&#10; &#10; One of the tentacles reached into the&#10; opening and clasped the glass. The opening&#10; closed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor&#10; appendages, moved toward Jon.&#10; &#10; He didn't like the looks of" />

Finally the red one.&#10; &#10; The thin fin—the cannon's sight—split in&#10; half as the turret opened and the coiled nose&#10; of the cannon protruded. There was a&#10; soundless flash. Then a sharp crack.&#10; &#10; Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the&#10; bolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship&#10; of the solar system. There was nothing that&#10; could withstand even the slight jolt of power&#10; given by the station cannon on any of the&#10; Sun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of&#10; the ship had changed. A bubble of metal,&#10; like a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off&#10; the vessel and struck the rocket of the&#10; asteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.&#10; &#10; He pressed the red button again.&#10; &#10; Then abruptly he was on the floor of the&#10; power room, his legs strangely cut out from&#10; under him" />
    <node id="The &quot;torture&quot; that Jon Karyl is about to experience is not actually a form of torture but a method of execution. The Steel-Blues have told him that they will use a liquid they normally use to dissolve metals, which causes joints to harden and eventually disintegrates into dust. They have built a miniature reproduction of Jon's service station inside an igloo and plan to execute him by exposing him to this liquid in the same atmosphere he is used to. The purpose of this method is to kill him while he undergoes the conditions of his normal life, as they believe that he is a violator who deserves to be punished according to their laws." />
    <node id=" is this torture?&quot; Jon Karyl asked.&#10; &#10; The answer was almost caressing: &quot;It is&#10; a liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes&#10; joints to harden if even so much as a drop&#10; remains on it long. It eats away the metal,&#10; leaving a scaly residue which crumbles&#10; eventually into dust.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will dilute it with a harmless liquid&#10; for you since No. 1 does not wish you to die&#10; instantly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Enter your&quot;—the Steel-Blue hesitated—&quot;mausoleum.&#10; You die in your own atmosphere.&#10; However, we took the liberty of purifying&#10; it. There were dangerous elements in&#10; it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon walked into the little igloo. The&#10; Steel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials&#10; and switches on the outside. Jon's space suit&#10; deflated. Pressure was building up in the&#10; igloo.&#10; &#10; He took a sample of the air, found that&#10; it was good, although quite rich in oxygen&#10; compared with what he'd been using in the&#10; service station and in his suit.&#10; &#10; With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet&#10; and gulped huge" />
    <node id="&#10; leash on my thoughts?&#10; &#10; The Steel-Blue chuckled. &quot;You get—absent-minded,&#10; is it?—every once in a&#10; while.&quot;&#10; &#10; Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared&#10; lugging great sheets of plastic and various&#10; other equipment.&#10; &#10; They dumped their loads and began unbundling&#10; them.&#10; &#10; Working swiftly, they built a plastic&#10; igloo, smaller than the living room in the&#10; larger service station igloo. They ranged instruments&#10; inside—one of them Jon Karyl&#10; recognized as an air pump from within the&#10; station—and they laid out a pallet.&#10; &#10; When they were done Jon saw a miniature&#10; reproduction of the service station, lacking&#10; only the cannon cap and fin, and with clear&#10; plastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the&#10; other.&#10; &#10; His Steel-Blue said: &quot;We have reproduced&#10; the atmosphere of your station so that you&#10; be watched while you undergo the torture&#10; under the normal conditions of your life.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What is this torture?&quot; Jon Karyl asked.&#10; &#10; The answer was almost caressing: &quot;It is&#10; a liquid we use to dissolve metals. It" />
    <node id=" One said,&#10; &#10; &quot;You are alive.&quot; The thought registered&#10; amazement. &quot;When you lost consciousness,&#10; we thought you had&quot;—there was a hesitation—&quot;as&#10; you say, died.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Jon Karyl said. &quot;I didn't die. I&#10; was just plain dead-beat so I went to sleep.&quot;&#10; The Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good it is that you live. The torture&#10; will continue,&quot; spoke No. 1 before loping&#10; away.&#10; &#10; The cylinder business began again. This&#10; time, Jon drank the bitter liquid slowly, trying&#10; to figure out what it was. It had a&#10; familiar, tantalizing taste but he couldn't&#10; quite put a taste-finger on it.&#10; &#10; His belly said he was hungry. He glanced&#10; at his chronometer. Only 20 days left before&#10; the SP ship arrived.&#10; &#10; Would this torture—he chuckled—last&#10; until then? But he was growing more and&#10; more conscious that his belly was screaming&#10; for hunger. The liquid had taken the edge&#10; off his thirst.&#10; &#10; It was on the fifth day of his torture that&#10; Jon Karyl decided that he" />
    <node id="The purpose of filling Jon Karyl's &quot;mausoleum&quot; with the liquid is to execute him using a method that simulates the conditions of his normal life. The Steel-Blues use this corrosive substance, which they typically utilize to dissolve metals, as a form of punishment for those who violate their laws. When exposed to this liquid, metal joints harden and eventually disintegrate into dust.&#10;&#10; This liquid is diluted with a harmless liquid before being introduced into Jon's mausoleum since the Steel-Blues do not want him to die instantly. The mausoleum is filled with an atmosphere similar to what Jon experiences in his service station, but with purified air. The space suit deflates as pressure builds up inside the igloo, and Jon takes off his helmet after confirming that the air quality is good.&#10;&#10; The liquid's composition remains undisclosed in the text, but it is mentioned to cause joints to harden and dissolve metals. Additionally, the Steel-Blues fear this substance as it would rust their joints, short their wiring, and kill them if they come into contact with it." />
    <node id="&#10; they feared that liquid. It would rust their&#10; joints, short their wiring, and kill them.&#10; No wonder they stared when I kept alive&#10; after drinking enough to completely annihilate&#10; a half-dozen of them.&#10; &#10; &quot;But what happened when you met the&#10; ship?&quot;&#10; &#10; The space captain grinned.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not much. Our crew was busy creating&#10; a hollow shell filled with water to be shot&#10; out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile&#10; thrower.&#10; &#10; &quot;These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put&#10; traction beams on us and started tugging us&#10; toward the asteroid. We tried a couple of&#10; atomic shots but when they just glanced off,&#10; we gave up.&#10; &#10; &quot;They weren't expecting the shell of&#10; water. When it hit that blue ship, you could&#10; almost see it oxidize before your eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;I guess they knew what was wrong right&#10; away. They let go the traction beams and&#10; tried to get away. They forgot about the&#10; force field, so we just poured atomic fire&#10; into the weakening ship. It just melted&#10; away.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl got up from the divan where&#10;" />

He walked slowly back and reentered&#10; the torture chamber.&#10; &#10; The Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage&#10; he'd done.&#10; &#10; As he watched them, Jon was still curious,&#10; but he was getting mad underneath at&#10; the cold egoism of the Steel-Blues.&#10; &#10; By the shimmering clouds of Earth, by&#10; her green fields, and dark forests, he'd&#10; stay alive to warn the SP ship.&#10; &#10; Yes, he'd stay alive till then. And send&#10; the story of the Steel-Blues' corrosive acid&#10; to it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could&#10; equip themselves with spray guns and squirt&#10; citric acid and watch the Steel-Blues fade&#10; away.&#10; &#10; It sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The&#10; fruit acid of Earth to repel these invaders—it&#10; doesn't sound possible. That couldn't be&#10; the answer.&#10; &#10; Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl&#10; discovered a week later.&#10; &#10; The Steel-Blue who had captured him in&#10; the power room of the service station came&#10; in to examine him.&#10; &#10; &quot;You" />

Keeping his pistol ready, he cautiously approaches the lock leading into the service station.&#10;4. Using a key from a leg pouch on his space suit, he opens the lever housing by jabbing the key into the center of the lock.&#10;5.

The hidden entrance to the service&#10; station wasn't far off.&#10; &#10; His pistol held ready, he moved quietly&#10; on down the ravine until the old water&#10; course made an abrupt hairpin turn.&#10; &#10; Instead of following around the sharp&#10; bend, Jon Karyl moved straight ahead&#10; through the overhanging bushes until he&#10; came to a dense thicket. Dropping to his&#10; hands and knees he worked his way under&#10; the edge of the thicket into a hollowed-out&#10; space in the center.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; There&#10; , just ahead of him, was the lock&#10; leading into the service station.

It squatted&#10; like a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut&#10; tight.&#10; &#10; He tuned the televisor to its widest range&#10; and finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.&#10; He was looking into the stationary rocket&#10; engine.&#10; &#10; As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue&#10; came crawling out of the ship.&#10; &#10; The two Steel-Blues moved toward the&#10; center of the televisor range. They're coming&#10; toward the station, Karyl thought grimly.&#10; &#10; Karyl examined the two creatures.

    <node id=" He glanced back finally.&#10; &#10; Two of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting&#10; after him, and rapidly closing the&#10; distance.&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl unsheathed the stubray pistol&#10; at his side, turned the oxygen dial up for&#10; greater exertion, increased the gravity pull&#10; in his space-suit boots as he neared the&#10; ravine he'd been racing for.&#10; &#10; The oxygen was just taking hold when&#10; he hit the lip of the ravine and began&#10; sprinting through its man-high bush-strewn&#10; course.&#10; &#10; The power ray from behind ripped out&#10; great gobs of the sheltering bushes. But&#10; running naturally, bent close to the bottom&#10; of the ravine, Jon Karyl dodged the bare&#10; spots. The oxygen made the tremendous&#10; exertion easy for his lungs as he sped down&#10; the dim trail, hidden from the two steel-blue&#10; stalkers.&#10; &#10; He'd eluded them, temporarily at least,&#10; Jon Karyl decided when he finally edged off&#10; the dim trail and watched for movement&#10; along the route behind him.&#10; &#10; He stood up, finally, pushed aside the&#10; leafy overhang of a" />

    <node id=".&#10; It was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath&#10; the tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive&#10; acid.&#10; &#10; On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak&#10; he didn't feel much like moving around. He&#10; let the cylinder feed him the hemlock.&#10; &#10; No. 1 came again to see him, and went&#10; away chuckling, &quot;Decrease the dilution.&#10; This Earthman at last is beginning to&#10; suffer.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; Staying&#10; alive had now become a fetish&#10; with Jon.&#10; &#10; On the sixteenth day, the Earthman realized&#10; that the Steel-Blues also were waiting&#10; for the SP ship.&#10; &#10; The extra-terrestrials had repaired the&#10; blue ship where the service station atomic&#10; ray had struck. And they were doing a little&#10; target practice with plastic bubbles only a&#10; few miles above the asteroid.&#10; &#10; When his chronometer clocked off the&#10; beginning of the twenty-first day, Jon received&#10; a tumbler of the hemlock from the&#10; hands of No. 1 himself.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is the hemlock,&quot; he chuckled, &quot;undiluted.&#10;" />
    <node id="Jon's attempt to use a tentacle as food fails because the Steel-Blues are robots made of metal, and ingesting a part of one would not help him refuel. After being threatened with returning to the torture room, Jon uses his stubray gun to sever one of the Steel-Blue's tentacles. In response, he is placed in a 15-foot deep trench surrounded by a swath cut by the Steel-Blue. Despite this, Jon leaps over the trench and slowly walks back to the torture chamber.&#10;&#10;Once inside, the Steel-Blues repair the damage caused earlier. When they reach a circular room filled with light, Jon is examined by another Steel-Blue who confirms his identity and sentences him to death. Despite being led through more corridors and feeling paralyzed from the waist down after an encounter with a Steel-Blue in the power room, Jon remains curious about his captors. He names them &quot;Steel-Blues&quot; and learns that they are robots.&#10;&#10;On the fifth day of his torture, Jon decides to get something to eat or perish in the attempt. He successfully uses his stubray gun to break out of his goldfish bowl and heads towards his own igloo adjacent to the service station. However, he is stopped by a Steel-Blue who tells him to return to his torture. In response, Jon threatens to chew off one of its tentacles and eat it without seasoning." />
    <node id=" He pressed the red button again.&#10; &#10; Then abruptly he was on the floor of the&#10; power room, his legs strangely cut out from&#10; under him. He tried to move them.

But it couldn't&#10; happen that suddenly.&#10; &#10; He turned his head.&#10; &#10; A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked&#10; tentacle held a square black box.&#10; &#10; Jon could read nothing in that metallic&#10; face. He said, voice muffled by the confines&#10; of the plastic helmet, &quot;Who are you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am&quot;—there was a rising inflection in&#10; the answer—&quot;a Steel-Blue.&quot;&#10; &#10; There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's&#10; face to move. &quot;That is what I have named&#10; you,&quot; Jon Karyl said. &quot;But what are you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A robot,&quot; came the immediate answer.&#10; Jon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue&#10; was telepathic. &quot;Yes,&quot; the Steel-Blue answered.&#10;&quot;We" />
    <node id="Jon Karyl did not die, despite losing consciousness earlier. The Steel-Blues, an alien race, had captured him and planned to execute him using a liquid that dissolves metals. They built a miniature reproduction of Jon's service station inside an igloo and exposed him to this liquid in the same atmosphere he was used to. This method would kill him while he underwent the conditions of his normal life, as they believed he had violated their laws.&#10;&#10;During the fifth day of his ongoing torture, Jon Karyl decided that he would probably be mouldering in the rocky dust of the asteroid by that time. He was being led through corridors in the alien ship and brought to a circular room with a glass-like, bulging skylight. The Steel-Blues in the room ordered his execution, but another Steel-Blue suggested examining him first. Jon Karyl was then led away for examination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jon Karyl is still alive during the fifth day of his ongoing torture, and he is being taken to be examined before his execution." />
    <node id="Jonathan &quot;Jon&quot; Karyl, an Earthman, finds himself in a precarious situation on an asteroid where he was previously stationed for his job. He has been captured and is being kept alive by a group of extra-terrestrial beings called the Steel-Blues, who have taken control of the asteroid. &#10;&#10;As Jon's body becomes weaker, he is given hemlock to drink, which is an undiluted corrosive substance used by the Steel-Blues to dissolve metals. Although they dilute it with a harmless liquid for Jon to consume, the powerful substance causes his joints to harden and eventually turn into dust when it comes into contact with metal. The Steel-Blues are waiting for a Space Patrol (SP) ship to arrive, which is due in 21 days for refueling at Jon's service station. However, considering Jon's rapidly deteriorating condition and the Steel-Blues' advanced technology, it seems unlikely that he will be able to warn or signal the SP ship in time.&#10;&#10;In addition, the Steel-Blues have already repaired their blue ship where a service station atomic ray had struck and are now engaging in target practice with plastic bubbles just a few miles above the asteroid. They mock Jon by encouraging him to drink the undiluted hemlock and boast about their plans to enslave humanity, which further diminishes his chances of survival and thwarting their ambitions. Despite this grim scenario, Jon maintains his resolve and drinks the hemlock offered to him, hoping that the SP ship will be able to defeat the Steel-Blues' spacecraft." />
    <node id="mlock from the&#10; hands of No. 1 himself.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is the hemlock,&quot; he chuckled, &quot;undiluted.&#10; Drink it and your torture is over.&#10; You will die before your SP ship is destroyed.&#10; &#10; &quot;We have played with you long enough.&#10; Today we begin to toy with your SP ship.&#10; Drink up, Earthman, drink to enslavement.&quot;&#10; &#10; Weak though he was Jon lunged to his&#10; feet, spilling the tumbler of liquid.

    <node id="The liquid that Jon couldn't taste beneath the tang of the citric acid was actually a corrosive acid used by the Steel-Blues to dissolve metals. Initially, the Steel-Blues diluted this substance with a harmless liquid for Jon to drink so that he wouldn't die instantly. However, as time passed and Jon continued to survive, they increased the power of the hemlock and eventually gave him an undiluted dose.&#10;&#10;The relationship between this liquid and Jon's deteriorating condition is crucial. The corrosive acid causes joints to harden and eventually turns into dust when it comes into contact with metal. As Jon is force-fed increasing concentrations of hemlock, his health rapidly declines, making it difficult for him to coordinate or even warn the SP ship in time due to his weakened state. The Steel-Blues' intention was to keep Jon alive just long enough to ensure their plans were carried out before ultimately allowing him to die from the undiluted hemlock." />
    <node id="During the first five days of his &quot;torture,&quot; Jon Karyl was held captive by an alien race called the Steel-Blues on an asteroid. They had him drink a bitter liquid, which he found both familiar and tantalizing but couldn't identify. This liquid seemed to alleviate his thirst, but it didn't provide any nutrition. As Jon Karyl was unaware of the Steel-Blue's plans for him, he interpreted this experience as a form of torture, while growing increasingly conscious of his hunger. He had 20 days left before the SP ship arrived, and he wondered if the torture would last until then.&#10;&#10;However, it is essential to understand that Jon Karyl was not being tortured in the traditional sense but rather prepared for execution by the Steel-Blues. They created a miniature reproduction of his service station inside an igloo and exposed him to a liquid designed to dissolve metals, intending to kill him while maintaining the conditions of his normal life. This method serves as a form of punishment according to their laws." />

As he's running, Jon Karyl is trying to get out of sight of the strangers and cut back to head for the underground entrance to the service station. He also saves his breath as a power wave from the blue figures tears up the rocky sward to his left.&#10;3.

    <node id=" &#10; By then it was almost too late. The six&#10; blue figures were only fifty feet away, approaching&#10; him at a lope.&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl took one look and went bounding&#10; over the asteroid's rocky slopes in fifty-foot&#10; bounds.&#10; &#10; When you're a Lone Watcher, and&#10; strangers catch you unawares, you don't&#10; stand still. You move fast. It's the Watcher's&#10; first rule. Stay alive. An Earthship may depend&#10; upon your life.&#10; &#10; As he fled, Jon Karyl cursed softly under&#10; his breath. The automatic alarm should have&#10; shrilled out a warning.&#10; &#10; Then he saved as much of his breath as&#10; he could as some sort of power wave tore&#10; up the rocky sward to his left. He twisted&#10; and zig-zagged in his flight, trying to get&#10; out of sight of the strangers.&#10; &#10; Once hidden from their eyes, he could cut&#10; back and head for the underground entrance&#10; to the service station.&#10; &#10; He glanced back finally.&#10; &#10; Two of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting&#10; after him, and rapidly closing the&#10; distance." />
    <node id="The significance of Jon drinking the hemlock offered by No. 1 is that it symbolizes his acceptance of his fate and his determination to die on his own terms. The hemlock is a corrosive acid that the Steel-Blues have been giving him in increasingly potent concentrations, causing his health to deteriorate significantly. By willingly drinking the undiluted hemlock, Jon is effectively choosing to end his life rather than continuing to suffer at the hands of his captors.&#10;&#10;This action has a profound impact on Jon's attitude and actions afterwards. Knowing that he is about to die, Jon feels a sense of exultation that deadens his hunger and washes away his nausea. He also experiences a renewed sense of purpose and determination, as evidenced by his final words before drinking the hemlock: &quot;To Earth, ever triumphant.&quot; This statement suggests that Jon is choosing to die with dignity and courage, symbolizing his unwavering loyalty to his home planet and his refusal to be broken by his captors.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jon's decision to drink the hemlock also has strategic implications. By doing so, he effectively thwarts the Steel-Blues' plans to keep him alive just long enough to ensure their own survival. Additionally, his actions may serve as a warning to the SP ship, alerting them to the presence of the Steel-Blues and their nefarious intentions.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jon drinking the hemlock offered by No. 1 is a powerful moment that symbolizes his courage, determination, and unwavering loyalty to his home planet. It also has strategic implications and may serve as a warning to the SP ship, ultimately contributing to the ongoing battle between the two forces." />
    <node id=" glass-like cap from the tumbler&#10; of liquid.&#10; &#10; Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering&#10; an old fairy tale he'd read as a kid.&#10; Something about a fellow named Socrates&#10; who was given a cup of hemlock to drink.&#10; It was the finis for Socrates. But the old&#10; hero had been nonchalant and calm about&#10; the whole thing.&#10; &#10; With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious&#10; unto death, relaxed and said, &quot;All right,&#10; bub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll&#10; take it like a man.&quot;&#10; &#10; The cylinder apparently understood him,&#10; for it handed him the tumbler. It even reholstered&#10; his stubray pistol.&#10; &#10; Jon brought the glass of liquid under his&#10; nose. The fumes of the liquid were pungent.&#10; It brought tears to his eyes.&#10; &#10; He looked at the cylinder, then at the&#10; Steel-Blues crowding around the plastic&#10; igloo. He waved the glass at the audience.&#10; &#10; &quot;To Earth, ever triumphant,&quot; he toasted.&#10; Then he drained the glass at a gulp.&#10; " />

Keeping his pistol ready, he cautiously approaches the lock leading into the service station and uses a key from a leg pouch on his space suit to open it." />
    <node id="The story does not provide enough information to definitively determine the origin of the ship that Jon Karyl and Captain Small destroyed with atomic fire. The ship is referred to as &quot;weakening&quot; and &quot;melting away&quot; under the atomic fire, suggesting it may have been made of a less durable material than human-made ships. However, the story does not provide any details about the ship's origin or the identity of its occupants. Similarly, the text does not offer enough information to determine why the occupants of the ship mistook Jon Karyl for a metal creature." />
    <node id=" so we just poured atomic fire&#10; into the weakening ship. It just melted&#10; away.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon Karyl got up from the divan where&#10; he'd been lying. &quot;They thought I was a&#10; metal creature, too. But where do you suppose&#10; they came from?&quot;&#10; &#10; The captain shrugged. &quot;Who knows?&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon set two glasses on the table.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have a drink of the best damn water in&#10; the solar system?&quot; He asked Capt. Small.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't mind if I do.&quot;&#10; &#10; The water twinkled in the two glasses,&#10; winking as if it knew just what it had&#10; done." />
    <node id="At the beginning, Jon Karyl initially considered using citric acid from Earth as a potential solution to repel the Steel-Blues, since they seemed vulnerable to corrosive substances. However, a week later, he determined that citric acid was not the answer after all. This is because the Steel-Blue who had captured him mentioned that they communicate through telepathy and can read Jon's thoughts, meaning they could still anticipate his plans even if he managed to acquire citric acid for use as a weapon. Moreover, when the Steel-Blues repaired the damage Jon caused to their ship, they showed no signs of vulnerability to Earth's fruit acid." />
    <node id=" the immediate answer.&#10; Jon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue&#10; was telepathic. &quot;Yes,&quot; the Steel-Blue answered.&#10;&quot;We talk in the language of the&#10; mind. Come!&quot; he said peremptorily, motioning&#10; with the square black box.&#10; &#10; The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed&#10; the Steel-Blue, aware that the lens&#10; he'd seen on the creature's face had a&#10; counterpart on the back of the egg-head.&#10; &#10; Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.&#10; That's quite an innovation. &quot;Thank you,&quot;&#10; Steel-Blue said.&#10; &#10; There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's&#10; mind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he&#10; had applied for this high-paying but man-killing&#10; job as a Lone Watcher on the Solar&#10; System's starways.&#10; &#10; He had little fear now, only curiosity.&#10; These Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.&#10; They could have snuffed out my life very&#10; simply.

    <node id="The Steel-Blues have determined that Jon Karyl will be executed for being a violator of their laws. This is evident when they order his execution after identifying him as the violator. However, one of the Steel-Blues suggests examining him first, which leads to Jon being led away for examination.&#10;&#10;The guide might be advocating for Jon to be examined first before being subjected to the penalty because he may have some doubts about Jon's guilt or wants to ensure that the correct punishment is meted out. By examining Jon, they can gather more information about him and his actions, which could potentially influence the outcome of his sentencing. The guide may also be motivated by compassion or a sense of justice, as examining Jon before executing him allows for a fairer process and gives him a chance to defend himself or provide additional context for his actions." />
    <node id="What had kept Karyl alive after being fed what he thought was sure death is a liquid that turns out to be acid, which the Steel-Blues (the alien race) feared because it would rust their joints, short their wiring, and kill them. The Steel-Blues initially planned to execute Karyl by exposing him to this acid in the same atmosphere he was used to, believing he had violated their laws. However, since they are metal-based life forms, this acid is lethal to them but not to Karyl, who is an organic being. This acid kept Karyl alive as it replaced the need for water and alleviated his thirst during his captivity, though it did not provide any nutrition. The Steel-Blues feared this liquid because of its corrosive properties, which ultimately led to their demise when SP-101's crew used a shell of water as a projectile, causing the alien ship to oxidize and melt away." />

You're among&#10; friends.&quot;&#10; &#10; He pried open his eyes with his will. He&#10; saw the blue and gold of a space guard's&#10; uniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; He was&#10; still weak days later when&#10; Capt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, Karyl, it's ironical.

But when I drank that last&#10; glass, I knew they didn't have a chance.&#10; &#10; &quot;They were metal monsters. No wonder&#10; they feared that liquid.

    <node id="The Steel-Blues are an alien race that has captured Jon Karyl. They are described as robotic creatures with a metallic face, egg-shaped heads, and walking appendages. One of the Steel-Blues explicitly states that they are a robot. They have the ability to communicate telepathically, as evidenced by their ability to read Jon's thoughts and respond to his questions without moving their faces or using verbal language. This is demonstrated when one Steel-Blue communicates with Jon through &quot;the language of the mind&quot; and responds to his thoughts with appropriate answers. They also seem to have advanced technology, such as a black box that can cause paralysis and lenses on the back of their heads that function like eyes." />
    <node id="The Steel-Blue's revelation about their ship's force field highlights the fact that Jon Karyl's pistol, which fires atomic guns, will not be effective against them. This information reinforces the story's earlier mention of the Steel-Blues being prepared for any attempts Jon might make using his pistol and that they can probably anticipate his plans. The force field specifically designed to deflect Jon's atomic guns further reduces his chances of harming the Steel-Blues or their ship, making it more challenging for him to warn the SP ship while staying alive. It emphasizes Jon's seemingly impossible situation, as he needs to find an alternative way to warn the SP ship and ensure his survival." />
    <node id="In his encounter with the rapidly moving cylindrical object, which is revealed to be an extra-terrestrial being known as a Steel-Blue, Jon tries to defend himself by unsheathing a stubray gun and preparing to blast it. However, he is overpowered when one of the tentacles spears the gun from his hand and four tentacles pinion him down, preventing him from moving. The Steel-Blue then removes the glass-like cap from the tumbler containing an acid-like liquid.&#10;&#10;Instead of forcing Jon to drink the corrosive substance, the Steel-Blues appear to show mercy by allowing Jon to take off his helmet and gulp huge draughts of air, suggesting that they have diluted the acid with a harmless liquid for him to drink. They then wait for the torture to begin, but Jon remains unharmed, causing him to think that the excess of oxygen is making him light-headed.&#10;&#10;The Steel-Blue presents Jon with another tumbler containing a yellowish liquid, which turns out to be a substance used by the extra-terrestrial beings to dissolve metals. However, it does not harm Jon as the Steel-Blues have diluted it again. After drinking the liquid, Jon is led through corridors and eventually enters a circular room where he meets another Steel-Blue who speaks out and confirms that Jon knows the penalty for being an intruder in their ship. However, the first Steel-Blue who gave Jon the liquid requests to examine him first before giving him the death penalty.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jon's encounter with the rapidly moving cylindrical object results in a surprising turn of events where he is not harmed but given liquids that appear harmful but are actually harmless due to dilution. This suggests that the Steel-Blues may have a different sense of justice and mercy than what Jon initially expected, leading to his eventual examination rather than instant death." />

He raised to his feet.&#10; &#10; He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared&#10; to blast the cylinder.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; The&#10; cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his&#10; eyes jump in his head.

The Steel-Blues have advanced technology, such as a black box that can cause paralysis and lenses on the back of their heads that function like eyes. They are attempting to gain entry into the station where Jon is located, possibly to harm or capture him. However, Jon manages to lock himself inside the power room, and one Steel-Blue is unable to open the door with its tentacle and black box.

They&#10; were of the steel-blue color from the crown&#10; of their egg-shaped heads to the tips of&#10; their walking appendages.&#10; &#10; They were about the height of Karyl—six&#10; feet. But where he tapered from broad&#10; shoulders to flat hips, they were straight up&#10; and down. They had no legs, just appendages,&#10; many-jointed that stretched and&#10; shrank independent of the other, but keeping&#10; the cylindrical body with its four pairs&#10; of tentacles on a level balance.&#10; &#10; Where their eyes would have been was&#10; an elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the&#10; egg-head, with its converging ends curving&#10; around the sides of the head.&#10; &#10; Robots!

The Steel-Blues have a liquid designed to dissolve metals, which they plan to use on him in the atmosphere of his service station igloo. This will cause his joints to harden and eventually disintegrate into dust.&#10;&#10;2. Jon Karyl is considering two options for handling this situation, neither of which involves using his stubray pistol. Firstly, he could find a hiding place on the asteroid, but the Steel-Blues could potentially tear the entire place apart to find him. Secondly, he could attempt to hide in the little life ship within the service station; however, this would make him an easy target.&#10;&#10;3. After evaluating these options and his curiosity about the Steel-Blues' plans, Jon Karyl decides not to use his pistol and waits for further developments." />
    <node id="The substance that the Steel-Blues force Jon to drink is a corrosive acid they use to dissolve metals. Initially, they dilute it with a harmless liquid so that Jon won't die instantly. However, as time passes and Jon continues to survive, they increase the power of the hemlock and eventually give him an undiluted dose. This substance causes Jon's health to rapidly decline, making it difficult for him to coordinate or even warn the SP ship in time due to his weakened state. The Steel-Blues intend to keep Jon alive just long enough to ensure their plans are carried out before ultimately allowing him to die from the undiluted hemlock." />
    <node id="The likelihood of Jon successfully warning the SP ship seems quite low, given the Steel-Blues' advanced technology and preparation. They have demonstrated their ability to delve deeper than the surface of Jon's mind, which suggests they can anticipate his plans. Moreover, their ship is equipped with a force field specifically designed to deflect Jon's atomic guns, rendering his pistol ineffective. The Steel-Blues' mocking encouragement for Jon to drink the hemlock and their boasts about enslaving humanity further diminish his chances of survival and thwarting their ambitions. Although Jon maintains his resolve and drinks the hemlock, hoping that the SP ship will defeat the Steel-Blues' spacecraft, it appears unlikely based on the information provided." />
    <node id="1. After Jon Karyl decides to drink the pungent liquid, he realizes that it is water, which revives him and helps him regain his strength.&#10;2. The Steel-Blues had replaced the deadly metal-dissolving liquid with water after observing Jon Karyl's resilience during their initial attempts at &quot;torture.&quot;&#10;3. Jon Karyl's decision to drink the water allows him to escape from the igloo and reclaim his stubray pistol, which he uses to threaten the Steel-Blues and make his escape.&#10;4. Eventually, Jon Karyl is rescued by Captain Small and the SP ship, and he shares a glass of this &quot;best damn water in the solar system&quot; with the captain." />

Knowing that he is about to die, Jon feels a sense of exultation that deadens his hunger and washes away his nausea. He also experiences a renewed sense of purpose and determination, as evidenced by his final words before drinking the hemlock: &quot;To Earth, ever triumphant.&quot; This statement suggests that Jon is choosing to die with dignity and courage, symbolizing his unwavering loyalty to his home planet and his refusal to be broken by his captors.&#10;&#10;Jon's decision to drink the hemlock also has strategic implications. By doing so, he effectively thwarts the Steel-Blues' plans to keep him alive just long enough to ensure their own survival. Additionally, his actions may serve as a warning to the SP ship, alerting them to the presence of the Steel-Blues and their nefarious intentions.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jon drinking the hemlock offered by No. 1 is a powerful moment that symbolizes his courage, determination, and unwavering loyalty to his home planet. It also has strategic implications and may serve as a warning to the SP ship, ultimately contributing to the ongoing battle between the two forces." />
    <node id="Jon cut off one of Steel-Blue's tentacles in response to being threatened with returning to the torture room. He did this as an act of defiance and also because he thought that the Steel-Blues were organic beings, and by cutting off a tentacle, he could use it as food to refuel his body. However, after cutting off the tentacle, he realized that the Steel-Blues were robots made of metal, and ingesting a part of one would not help him refuel. After this incident, Jon was placed in a 15-foot deep trench surrounded by a swath cut by the Steel-Blue. Despite this, Jon leaped over the trench and slowly walked back to the torture chamber.&#10;&#10;Once inside, the Steel-Blues repaired the damage caused earlier and eventually took Jon to be examined by another Steel-Blue in a circular room filled with light. It was there that he was confirmed as an inhabitant of this system and sentenced to death.

He names them &quot;Steel-Blues&quot; and learns that they are robots.&#10;&#10;On the fifth day of his torture, Jon decided to get something to eat or perish in the attempt. He successfully used his stubray gun to break out of his goldfish bowl and heads towards his own igloo adjacent to the service station. However, he is stopped by a Steel-Blue who tells him to return to his torture. In response, Jon threatened to chew off one of its tentacles and eat it without seasoning.

As Jon Karyl was unaware of the Steel-Blue's plans for him, he interpreted this experience as a form of torture, while growing increasingly conscious of his hunger. He had 20 days left before the SP ship arrived, and he wondered if the torture would last until then.&#10;&#10;However, it is essential to understand that Jon Karyl was not being tortured in the traditional sense but rather prepared for execution by the Steel-Blues. They created a miniature reproduction of his service station inside an igloo and exposed him to a liquid designed to dissolve metals, intending to kill him while maintaining the conditions of his normal life. This method serves as a form of punishment according to their laws.">

Knowing that he is about to die, Jon feels a sense of exultation that deadens his hunger and washes away his nausea. He also experiences a renewed sense of purpose and determination, as evidenced by his final words before drinking the hemlock: &quot;To Earth, ever triumphant.&quot; This statement suggests that Jon is choosing to die with dignity and courage, symbolizing his unwavering loyalty to his home planet and his refusal to be broken by his captors.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jon's decision to drink the hemlock also has strategic implications. By doing so, he effectively thwarts the Steel-Blues' plans to keep him alive just long enough to ensure their own survival. Additionally, his actions may serve as a warning to the SP ship, alerting them to the presence of the Steel-Blues and their nefarious intentions.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jon drinking the hemlock offered by No. 1 is a powerful moment that symbolizes his courage, determination, and unwavering loyalty to his home planet. It also has strategic implications and may serve as a warning to the SP ship, ultimately contributing to the ongoing battle between the two forces.">

This will cause his joints to harden and eventually disintegrate into dust.&#10;&#10;2. Jon Karyl is considering two options for handling this situation, neither of which involves using his stubray pistol. Firstly, he could find a hiding place on the asteroid, but the Steel-Blues could potentially tear the entire place apart to find him. Secondly, he could attempt to hide in the little life ship within the service station; however, this would make him an easy target.&#10;&#10;3. After evaluating these options and his curiosity about the Steel-Blues' plans, Jon Karyl decides not to use his pistol and waits for further developments.">

    <edge source="During the first five days of his &quot;torture,&quot; Jon Karyl was held captive by an alien race called the Steel-Blues on an asteroid. They had him drink a bitter liquid, which he found both familiar and tantalizing but couldn't identify. This liquid seemed to alleviate his thirst, but it didn't provide any nutrition. As Jon Karyl was unaware of the Steel-Blue's plans for him, he interpreted this experience as a form of torture, while growing increasingly conscious of his hunger. He had 20 days left before the SP ship arrived, and he wondered if the torture would last until then.&#10;&#10;However, it is essential to understand that Jon Karyl was not being tortured in the traditional sense but rather prepared for execution by the Steel-Blues. They created a miniature reproduction of his service station inside an igloo and exposed him to a liquid designed to dissolve metals, intending to kill him while maintaining the conditions of his normal life. This method serves as a form of punishment according to their laws." target="1. After Jon Karyl decides to drink the pungent liquid, he realizes that it is water, which revives him and helps him regain his strength.&#10;2. The Steel-Blues had replaced the deadly metal-dissolving liquid with water after observing Jon Karyl's resilience during their initial attempts at &quot;torture.&quot;&#10;3. Jon Karyl's decision to drink the water allows him to escape from the igloo and reclaim his stubray pistol, which he uses to threaten the Steel-Blues and make his escape.&#10;4. Eventually, Jon Karyl is rescued by Captain Small and the SP ship, and he shares a glass of this &quot;best damn water in the solar system&quot; with the captain.">

The Steel-Blue then removes the glass-like cap from the tumbler containing an acid-like liquid.&#10;&#10;Instead of forcing Jon to drink the corrosive substance, the Steel-Blues appear to show mercy by allowing Jon to take off his helmet and gulp huge draughts of air, suggesting that they have diluted the acid with a harmless liquid for him to drink. They then wait for the torture to begin, but Jon remains unharmed, causing him to think that the excess of oxygen is making him light-headed.&#10;&#10;The Steel-Blue presents Jon with another tumbler containing a yellowish liquid, which turns out to be a substance used by the extra-terrestrial beings to dissolve metals. However, it does not harm Jon as the Steel-Blues have diluted it again.

    <edge source="The likelihood of Jon successfully warning the SP ship seems quite low, given the Steel-Blues' advanced technology and preparation. They have demonstrated their ability to delve deeper than the surface of Jon's mind, which suggests they can anticipate his plans. Moreover, their ship is equipped with a force field specifically designed to deflect Jon's atomic guns, rendering his pistol ineffective. The Steel-Blues' mocking encouragement for Jon to drink the hemlock and their boasts about enslaving humanity further diminish his chances of survival and thwarting their ambitions. Although Jon maintains his resolve and drinks the hemlock, hoping that the SP ship will defeat the Steel-Blues' spacecraft, it appears unlikely based on the information provided." target="The significance of Jon drinking the hemlock offered by No. 1 is that it symbolizes his acceptance of his fate and his determination to die on his own terms. The hemlock is a corrosive acid that has been causing Jon's health to deteriorate significantly, and by willingly drinking the undiluted hemlock, he is effectively choosing to end his life rather than continuing to suffer at the hands of his captors.&#10;&#10;Despite his weakened state, Jon's decision to drink the hemlock has a profound impact on his attitude. Knowing that he is about to die, Jon feels a sense of exultation that deadens his hunger and washes away his nausea. He also experiences a renewed sense of purpose and determination, as evidenced by his final words before drinking the hemlock: &quot;To Earth, ever triumphant.&quot; This statement suggests that Jon is choosing to die with dignity and courage, symbolizing his unwavering loyalty to his home planet and his refusal to be broken by his captors.&#10;&#10;Jon's decision to drink the hemlock also has strategic implications.

    <edge source="1. The story does not provide enough information to definitively determine the origin of the ship that Jon Karyl and Captain Small destroyed with atomic fire, or why the occupants of the ship mistook Jon Karyl for a metal creature.&#10;2. Jon Karyl enters a service station using a key from his space suit, and later shares a drink of water with Captain Small.&#10;3. The Steel-Blues, who have the ability to read minds, express an interest in using Earth's planets for their own purposes.&#10;4. It is unlikely that Jon Karyl will be able to successfully warn the SP ship while staying alive, due to the Steel-Blues' ability to anticipate his plans and deflect his atomic guns." target=" simply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be&#10; friends.&#10; &#10; Steel-Blue chuckled.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; Jon&#10; followed him through the sundered&#10; lock of the station. Karyl stopped for a&#10; moment to examine the wreckage of the&#10; lock. It had been punched full of holes as&#10; if it had been some soft cheese instead of a&#10; metal which Earthmen had spent nearly a&#10; century perfecting.&#10; &#10; &quot;We appreciate your compliment,&quot; Steel-Blue&#10; said. &quot;But that metal also is found on&#10; our world. It's probably the softest and most&#10; malleable we have. We were surprised you—earthmen,&#10; is it?—use it as protective&#10; metal.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why are you in this system?&quot; Jon asked,&#10; hardly expecting an answer.&#10; &#10; It came anyway. &quot;For the same reason you&#10; Earthmen are reaching out farther into your&#10; system. We need living room. You have&#10; strategically placed planets for our use. We&#10; will use them.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had&#10; been preaching preparedness as Earth flung&#10; her ships into the reaches of the solar system,&#10; taking the first long step toward the&#10; conquest">

    <edge source="The unexpected and strange event happening on the asteroid involves the arrival of six Steel-Blue creatures in a peculiar blue space ship. These aliens plan to execute Jon Karyl using a liquid that dissolves metals, as they believe he has violated their laws. They have built a miniature reproduction of Jon's service station inside an igloo and exposed him to this liquid in the same atmosphere he is used to, intending to kill him while he undergoes the conditions of his normal life. On the fifth day of his ongoing torture, Jon Karyl is being taken for examination before his scheduled execution. The Steel-Blues are described as robotic creatures with advanced technology and the ability to communicate telepathically." target="ACID BATH&#10; &#10;&#10; By VASELEOS GARSON&#10; &#10; &#10;  The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments&#10; in his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid. But nothing like the&#10; weird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.&#10;  &#10;&#10;&#10; Jon Karyl&#10; was bolting in a new baffle&#10; plate on the stationary rocket engine.&#10; It was a tedious job and took all his&#10; concentration. So he wasn't paying too much&#10; attention to what was going on in other&#10; parts of the little asteroid.&#10; &#10; He didn't see the peculiar blue space&#10; ship, its rockets throttled down, as it drifted&#10; to land only a few hundred yards away from&#10; his plastic igloo.&#10; &#10; Nor did he see the half-dozen steel-blue&#10; creatures slide out of the peculiar vessel's&#10; airlock.&#10; &#10; It was only as he crawled out of the&#10; depths of the rocket power plant that he&#10; realized something was wrong.&#10; &#10; By then it was almost too late. The six&#10; blue figures were only fifty feet away, approaching&#10; him at a lope.&#10; &#10;">

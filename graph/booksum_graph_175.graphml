    <node id="The evening's activities for the girls involved putting away their card game and Mr. Crawley's books, then taking turns reading a long sermon delivered at Bethesda Chapel, Liverpool, on behalf of the mission for the Chickasaw Indians. This was overseen by Mr. Crawley, who wanted to evaluate their reading skills and ensure that Miss Sharp, the new governess, had an opportunity to hear them read. After they finished reading, the household, including Sir Pitt, were called to prayers at ten o'clock in the evening. The purpose of these activities was to engage the girls in a more educational and improving pastime, centered around religious teachings and self-improvement." />
    <node id=" had my&#10;choice of amusement between a volume of sermons, and a pamphlet on the&#10;corn-laws, which Mr. Crawley had been reading before dinner.&#10;&#10;So we sat for an hour until steps were heard.&#10;&#10;&quot;Put away the cards, girls,&quot; cried my lady, in a great tremor; &quot;put&#10;down Mr. Crawley's books, Miss Sharp&quot;; and these orders had been&#10;scarcely obeyed, when Mr. Crawley entered the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;We will resume yesterday's discourse, young ladies,&quot; said he, &quot;and you&#10;shall each read a page by turns; so that Miss a--Miss Short may have an&#10;opportunity of hearing you&quot;; and the poor girls began to spell a long&#10;dismal sermon delivered at Bethesda Chapel, Liverpool, on behalf of the&#10;mission for the Chickasaw Indians. Was it not a charming evening?&#10;&#10;At ten the servants were told to call Sir Pitt and the household to&#10;prayers.  Sir Pitt came in first, very much flushed, and rather&#10;unsteady in his gait; and after him the butler, the canaries, Mr.&#10;Crawley's man, three other men, smelling" />
    <node id=" note,&quot; Miss Sharp said with a laugh; and Rawdon Crawley&#10;fumed with rage and mortification.&#10;&#10;Seeing the evident partiality of Miss Crawley for the new governess,&#10;how good it was of Mrs. Bute Crawley not to be jealous, and to welcome&#10;the young lady to the Rectory, and not only her, but Rawdon Crawley,&#10;her husband's rival in the Old Maid's five per cents! They became very&#10;fond of each other's society, Mrs. Crawley and her nephew.  He gave up&#10;hunting; he declined entertainments at Fuddleston: he would not dine&#10;with the mess of the depot at Mudbury: his great pleasure was to stroll&#10;over to Crawley parsonage--whither Miss Crawley came too; and as their&#10;mamma was ill, why not the children with Miss Sharp? So the children&#10;(little dears!) came with Miss Sharp; and of an evening some of the&#10;party would walk back together.  Not Miss Crawley--she preferred her&#10;carriage--but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little&#10;park wicket, and through the dark plantation, and" />
    <node id=". Crawley, &quot;your laughter&#10;strikes me as being exceedingly out of place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind, my lord,&quot; said the Baronet, &quot;we'll try the porker on&#10;Saturday.  Kill un on Saturday morning, John Horrocks.  Miss Sharp&#10;adores pork, don't you, Miss Sharp?&quot;&#10;&#10;And I think this is all the conversation that I remember at dinner.&#10;When the repast was concluded a jug of hot water was placed before Sir&#10;Pitt, with a case-bottle containing, I believe, rum.  Mr. Horrocks&#10;served myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine, and a&#10;bumper was poured out for my lady.  When we retired, she took from her&#10;work-drawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting; the young&#10;ladies began to play at cribbage with a dirty pack of cards.  We had&#10;but one candle lighted, but it was in a magnificent old silver&#10;candlestick, and after a very few questions from my lady, I had my&#10;choice of amusement between a volume of sermons, and a pamphlet on the&#10;corn-laws, which Mr. Crawley had been reading before" />
    <node id=" delicate. I&#10;must familiarise my style--but she understands it.  Her mother was a&#10;Montmorency.&quot;&#10;&#10;Indeed it was from this famous family, as it appears, that Miss Sharp,&#10;by the mother's side, was descended. Of course she did not say that her&#10;mother had been on the stage; it would have shocked Mr. Crawley's&#10;religious scruples.  How many noble emigres had this horrid revolution&#10;plunged in poverty!  She had several stories about her ancestors ere&#10;she had been many months in the house; some of which Mr. Crawley&#10;happened to find in D'Hozier's dictionary, which was in the library,&#10;and which strengthened his belief in their truth, and in the&#10;high-breeding of Rebecca.  Are we to suppose from this curiosity and&#10;prying into dictionaries, could our heroine suppose that Mr. Crawley&#10;was interested in her?--no, only in a friendly way.  Have we not stated&#10;that he was attached to Lady Jane Sheepshanks?&#10;&#10;He took Rebecca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at&#10;backgammon with Sir Pitt, saying that" />
    <node id="ness, profaneness, and folly.&quot; In fact, the old lady declined&#10;altogether to hear his hour's lecture of an evening; and when she came&#10;to Queen's Crawley alone, he was obliged to pretermit his usual&#10;devotional exercises.&#10;&#10;&quot;Shut up your sarmons, Pitt, when Miss Crawley comes down,&quot; said his&#10;father; &quot;she has written to say that she won't stand the preachifying.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O, sir! consider the servants.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The servants be hanged,&quot; said Sir Pitt; and his son thought even worse&#10;would happen were they deprived of the benefit of his instruction.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, hang it, Pitt!&quot; said the father to his remonstrance. &quot;You&#10;wouldn't be such a flat as to let three thousand a year go out of the&#10;family?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What is money compared to our souls, sir?&quot; continued Mr. Crawley.&#10;&#10;&quot;You mean that the old lady won't leave the money to you?&quot;--and who&#10;knows but it was Mr. Crawley's meaning?&#10;&#10;Old Miss Crawley was certainly one of the reprobate. She had a snug&#10;little house in Park" />
    <node id=" pester their young brains with too much&#10;learning, but, on the contrary, let them have their own way in regard&#10;to educating themselves; for what instruction is more effectual than&#10;self-instruction? The eldest was rather fond of books, and as there was&#10;in the old library at Queen's Crawley a considerable provision of works&#10;of light literature of the last century, both in the French and English&#10;languages (they had been purchased by the Secretary of the Tape and&#10;Sealing Wax Office at the period of his disgrace), and as nobody ever&#10;troubled the bookshelves but herself, Rebecca was enabled agreeably,&#10;and, as it were, in playing, to impart a great deal of instruction to&#10;Miss Rose Crawley.&#10;&#10;She and Miss Rose thus read together many delightful French and English&#10;works, among which may be mentioned those of the learned Dr. Smollett,&#10;of the ingenious Mr. Henry Fielding, of the graceful and fantastic&#10;Monsieur Crebillon the younger, whom our immortal poet Gray so much&#10;admired, and of the universal Monsieur de Voltaire. Once, when Mr.&#10;Crawley asked what the young people were reading," />
    <node id="1. Extravagant legal expenses: The man had a taste for law, which cost him thousands of pounds annually. His cleverness made him believe he wouldn't be cheated by any single agent, leading him to mistrust multiple agents who mismanaged his affairs.&#10;&#10;2. Sharp practices as a landlord and farmer: He was so strict with tenants that only bankrupt ones could be found, and he begrudged even the seed for planting crops. This resulted in poor crop yields due to Nature's revenge.&#10;&#10;3. Reckless financial speculation: The man engaged in various business ventures such as mining, buying canal-shares, horsing coaches, taking government contracts, and owning a granite quarry â€“ all of which either failed or caused financial strain.&#10;&#10;4. Unpaid debts and mistreatment of creditors: His unwillingness to pay his debts on time gave him satisfaction in making creditors wait and shift payment dates. This behavior was facilitated by his position as a parliamentarian, which he saw as an advantage for delaying debt payments.&#10;&#10;5. Controversial personal character: Despite being uneducated and lacking taste or refinement, the man held significant rank, honors, and power in England due to his noble name and property. However, his cunning, meanness, selfishness, foolishness, and disreputable nature were widely criticized.&#10;&#10;6. Family financial obligations: Owing money to his son from his late wife's jointure further strained his finances, causing him to avoid paying debts when possible.&#10;&#10;Overall, the man's intelligence and ambition were overshadowed by his extravagant spending, poor business decisions, mistreatment of creditors, and personal controversies, preventing significant financial success and influence." />
    <node id=" no capital but his brains, it is very possible that he would have&#10;turned them to good account, and might have achieved for himself a very&#10;considerable influence and competency. But he was unluckily endowed&#10;with a good name and a large though encumbered estate, both of which&#10;went rather to injure than to advance him.  He had a taste for law,&#10;which cost him many thousands yearly; and being a great deal too clever&#10;to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his affairs to&#10;be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all equally mistrusted. He was such a&#10;sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants; and&#10;such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the ground,&#10;whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she granted to&#10;more liberal husbandmen. He speculated in every possible way; he worked&#10;mines; bought canal-shares; horsed coaches; took government contracts,&#10;and was the busiest man and magistrate of his county.  As he would not&#10;pay honest agents at his granite quarry, he had the satisfaction of&#10;finding that four overseers ran away, and took fortunes with" />
    <node id=" his&#10;debts.  Miss Sharp calculated (for she became, as we shall hear&#10;speedily, inducted into most of the secrets of the family) that the&#10;mere payment of his creditors cost the honourable Baronet several&#10;hundreds yearly; but this was a delight he could not forego; he had a&#10;savage pleasure in making the poor wretches wait, and in shifting from&#10;court to court and from term to term the period of satisfaction.&#10;What's the good of being in Parliament, he said, if you must pay your&#10;debts? Hence, indeed, his position as a senator was not a little useful&#10;to him.&#10;&#10;Vanity Fair--Vanity Fair!  Here was a man, who could not spell, and did&#10;not care to read--who had the habits and the cunning of a boor: whose&#10;aim in life was pettifogging: who never had a taste, or emotion, or&#10;enjoyment, but what was sordid and foul; and yet he had rank, and&#10;honours, and power, somehow: and was a dignitary of the land, and a&#10;pillar of the state.  He was high sheriff, and rode in" />
    <node id="with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour.  His&#10;politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca&#10;Sharp--in a word, the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England,&#10;did not contain a more cunning, mean, selfish, foolish, disreputable&#10;old man.  That blood-red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in&#10;anybody's pocket except his own; and it is with grief and pain, that,&#10;as admirers of the British aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to&#10;admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is&#10;in Debrett.&#10;&#10;One great cause why Mr. Crawley had such a hold over the affections of&#10;his father, resulted from money arrangements.  The Baronet owed his son&#10;a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother, which he did not find&#10;it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to&#10;paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to discharge his&#10;debts.  Miss Sharp calculated (for she became, as we shall hear&#10;speedily, inducted into most of the secrets of the family" />
    <node id=", and power, somehow: and was a dignitary of the land, and a&#10;pillar of the state.  He was high sheriff, and rode in a golden coach.&#10;Great ministers and statesmen courted him; and in Vanity Fair he had a&#10;higher place than the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt had an unmarried half-sister who inherited her mother's large&#10;fortune, and though the Baronet proposed to borrow this money of her on&#10;mortgage, Miss Crawley declined the offer, and preferred the security&#10;of the funds. She had signified, however, her intention of leaving her&#10;inheritance between Sir Pitt's second son and the family at the&#10;Rectory, and had once or twice paid the debts of Rawdon Crawley in his&#10;career at college and in the army. Miss Crawley was, in consequence, an&#10;object of great respect when she came to Queen's Crawley, for she had a&#10;balance at her banker's which would have made her beloved anywhere.&#10;&#10;What a dignity it gives an old lady, that balance at the banker's! How&#10;tenderly we look at her faults if she is a relative (and may every&#10;reader have" />
    <node id=" an&#10;adept in all these noble sciences.  And though he belonged to the&#10;household troops, who, as it was their duty to rally round the Prince&#10;Regent, had not shown their valour in foreign service yet, Rawdon&#10;Crawley had already (apropos of play, of which he was immoderately&#10;fond) fought three bloody duels, in which he gave ample proofs of his&#10;contempt for death.&#10;&#10;&quot;And for what follows after death,&quot; would Mr. Crawley observe, throwing&#10;his gooseberry-coloured eyes up to the ceiling.  He was always thinking&#10;of his brother's soul, or of the souls of those who differed with him&#10;in opinion: it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give&#10;themselves.&#10;&#10;Silly, romantic Miss Crawley, far from being horrified at the courage&#10;of her favourite, always used to pay his debts after his duels; and&#10;would not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality.&#10;&quot;He will sow his wild oats,&quot; she would say, &quot;and is worth far more than&#10;that puling hypocrite of a brother of his.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Arcadian Simplicity&#10;" />
    <node id=" little&#10;pink-faced chit Amelia, with not half my sense, has ten thousand pounds&#10;and an establishment secure, poor Rebecca (and my figure is far better&#10;than hers) has only herself and her own wits to trust to.  Well, let us&#10;see if my wits cannot provide me with an honourable maintenance, and if&#10;some day or the other I cannot show Miss Amelia my real superiority&#10;over her. Not that I dislike poor Amelia: who can dislike such a&#10;harmless, good-natured creature?--only it will be a fine day when I can&#10;take my place above her in the world, as why, indeed, should I not?&quot;&#10;Thus it was that our little romantic friend formed visions of the&#10;future for herself--nor must we be scandalised that, in all her castles&#10;in the air, a husband was the principal inhabitant.  Of what else have&#10;young ladies to think, but husbands? Of what else do their dear mammas&#10;think?  &quot;I must be my own mamma,&quot; said Rebecca; not without a tingling&#10;consciousness of defeat, as she thought over her little misadventure&#10;with Jos Sedley.&#10;&#10;So" />
    <node id="The arrival of Mr. Crawley, the son of Sir Pitt, brought about significant changes in the behavior and respect shown by the household members at Queen's Crawley. His father, Sir Pitt, began to show more restraint in his language and manners, especially in front of Lady Crawley. The butler, Horrocks, became more attentive, and even Sir Pitt started wearing cleaner gaiters and avoided drinking rum-and-water in his son's presence.&#10;&#10;Mr. Crawley introduced a higher standard of formality and respect in the household. He taught the butler to say &quot;My lady is served&quot; and insisted on handing Lady Crawley in to dinner, showing her immense respect. In addition, he never let her leave the room without standing up and making an elegant bow.&#10;&#10;During his time at Eton, Mr. Crawley was called &quot;Miss Crawley,&quot; and his younger brother, Rawdon, often licked him violently. Although his intellectual abilities were not brilliant, he possessed a certain charm, dignity, and power that earned him respect. He grew to become a dignitary of the land and a pillar of the state, holding positions such as high sheriff and riding in a golden coach. Ministers and statesmen courted him, and in Vanity Fair, he held a higher place than many with more brilliant genius or spotless virtue." />
    <node id=" a speech so cutting, that Horrocks ever after&#10;trembled before him; the whole household bowed to him: Lady Crawley's&#10;curl-papers came off earlier when he was at home: Sir Pitt's muddy&#10;gaiters disappeared; and if that incorrigible old man still adhered to&#10;other old habits, he never fuddled himself with rum-and-water in his&#10;son's presence, and only talked to his servants in a very reserved and&#10;polite manner; and those persons remarked that Sir Pitt never swore at&#10;Lady Crawley while his son was in the room.&#10;&#10;It was he who taught the butler to say, &quot;My lady is served,&quot; and who&#10;insisted on handing her ladyship in to dinner.  He seldom spoke to her,&#10;but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let&#10;her quit the apartment without rising in the most stately manner to&#10;open the door, and making an elegant bow at her egress.&#10;&#10;At Eton he was called Miss Crawley; and there, I am sorry to say, his&#10;younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently.  But though his&#10;parts were not brilliant" />
    <node id=" was Mr. Crawley's meaning?&#10;&#10;Old Miss Crawley was certainly one of the reprobate. She had a snug&#10;little house in Park Lane, and, as she ate and drank a great deal too&#10;much during the season in London, she went to Harrowgate or Cheltenham&#10;for the summer.  She was the most hospitable and jovial of old vestals,&#10;and had been a beauty in her day, she said. (All old women were&#10;beauties once, we very well know.) She was a bel esprit, and a dreadful&#10;Radical for those days.  She had been in France (where St. Just, they&#10;say, inspired her with an unfortunate passion), and loved, ever after,&#10;French novels, French cookery, and French wines.  She read Voltaire,&#10;and had Rousseau by heart; talked very lightly about divorce, and most&#10;energetically of the rights of women.  She had pictures of Mr. Fox in&#10;every room in the house: when that statesman was in opposition, I am&#10;not sure that she had not flung a main with him; and when he came into&#10;office, she took great credit for bringing over" />
    <node id=" little&#10;wholesome society and instruction in his lodge, which was the only&#10;education bestowed upon them until Miss Sharp came.&#10;&#10;Her engagement was owing to the remonstrances of Mr. Pitt Crawley, the&#10;only friend or protector Lady Crawley ever had, and the only person,&#10;besides her children, for whom she entertained a little feeble&#10;attachment.  Mr. Pitt took after the noble Binkies, from whom he was&#10;descended, and was a very polite and proper gentleman.  When he grew to&#10;man's estate, and came back from Christchurch, he began to reform the&#10;slackened discipline of the hall, in spite of his father, who stood in&#10;awe of him.  He was a man of such rigid refinement, that he would have&#10;starved rather than have dined without a white neckcloth.  Once, when&#10;just from college, and when Horrocks the butler brought him a letter&#10;without placing it previously on a tray, he gave that domestic a look,&#10;and administered to him a speech so cutting, that Horrocks ever after&#10;trembled before him; the whole household bowed to him: Lady Crawley's&#10;curl" />
    <node id="Based on Mrs. Bute Crawley's inquiries and the connections between the servants and domestics at the Hall and Rectory, we can tell that Rebecca, the new governess at Queen's Crawley, has a distinguished lineage through her mother's side, who was a Montmorency. Mrs. Bute Crawley made every inquiry about Rebecca's history and character, as she knew details about the running of the Hall and had ties of relationship with the domestics at both the Hall and Rectory.&#10;&#10;Rebecca is well-liked by most people at the Hall, having &quot;come round&quot; everyone and managing the household affairs competently. She writes Sir Pitt's letters, handles his business, and has even gained control over the whole household, which has caused some suspicion among Mrs. Crawley, who thinks Rebecca has &quot;dreadful designs in view.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley initially takes a liking to Rebecca and invites her and her pupils to visit the Rectory. This is likely an attempt to secure a piano professor for her children, given that Signor Clementi did not teach them for nothing. Over time, Rawdon Crawley, Mrs. Bute's nephew and Rebecca's love interest, becomes very fond of her company as well, giving up his other activities to spend more time with her.&#10;&#10;The servants at the Hall and Rectory are well-acquainted, exchanging information about their masters and mistresses. This network allows Mrs. Bute Crawley to keep a close eye on Rebecca's interactions with the family and report back to Miss Pinkerton." />
    <node id=" as Rebecca&#10;at Queen's Crawley, and her gradual establishment in the good graces of&#10;all people there, could be unremarked by Mrs. Bute Crawley.  Mrs. Bute,&#10;who knew how many days the sirloin of beef lasted at the Hall; how much&#10;linen was got ready at the great wash; how many peaches were on the&#10;south wall; how many doses her ladyship took when she was ill--for such&#10;points are matters of intense interest to certain persons in the&#10;country--Mrs. Bute, I say, could not pass over the Hall governess&#10;without making every inquiry respecting her history and character.&#10;There was always the best understanding between the servants at the&#10;Rectory and the Hall. There was always a good glass of ale in the&#10;kitchen of the former place for the Hall people, whose ordinary drink&#10;was very small--and, indeed, the Rector's lady knew exactly how much&#10;malt went to every barrel of Hall beer--ties of relationship existed&#10;between the Hall and Rectory domestics, as between their masters; and&#10;through these channels each family was perfectly well acquainted with&#10;the doings of the other.  That," />

Thus the doings at the&#10;Hall were the great food for conversation at the Rectory, and Mrs.&#10;Bute's bright eyes spied out everything that took place in the enemy's&#10;camp--everything and a great deal besides.&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley to Miss Pinkerton, The Mall, Chiswick.&#10;&#10;Rectory, Queen's Crawley, December--.&#10;&#10;My Dear Madam,--Although it is so many years since I profited by your&#10;delightful and invaluable instructions, yet I have ever retained the&#10;FONDEST" />

Such a thing&#10;was never heard of before; the proud Mrs. Bute Crawley, first cousin to&#10;the Earl of Tiptoff, who won't condescend to visit Lady Crawley, except&#10;when her sister is in the country.  Poor Lady Crawley! during most part&#10;of these gaieties, she is upstairs taking pills.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute has all of a sudden taken a great fancy to me.  &quot;My dear Miss&#10;Sharp,&quot; she says, &quot;why not bring over your girls to the Rectory?--their&#10;cousins will be so happy to see them.&quot; I know what she means.

Don't you know he has hit a man, and shot an&#10;injured father through the hat only? He's adored in his regiment; and&#10;all the young men at Wattier's and the Cocoa-Tree swear by him.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Miss Rebecca Sharp wrote to her beloved friend the account of the&#10;little ball at Queen's Crawley, and the manner in which, for the first&#10;time, Captain Crawley had distinguished her, she did not, strange to&#10;relate, give an altogether accurate account of the transaction.  The&#10;Captain had distinguished her a great number of times before.  The&#10;Captain had met her in a half-score of walks. The Captain had lighted&#10;upon her in a half-hundred of corridors and passages.  The Captain had&#10;hung over her piano twenty times of an evening (my Lady was now&#10;upstairs, being ill, and nobody heeded her)" />
    <node id="The governess for Mr. Crawley's brother's daughters is Rebecca Sharp. According to Mrs. Bute Crawley, she was educated at Miss Pinkerton's school in Chiswick, the same establishment where Martha Crawley herself studied.

She is well-liked by most people at the Hall, having managed the household affairs competently and even gaining control over the whole household.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley has made inquiries about Rebecca's history and character, as she knew details about the running of the Hall and had ties of relationship with the domestics at both the Hall and Rectory.

However, over time, she becomes suspicious of Rebecca's intentions, thinking that Rebecca has &quot;dreadful designs in view.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rebecca is also described as having several stories about her ancestors and taking an interest in dictionaries, which strengthened Mr. Crawley's belief in her high-breeding and truthfulness. The narrator implies that Mr. Crawley might have developed some friendly interest in Rebecca due to these interactions, but it is clarified that he was attached to Lady Jane Sheepshanks at the time." />

'Tis most gratifying to one&#10;in my most arduous position to find that my maternal cares have&#10;elicited a responsive affection; and to recognize in the amiable Mrs.&#10;Bute Crawley my excellent pupil of former years, the sprightly and&#10;accomplished Miss Martha MacTavish.  I am happy to have under my charge&#10;now the daughters of many of those who were your contemporaries at my&#10;establishment--what pleasure it would give me if your own beloved young&#10;ladies had need of my instructive superintendence!&#10;&#10;Presenting my respectful compliments to Lady Fuddleston, I have the&#10;honour (epistolarily) to introduce to her ladyship my two friends" />

I hope your health is GOOD.  The world and the cause of&#10;education cannot afford to lose Miss Pinkerton for MANY MANY YEARS.&#10;When my friend, Lady Fuddleston, mentioned that her dear girls required&#10;an instructress (I am too poor to engage a governess for mine, but was&#10;I not educated at Chiswick?)--&quot;Who,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;can we consult but&#10;the excellent, the incomparable Miss Pinkerton?&quot; In a word, have you,&#10;dear madam, any ladies on your list, whose services might be made&#10;available to my kind friend and neighbour? I assure you she will take&#10;no governess BUT OF YOUR CHOOSING.&#10;&#10;My dear husband is pleased to say that he likes EVERYTHING WHICH COMES&#10;FROM MISS PINKERTON'S SCHOOL.

    <node id="The Crawley family in Shropshire consists of two brothers, the Baronet Sir Pitt Crawley and the Reverend Mr. Crawley, who are both very different from each other. The Baronet is a country gentleman who enjoys horse-racing and hunting, while the Reverend is a clergyman with strict moral values. Miss Crawley, their sister, dislikes the Reverend's pious behavior and prefers to stay with her brother Sir Pitt when she visits Shropshire.&#10;&#10;The Captain Crawley, who is Sir Pitt's son, is described as a tall, handsome young man who speaks loudly, swears frequently, and is very generous with his money. He has a hearty contempt for his father and calls him derogatory names such as &quot;old PUT,&quot; &quot;old SNOB,&quot; and &quot;old CHAW-BACON.&quot; The Captain also has a reputation among the ladies and brings his hunters home with him, living with the Squires of the county and asking whomever he pleases to dinner.&#10;&#10;Despite their differences, both Shropshire Crawleys become quite loving at Christmas when Miss Crawley arrives, as they do not want to offend her and risk losing her seventy thousand pounds when she dies. The narrator suggests that if the Shropshire Crawleys were clever people, they might inherit all of Miss Crawley's fortune, but their lack of intelligence makes this unlikely." />

He would have prayers in the house, I believe.&#10;&#10;Our sermon books are shut up when Miss Crawley arrives, and Mr. Pitt,&#10;whom she abominates, finds it convenient to go to town.

    <node id="Miss Sharp, also known as Jane Sheepshanks, made herself useful to her employer, Sir Pitt Crawley, in several ways. Firstly, she read law papers with patience and offered to copy his letters, modifying their spelling to suit contemporary usage. Secondly, she entertained him by playing backgammon, which she justified by saying that her mother used to play similar games with noblemen during her time. Furthermore, she shared stories about her ancestors and researched them in D'Hozier's dictionary to strengthen her claims of high-breeding. Lastly, she organized educational activities for the girls, such as reading sermons aloud.&#10;&#10;To defend playing backgammon with Sir Pitt, Miss Sharp argued that her mother, who was from a distinguished family, used to play similar games with noblemen. She found an excuse for this and other worldly amusements, claiming they were acceptable because of her high-born background." />
    <node id=" Jane Sheepshanks?&#10;&#10;He took Rebecca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at&#10;backgammon with Sir Pitt, saying that it was a godless amusement, and&#10;that she would be much better engaged in reading &quot;Thrump's Legacy,&quot; or&#10;&quot;The Blind Washerwoman of Moorfields,&quot; or any work of a more serious&#10;nature; but Miss Sharp said her dear mother used often to play the same&#10;game with the old Count de Trictrac and the venerable Abbe du Cornet,&#10;and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusements.&#10;&#10;But it was not only by playing at backgammon with the Baronet, that the&#10;little governess rendered herself agreeable to her employer. She found&#10;many different ways of being useful to him.  She read over, with&#10;indefatigable patience, all those law papers, with which, before she&#10;came to Queen's Crawley, he had promised to entertain her.  She&#10;volunteered to copy many of his letters, and adroitly altered the&#10;spelling of them so as to suit the usages of the present day.

    <node id="Reverend Bute Crawley is a character from the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray. He is described as a tall, jolly, shovel-hatted man who is far more popular in his country county than his brother. Unlike his brother, who is a country gentleman who enjoys horse-racing and hunting, Reverend Crawley is a clergyman with strict moral values. Despite their differences, both brothers become quite loving at Christmas when Miss Crawley arrives, as they do not want to offend her and risk losing her seventy thousand pounds when she dies. Reverend Crawley is known for attending every local event and dinner, as he has a taste for boxing and athletic exercises which he carries into his private life. He is well-liked in the county and is known for riding to hounds in a pepper-and-salt frock and being one of the best fishermen in the county." />

At&#10;college he pulled stroke-oar in the Christchurch boat, and had thrashed&#10;all the best bruisers of the &quot;town.&quot; He carried his taste for boxing&#10;and athletic exercises into private life; there was not a fight within&#10;twenty miles at which he was not present, nor a race, nor a coursing&#10;match, nor a regatta, nor a ball, nor an election, nor a visitation&#10;dinner, nor indeed a good dinner in the whole county, but he found&#10;means to attend it.

He had a&#10;fine voice; sang &quot;A southerly wind and a cloudy sky&quot;; and gave the&#10;&quot;whoop&quot; in chorus with general applause.  He rode to hounds in a&#10;pepper-and-salt frock, and was one of the best fishermen in the county.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Crawley, the rector's wife, was a smart little body, who wrote&#10;this worthy divine's sermons.  Being of a domestic turn, and keeping&#10;the house a great deal with her daughters, she ruled absolutely within&#10;the Rectory, wisely giving her husband full liberty without.

    <node id="Rebecca Sharp's success in initiating a friendship between the two families can be attributed to her abilities in managing household affairs competently and gaining control over the whole household. She had also managed to endear herself to most people at the Hall, including Mrs. Bute Crawley initially. &#10;&#10;The &quot;jovial old mediatrix&quot; mentioned in the narrative is Miss Crawley, who played a crucial role in maintaining the peace between the two families after Rebecca facilitated their meeting. Miss Crawley was known for her love of gaiety and enjoyed seeing everyone around her happy. Once she became involved in keeping the peace, an agreement was reached that allowed frequent visits between the young people from both families, ensuring lasting friendship as long as Miss Crawley was there to maintain harmony." />
    <node id=" Farewell, dearest girl,&#10;&#10;Your affectionate Rebecca.&#10;&#10;P.S.--I wish you could have seen the faces of the Miss Blackbrooks&#10;(Admiral Blackbrook's daughters, my dear), fine young ladies, with&#10;dresses from London, when Captain Rawdon selected poor me for a partner!&#10;&#10;&#10;When Mrs. Bute Crawley (whose artifices our ingenious Rebecca had so&#10;soon discovered) had procured from Miss Sharp the promise of a visit,&#10;she induced the all-powerful Miss Crawley to make the necessary&#10;application to Sir Pitt, and the good-natured old lady, who loved to be&#10;gay herself, and to see every one gay and happy round about her, was&#10;quite charmed, and ready to establish a reconciliation and intimacy&#10;between her two brothers. It was therefore agreed that the young people&#10;of both families should visit each other frequently for the future, and&#10;the friendship of course lasted as long as the jovial old mediatrix was&#10;there to keep the peace.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did you ask that scoundrel, Rawdon Crawley, to dine?&quot; said the&#10;Rector to his lady, as they were walking home through the" />
    <node id=" Rebecca; not without a tingling&#10;consciousness of defeat, as she thought over her little misadventure&#10;with Jos Sedley.&#10;&#10;So she wisely determined to render her position with the Queen's&#10;Crawley family comfortable and secure, and to this end resolved to make&#10;friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her&#10;comfort.&#10;&#10;As my Lady Crawley was not one of these personages, and a woman,&#10;moreover, so indolent and void of character as not to be of the least&#10;consequence in her own house, Rebecca soon found that it was not at all&#10;necessary to cultivate her good will--indeed, impossible to gain it.&#10;She used to talk to her pupils about their &quot;poor mamma&quot;; and, though&#10;she treated that lady with every demonstration of cool respect, it was&#10;to the rest of the family that she wisely directed the chief part of&#10;her attentions.&#10;&#10;With the young people, whose applause she thoroughly gained, her method&#10;was pretty simple.

    <node id="Based on Mrs. Bute Crawley's inquiries and observations about Rebecca Sharp, the new governess at Queen's Crawley, we can infer that Rebecca has made a positive impression on most people at the Hall due to her competent management of household affairs and her ability to gain control over the entire household. She writes Sir Pitt's letters, handles his business, and has become well-liked by many, which has caused some suspicion among Mrs. Crawley, who believes Rebecca has &quot;dreadful designs in view.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley initially takes a liking to Rebecca and invites her and her pupils to visit the Rectory, possibly as an attempt to secure a piano professor for her children. Over time, Rawdon Crawley, Mrs. Bute's nephew and Rebecca's love interest, becomes very fond of her company as well.&#10;&#10;The servants at the Hall and Rectory are well-acquainted, exchanging information about their masters and mistresses. This network allows Mrs. Bute Crawley to keep a close eye on Rebecca's interactions with the family and report back to Miss Pinkerton.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca Sharp has successfully integrated herself into life at the Hall, becoming an influential figure in its day-to-day operations and garnering positive attention from many, including Mrs. Bute Crawley initially. However, her rising influence and secretive behavior have raised suspicions among some family members, leading to concerns about her true intentions." />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that during Miss MacWhirter's visits, there are several positive changes observed in the household. These changes include:&#10;&#10;1. Improved meals: With Miss MacWhirter's arrival, the family enjoys game every day, Malmsey-Madeira, and abundant fish from London, indicating a significant upgrade in meal quality and variety.&#10;2. Festive atmosphere: The house assumes a festive appearance during her stay, implying that there is more joy and warmth within the household.&#10;3. Better sleep for the master: The homeowner, who usually goes to bed after dinner, finds himself engaged in card games (though he always loses), indicating his enjoyment of Miss MacWhirter's company and prolonged waking hours during her visit.&#10;4. Content employees: Even the servants in the kitchen share in the general prosperity, suggesting that they too benefit from Miss MacWhirter's presence through better meals or working conditions.&#10;5. Stronger beer and increased consumption of luxury items: The beer is grown much stronger, and there is a noticeable increase in tea and sugar consumption in the nursery, which is likely due to Miss MacWhirter's maid taking her meals there. This implies that resources are being directed towards providing better food and drink for both the family members and their staff during her visits.&#10;&#10;These improvements suggest that Miss MacWhirter's presence has a significant positive impact on the overall mood, atmosphere, and well-being of the household, making it more pleasant and prosperous during her stay." />

This activity was overseen by Mr. Crawley, who wanted to evaluate their reading skills and ensure that Miss Sharp, the new governess, had an opportunity to hear them read. After they finished reading, the household, including Sir Pitt, were called to prayers at ten o'clock in the evening. The purpose of these activities was to engage the girls in a more educational and improving pastime, focused on religious teachings and self-improvement." />

However, Rawdon has grown fond of Rebecca Sharp, the new governess at Queen's Crawley, and starts spending more time with her, neglecting his duties as a country gentleman and causing Flether to become resentful.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, on the other hand, handles the situation deftly by taking over some of Flether's responsibilities such as managing Rawdon's wardrobe and ensuring he is well-presented during social events. Although this arrangement might not be ideal for Flether, Rebecca's intervention helps maintain a sense of order and calm in the household.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that neither Sir Pitt nor Mr. Horrocks approve of Rawdon's behavior or Rebecca's involvement in managing his affairs. However, their disapproval does not seem to deter either party from continuing this arrangement, highlighting Rebecca's influence and growing importance within the Crawley household.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rawdon Crawley has a servant named Flether who feels neglected due to Rebecca Sharp's increasing presence in his life. While Sir Pitt and Mr. Horrocks disapprove of this situation, Rebecca steps in to help manage Rawdon's affairs, solidifying her role within the household despite some resistance." />

Sharp practices as a landlord and farmer: His strictness with tenants and stinginess with resources led to bankrupt tenants and poor crop yields due to Nature's revenge.&#10;&#10;4.

    <node id="Old Miss Crawley, as described in the narrative, is depicted as a reprobate yet hospitable and jovial woman with a love for French culture. She holds radical political views for her time, showing enthusiasm for topics such as divorce and the rights of women. She had spent time in France and developed a fondness for French novels, cookery, and wines. This fondness is reflected in her home, where she has pictures of Mr. Fox in every room. Miss Crawley is well-read, particularly in the works of Voltaire and Rousseau.&#10;&#10;In terms of habits, Old Miss Crawley enjoys eating and drinking to excess during the season in London, which leads her to spend summers at places like Harrowgate or Cheltenham for health reasons. Despite her age, she still thinks of herself as a beauty from her youthful days.&#10;&#10;Her admiration for French culture is evident not only in her love for French literature and wines but also in the way she appreciates and values Mr. Crawley's proficiency in speaking the French language. She even encourages him to use it more often, as seen when Rebecca Sharp compliments his skills in the language.&#10;&#10;In summary, Old Miss Crawley is portrayed as a radical thinker with a deep appreciation for French culture and literature. Her habits include indulging in food and drink during her time in London, while summers are spent at spas to restore her health. Despite being an older woman, she still cherishes the memories of her beauty in her younger days." />

She admired, beyond measure,&#10;his speech at the Quashimaboo-Aid Society; took an interest in his&#10;pamphlet on malt: was often affected, even to tears, by his discourses&#10;of an evening, and would say--&quot;Oh, thank you, sir,&quot; with a sigh, and a&#10;look up to heaven, that made him occasionally condescend to shake hands&#10;with her.  &quot;Blood is everything, after all,&quot; would that aristocratic&#10;religionist say. &quot;How Miss Sharp is awakened by my words, when not one&#10;of the people here is touched.

On&#10;another occasion he was rather scandalised at finding his sister with a&#10;book of French plays; but as the governess remarked that it was for the&#10;purpose of acquiring the French idiom in conversation, he was fain to&#10;be content.

    <node id="The passage describes significant changes in Queen's Crawley under Sir Pitt Crawley's leadership. Once known for its extravagant hospitality, with cellars filled with burgundy, kennels with hounds, and stables with gallant hunters, the household has now reduced its expenses due to Sir Pitt's parsimonious nature. The horses that were once used for hunting are now utilized for labor or transportation, and the number of footmen has been reduced to three.&#10;&#10;Despite these changes, Sir Pitt Crawley still values his dignity while at home and often insists on using four horses when he drives out. He maintains a certain level of formality in his household, with the butler, Horrocks, becoming more attentive and respectful in his presence. The arrival of Mr. Crawley, Sir Pitt's son, has brought about further changes, with the household showing even more restraint in their behavior and language, especially in front of Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;The character of Sir Pitt Crawley can be described as a pragmatic and frugal individual who values his dignity and respectability. Although he is known for his parsimony, he still maintains a level of extravagance to uphold his status in society. He may have realized that excessive spending was not sustainable and decided to reduce costs without sacrificing too much comfort or dignity. However, his attempts to maintain a certain level of prestige are evident in his insistence on using four horses and maintaining three footmen for serving purposes. Overall, Sir Pitt Crawley's character is shaped by his desire to balance frugality with social respectability." />

He made an effort to win over the domestic staff, who in turn adored him for his generous nature. Although no explicit mention is made of his behavior towards Miss Crawley herself, it can be inferred that he treated her well, as the narrator mentions how good it was of Mrs. Bute Crawley not to be jealous of Rebecca Sharp's presence, given Rawdon Crawley's partiality for the new governess and his status as Miss Crawley's nephew through marriage." />

Creating relatable and engaging characters: The preacher at Naples created fictitious yet believable villains that resonated with his audience, evoking strong emotional responses and encouraging them to participate in the storytelling process.&#10;&#10;2. Using vivid language and descriptions: Storytellers can use strong, descriptive language to bring their stories to life, making the narrative more immersive and engaging for the audience. This is demonstrated by the actors in Paris theatres who refuse to play wicked parts unless they can do so in a realistic manner, using suitable abuse and bad language to convey the characters' villainy effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Encouraging audience interaction: By allowing or encouraging the audience to express their emotions and reactions during the storytelling process, storytellers can create a more engaging atmosphere that fosters stronger emotional connections between the audience and the narrative. This is evident in both the Naples preacher's story, where the audience couldn't resist joining in on the poet's cursing of the fictional villain, and the Paris theatre performances, where audience members openly yell out their frustrations at the tyrants of the plays.&#10;&#10;4. Demonstrating sincerity and passion: A storyteller who is genuinely invested in their narrative and its characters can more effectively evoke emotional responses from their audience. The Naples preacher's rage and passion when describing villainous characters, as well as the Parisian actors' refusal to play wicked parts unless they can do so sincerely, highlight the importance of genuine emotion in storytelling.&#10;&#10;5. Building tension and anticipation: By hinting at complex and harrowing plot developments, storytellers can pique their audience's curiosity and keep them engaged throughout the narrative. The narrator in this passage does this by promising a story involving intricate criminal activities and significant wrongdoings, ensuring that the audience will be eager to follow the story as it unfolds." />

    <node id="Mrs. Crawley, the wife of Reverend Bute Crawley, plays a supportive role in her husband's social activities in the county. Despite his busy schedule as a clergyman and his involvement in various local events and dinners, Mrs. Crawley manages the household efficiently and allows him the freedom to engage in these activities. She is described as a &quot;smart little body&quot; who writes her husband's sermons and handles domestic matters wisely.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Crawley's contributions enable the Reverend Crawley to attend various social events, such as dinner parties and fox hunts, where he is well-liked and respected. He is known for riding to hounds in a pepper-and-salt frock and being one of the best fishermen in the county. His wife's management of the household finances also allows him to maintain a respectable appearance while socializing with the county's elite, as she is aware of the price of port wine and other expenses.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Crawley plays a crucial role in facilitating her husband's active social life in the county. Her support enables him to participate in various local events and maintain a positive reputation, despite his demanding schedule as a clergyman." />
    <node id="The narrative provided does not explicitly mention that Mrs. Crawley invites a known criminal and murderer into her home.

Therefore, I cannot accurately answer this question without referring to the proper source material, specifically the part where such an event is described." />
    <node id="When Miss Crawley, the wealthy sister of the Shropshire Crawley brothers (Sir Pitt Crawley and the unnamed Reverend Mr. Crawley), visits them, significant changes in their behavior are observed. Both brothers become much more amicable and avoid any sort of quarreling or conflict during her stay. Sir Pitt even leaves for town to avoid offending his sister, while Captain Crawley endears himself to the servants with his generosity and commanding presence.&#10;&#10;The Reverend Mr. Crawley also becomes more cordial, as he was previously offended by Miss Crawley's liberal lifestyle. However, he remains uneasy due to their differing moral values.&#10;&#10;The potential consequences of their actions towards Miss Crawley's money are that if they were cleverer, the Shropshire Crawleys could potentially inherit all of her fortune, given she has threatened to leave it to whomever offends her. The narrator implies that neither brother is intelligent enough to manipulate or charm Miss Crawley sufficiently for this outcome.&#10;&#10;Overall, the Shropshire Crawley brothers alter their behavior significantly during Miss Crawley's visits in an attempt to maintain a pleasant environment and ensure they remain in her favor, thus potentially securing a share of her substantial wealth upon her death." />
    <node id="The speaker was forced to go outside the coach and travel in the rain during a heavy downpour because Sir Pitt, who is a proprietor of the coach, wanted to give an inside place to a passenger who came at Mudbury. This action reveals that Sir Pitt is a stingy and avaricious person, as he was more concerned with making a profit by not hiring another driver than with the comfort and well-being of his passengers. The young gentleman from Cambridge College even referred to him as an &quot;old screw&quot; because of his meanness. This character trait is further highlighted when Sir Pitt chooses to drive the coach himself on the last two stages, which results in a slower pace but allows him to save money." />
    <node id="The Rector of Queen's Crawley, named Mr. Crawley, faced constant financial struggles primarily due to two main reasons. First, he had substantial college bills that his family incurred during his father's lifetime, which took him over a decade to pay off. Secondly, when he was finally debt-free, he made a risky bet of 100 to 1 against Kangaroo in the Derby, losing the wager and having to take up the money at a ruinous interest rate. These two significant financial setbacks put him in a constant state of debt, despite his wife's efforts to be prudent and thrifty." />

Ever since Mrs. Bute carried off the young Rector of&#10;Queen's Crawley (she was of a good family, daughter of the late&#10;Lieut.-Colonel Hector McTavish, and she and her mother played for Bute&#10;and won him at Harrowgate), she had been a prudent and thrifty wife to&#10;him.  In spite of her care, however, he was always in debt.  It took&#10;him at least ten years to pay off his college bills contracted during&#10;his father's lifetime. In the year 179-, when he was just clear of&#10;these incumbrances, he gave the odds of 100 to 1 (in twenties) against&#10;Kangaroo, who won the Derby.  The Rector was obliged to take up the&#10;money at a ruinous interest, and had been struggling ever since.  His&#10;sister helped him with a hundred now and then, but of course his great&#10;hope was in her death--when &quot;hang it&quot; (as he would say), &quot;Matilda must&#10;leave me half her money" />

Rebecca writes Sir Pitt's letters, handles his business, and has even gained the fondness of Rawdon Crawley, Mrs. Bute's nephew.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley initially took a liking to Rebecca and invited her to visit the Rectory; however, she later became suspicious of Rebecca's intentions and thought that she had &quot;dreadful designs in view.&quot; The servants at the Hall and Rectory are well-acquainted, exchanging information about their masters and mistresses, which allows Mrs. Bute Crawley to keep a close eye on Rebecca's interactions with the family and report back to Miss Pinkerton.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca has successfully integrated herself into life at the Hall, becoming an influential figure in its day-to-day operations and garnering positive attention from many, including Mrs. Bute Crawley initially. However, her rising influence and secretive behavior have raised suspicions among some family members, leading to concerns about her true intentions.">

Once known for its extravagant hospitality, with cellars filled with burgundy, kennels with hounds, and stables with gallant hunters, the household has now reduced its expenses due to Sir Pitt's parsimonious nature. The horses that were once used for hunting are now utilized for labor or transportation, and the number of footmen has been reduced to three.&#10;&#10;Despite these changes, Sir Pitt Crawley still values his dignity while at home and often insists on using four horses when he drives out. He maintains a certain level of formality in his household, with the butler, Horrocks, becoming more attentive and respectful in his presence. The arrival of Mr. Crawley, Sir Pitt's son, has brought about further changes, with the household showing even more restraint in their behavior and language, especially in front of Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;The character of Sir Pitt Crawley can be described as a pragmatic and frugal individual who values his dignity and respectability. Although he is known for his parsimony, he still maintains a level of extravagance to uphold his status in society. He may have realized that excessive spending was not sustainable and decided to reduce costs without sacrificing too much comfort or dignity. However, his attempts to maintain a certain level of prestige are evident in his insistence on using four horses and maintaining three footmen for serving purposes. Overall, Sir Pitt Crawley's character is shaped by his desire to balance frugality with social respectability.">

Once, when Mr.&#10;Crawley asked what the young people were reading," target="Old Miss Crawley, as described in the narrative, is depicted as a reprobate yet hospitable and jovial woman with a love for French culture. She holds radical political views for her time, showing enthusiasm for topics such as divorce and the rights of women. She had spent time in France and developed a fondness for French novels, cookery, and wines. This fondness is reflected in her home, where she has pictures of Mr. Fox in every room. Miss Crawley is well-read, particularly in the works of Voltaire and Rousseau.&#10;&#10;In terms of habits, Old Miss Crawley enjoys eating and drinking to excess during the season in London, which leads her to spend summers at places like Harrowgate or Cheltenham for health reasons. Despite her age, she still thinks of herself as a beauty from her youthful days.&#10;&#10;Her admiration for French culture is evident not only in her love for French literature and wines but also in the way she appreciates and values Mr. Crawley's proficiency in speaking the French language. She even encourages him to use it more often, as seen when Rebecca Sharp compliments his skills in the language.&#10;&#10;In summary, Old Miss Crawley is portrayed as a radical thinker with a deep appreciation for French culture and literature. Her habits include indulging in food and drink during her time in London, while summers are spent at spas to restore her health. Despite being an older woman, she still cherishes the memories of her beauty in her younger days.">

However, his attempts to maintain a certain level of prestige are evident in his insistence on using four horses and maintaining three footmen for serving purposes.

He is described as a tall, jolly, shovel-hatted man who is far more popular in his country county than his brother. Unlike his brother, who is a country gentleman who enjoys horse-racing and hunting, Reverend Crawley is a clergyman with strict moral values. Despite their differences, both brothers become quite loving at Christmas when Miss Crawley arrives, as they do not want to offend her and risk losing her seventy thousand pounds when she dies. Reverend Crawley is known for attending every local event and dinner, as he has a taste for boxing and athletic exercises which he carries into his private life. He is well-liked in the county and is known for riding to hounds in a pepper-and-salt frock and being one of the best fishermen in the county.">

However, Rawdon has grown fond of Rebecca Sharp, the new governess at Queen's Crawley, and starts spending more time with her, neglecting his duties as a country gentleman and causing Flether to become resentful.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, on the other hand, handles the situation deftly by taking over some of Flether's responsibilities such as managing Rawdon's wardrobe and ensuring he is well-presented during social events.

However, their disapproval does not seem to deter either party from continuing this arrangement, highlighting Rebecca's influence and growing importance within the Crawley household.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rawdon Crawley has a servant named Flether who feels neglected due to Rebecca Sharp's increasing presence in his life. While Sir Pitt and Mr. Horrocks disapprove of this situation, Rebecca steps in to help manage Rawdon's affairs, solidifying her role within the household despite some resistance.">

Once known for its extravagant hospitality, with cellars filled with burgundy, kennels with hounds, and stables with gallant hunters, the household has now reduced its expenses due to Sir Pitt's parsimonious nature. The horses that were once used for hunting are now utilized for labor or transportation, and the number of footmen has been reduced to three.&#10;&#10;Despite these changes, Sir Pitt Crawley still values his dignity while at home and often insists on using four horses when he drives out. He maintains a certain level of formality in his household, with the butler, Horrocks, becoming more attentive and respectful in his presence. The arrival of Mr. Crawley, Sir Pitt's son, has brought about further changes, with the household showing even more restraint in their behavior and language, especially in front of Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;The character of Sir Pitt Crawley can be described as a pragmatic and frugal individual who values his dignity and respectability. Although he is known for his parsimony, he still maintains a level of extravagance to uphold his status in society. He may have realized that excessive spending was not sustainable and decided to reduce costs without sacrificing too much comfort or dignity. However, his attempts to maintain a certain level of prestige are evident in his insistence on using four horses and maintaining three footmen for serving purposes. Overall, Sir Pitt Crawley's character is shaped by his desire to balance frugality with social respectability.">

However, Rawdon has grown fond of Rebecca Sharp, the new governess at Queen's Crawley, and starts spending more time with her, neglecting his duties as a country gentleman and causing Flether to become resentful.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, on the other hand, handles the situation deftly by taking over some of Flether's responsibilities such as managing Rawdon's wardrobe and ensuring he is well-presented during social events. Although this arrangement might not be ideal for Flether, Rebecca's intervention helps maintain a sense of order and calm in the household.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that neither Sir Pitt nor Mr. Horrocks approve of Rawdon's behavior or Rebecca's involvement in managing his affairs.

Once known for its extravagant hospitality, with cellars filled with burgundy, kennels with hounds, and stables with gallant hunters, the household has now reduced its expenses due to Sir Pitt's parsimonious nature. The horses that were once used for hunting are now utilized for labor or transportation, and the number of footmen has been reduced to three.&#10;&#10;Despite these changes, Sir Pitt Crawley still values his dignity while at home and often insists on using four horses when he drives out. He maintains a certain level of formality in his household, with the butler, Horrocks, becoming more attentive and respectful in his presence. The arrival of Mr. Crawley, Sir Pitt's son, has brought about further changes, with the household showing even more restraint in their behavior and language, especially in front of Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;The character of Sir Pitt Crawley can be described as a pragmatic and frugal individual who values his dignity and respectability. Although he is known for his parsimony, he still maintains a level of extravagance to uphold his status in society. He may have realized that excessive spending was not sustainable and decided to reduce costs without sacrificing too much comfort or dignity. However, his attempts to maintain a certain level of prestige are evident in his insistence on using four horses and maintaining three footmen for serving purposes. Overall, Sir Pitt Crawley's character is shaped by his desire to balance frugality with social respectability.">

Creating relatable and engaging characters: The preacher at Naples created fictitious yet believable villains that resonated with his audience, evoking strong emotional responses and encouraging them to participate in the storytelling process.&#10;&#10;2. Using vivid language and descriptions: Storytellers can use strong, descriptive language to bring their stories to life, making the narrative more immersive and engaging for the audience. This is demonstrated by the actors in Paris theatres who refuse to play wicked parts unless they can do so in a realistic manner, using suitable abuse and bad language to convey the characters' villainy effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Encouraging audience interaction: By allowing or encouraging the audience to express their emotions and reactions during the storytelling process, storytellers can create a more engaging atmosphere that fosters stronger emotional connections between the audience and the narrative.

    <edge source="The passage describes significant changes in Queen's Crawley under Sir Pitt Crawley's leadership. Once known for its extravagant hospitality, with cellars filled with burgundy, kennels with hounds, and stables with gallant hunters, the household has now reduced its expenses due to Sir Pitt's parsimonious nature. The horses that were once used for hunting are now utilized for labor or transportation, and the number of footmen has been reduced to three.&#10;&#10;Despite these changes, Sir Pitt Crawley still values his dignity while at home and often insists on using four horses when he drives out. He maintains a certain level of formality in his household, with the butler, Horrocks, becoming more attentive and respectful in his presence. The arrival of Mr. Crawley, Sir Pitt's son, has brought about further changes, with the household showing even more restraint in their behavior and language, especially in front of Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;The character of Sir Pitt Crawley can be described as a pragmatic and frugal individual who values his dignity and respectability. Although he is known for his parsimony, he still maintains a level of extravagance to uphold his status in society. He may have realized that excessive spending was not sustainable and decided to reduce costs without sacrificing too much comfort or dignity. However, his attempts to maintain a certain level of prestige are evident in his insistence on using four horses and maintaining three footmen for serving purposes. Overall, Sir Pitt Crawley's character is shaped by his desire to balance frugality with social respectability." target="avets.

This action reveals that Sir Pitt is a stingy and avaricious person, as he was more concerned with making a profit by not hiring another driver than with the comfort and well-being of his passengers. The young gentleman from Cambridge College even referred to him as an &quot;old screw&quot; because of his meanness. This character trait is further highlighted when Sir Pitt chooses to drive the coach himself on the last two stages, which results in a slower pace but allows him to save money.">

    <edge source="The arrival of Miss Crawley's nephew, Captain Crawley, led to some significant changes in her household.

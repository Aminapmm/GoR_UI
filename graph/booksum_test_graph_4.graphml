    <node id="1. Elinor had Marianne's letter read aloud by Mrs. Jennings to ensure that their hostess would understand the full situation regarding Lucy Steele, Edward, and Mrs. Ferrars. This allowed Mrs. Jennings to be fully informed of the circumstances so she could provide appropriate support and guidance for the Dashwood sisters.&#10;2. Marianne's reaction to being in town for over two months is one of increasing impatience and longing for the country. She sighs for &quot;the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country&quot; and is eager to leave London as soon as possible. This contrasts with Elinor, who shares similar anxieties about their situation but is more aware of the difficulties and logistics involved in making such a journey." />
    <node id=" the particulars, was so&#10;fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,&#10;though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor&#10;were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were&#10;again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather&#10;to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.&#10;&#10;An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they&#10;entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing&#10;with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was&#10;herself left to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,&#10;nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by&#10;any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.  But at last&#10;she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,&#10;though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting&#10;them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of&#10;Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's.&#10;Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying&#10;to do it away.&quot;&#10;&#10;The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame of&#10;mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her&#10;whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged&#10;never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of&#10;bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of&#10;dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring&#10;them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These&#10;were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured,&#10;no reparation could be too much for her to make.&#10;&#10;She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She&#10;attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an&#10;unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard&#10;three times to say, &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;--She listened to her praise of Lucy&#10;with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings&#10;talked of Edward's affection, it cost her" />
    <node id=" his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.&#10;&#10;It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley&#10;Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his&#10;wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel&#10;it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation, however,&#10;which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the&#10;assistance of any encouragement from her companions.  Marianne, not&#10;contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to&#10;prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her&#10;carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.&#10;John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after&#10;the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking&#10;Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company&#10;again.  The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a&#10;visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run&#10;the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom" />
    <node id=" as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to&#10;be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.&#10;Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and&#10;praise.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite&#10;proper to let him be off if he would.  That was just like Lucy.--Poor&#10;soul! I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart.--She calls me&#10;dear Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a good-hearted girl as ever&#10;lived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence is very prettily turned.&#10;Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough.  How attentive she is, to&#10;think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is as&#10;pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great&#10;credit.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,&#10;and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day.  She sighed&#10;for the air, the liberty, the quiet" />
    <node id="ars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every&#10;conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has&#10;been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear&#10;it will be a bad one.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung&#10;for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a&#10;woman who could not reward him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;and how did it end?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is&#10;dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.  He left her house&#10;yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do&#10;not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to the&#10;prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation more&#10;deplorable.  The interest of two thousand pounds--" />
    <node id=" two months in town,&#10;and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day.  She sighed&#10;for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if&#10;any place could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly&#10;less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent&#10;on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the&#10;difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought&#10;to acknowledge.  She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts&#10;towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to&#10;their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her&#10;good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from&#10;home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more&#10;eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about&#10;the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both&#10;her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with&#10;them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy&#10;of Miss Dashwood;" />
    <node id="The speaker, Colonel Brandon, offers the living of Delaford to Mr. Ferrars as an act of kindness and support. Colonel Brandon wants to be of use to Mr. Ferrars, who is facing financial difficulties due to his mother's insistence that he marries a woman with a fortune. By offering the living, Colonel Brandon aims to help Mr. Ferrars by providing him with a source of income and a path towards gaining some financial independence from his mother.&#10;&#10;This offer could potentially impact Colonel Brandon's relationship with Edward (Mr. Ferrars) in a positive way, as it demonstrates the Colonel's genuine concern for Edward's well-being and his desire to support him during a challenging time. The offer shows that Colonel Brandon is a true friend who is willing to go out of his way to help Edward, even if it means giving up something valuable like the living of Delaford. This generous gesture can strengthen their friendship and create a deeper bond between them, as Edward will likely feel grateful for the Colonel's support and kindness." />
    <node id=" matter before&#10;this person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a&#10;man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident&#10;in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced&#10;that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human&#10;character.  I suppose, however--on recollection--that the case may&#10;probably be THIS.  Edward is only to hold the living till the person to&#10;whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to&#10;take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that&#10;she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel&#10;Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which&#10;it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is truly astonishing!&quot;--he cried, after hearing what she&#10;said--&quot;what could be the Colonel's motive?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a" />
    <node id=" told him that it was.&#10;&#10;&quot;The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,&quot;--he replied, with great&#10;feeling,--&quot;of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long&#10;attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what&#10;she may be doing--what she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr.&#10;Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with&#10;him.  He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted&#10;in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his&#10;own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understand&#10;that he intends to take orders.  Will you be so good as to tell him&#10;that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this&#10;day's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,&#10;perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be&#10;nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more  valuable.-- It&#10;is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Elinor made what excuse she could for her.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am not sorry to see you alone,&quot; he replied, &quot;for I have a good deal&#10;to say to you.  This living of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has&#10;he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was&#10;coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of&#10;Delaford to Edward.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no&#10;connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a&#10;price!--what was the value of this?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About two hundred a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of that&#10;value--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and&#10;likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen&#10;hundred pounds.  And how came he not to have settled that matter before&#10;this person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a&#10;man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder" />
    <node id="&quot;A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky&#10;man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I&#10;have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like&#10;to hear it much talked of.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she&#10;thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth&#10;to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly&#10;impoverished.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Ferrars,&quot; added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so&#10;important a subject, &quot;knows nothing about it at present, and I believe&#10;it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may&#10;be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be&#10;supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in&#10;knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be&#10;quite out of the question;" />
    <node id=" and fortunately she had heard&#10;his address from Miss Steele.  She could undertake therefore to inform&#10;him of it, in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,&#10;Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so&#10;respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he&#10;mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--an&#10;evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very&#10;light of, at least as far as regarded its size.&#10;&#10;&quot;The smallness of the house,&quot; said she, &quot;I cannot imagine any&#10;inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and&#10;income.&quot;&#10;&#10;By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr.&#10;Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for&#10;he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such&#10;an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle&#10;on--and he said so.&#10;&#10;&quot;This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable&#10;as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.  I am sorry to" />
    <node id=" must be concealed from her as much as&#10;possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory&#10;by THIS time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most&#10;affectionate mothers in the world.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor was silent.&#10;&#10;&quot;We think NOW,&quot;--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, &quot;of ROBERT'S&#10;marrying Miss Morton.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's&#10;tone, calmly replied,&#10;&#10;&quot;The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Choice!--how do you mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be&#10;the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all&#10;intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any&#10;thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that&#10;one is superior to the other.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="When Elinor relays the news of Edward's situation as a clergyman to Robert, he responds with amusement and laughter. He finds the idea of Edward living in a small parsonage and publishing banns of marriage ridiculous. This reaction annoys Elinor, but she remains silent and expressionless, causing Robert to recover from his foolishness and realize the inappropriateness of his behavior.&#10;&#10;Robert then expresses his surprise at Elinor's revelation, stating that their mother is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world and will never forget that Edward is her son. He also mentions Robert's plans to marry Miss Morton, which he views as the same as Edward marrying her since Robert will now be considered the eldest son due to his mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;Overall, Robert's response to the news of Edward's situation shows a lack of sensitivity and empathy towards his brother, further solidifying Elinor's negative opinion of him." />
    <node id=" subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as&#10;she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very&#10;different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed&#10;most immoderately.  The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living&#10;in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to&#10;that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a&#10;white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith&#10;and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.&#10;&#10;Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the&#10;conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed&#10;on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was a&#10;look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,&#10;and gave no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,&#10;not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.&#10;&#10;&quot;We may treat it as a joke,&quot; said he, at last, recovering from the&#10;affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out" />
    <node id=" sat down to reconsider the&#10;past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of&#10;Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.&#10;&#10;When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people&#10;whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a&#10;great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important&#10;secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to&#10;it again as soon as Elinor appeared.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; she cried, &quot;I sent you up the young man.  Did not I&#10;do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find&#10;him very unwilling to accept your proposal?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon&#10;that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Really,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;I know so little of these kind of forms, that I&#10;can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation&#10;necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his&#10;ordination.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Two" />
    <node id=" mind;--and she was&#10;therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply&#10;herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her&#10;brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.  After a few moments'&#10;chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her&#10;sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was&#10;left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay&#10;unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so&#10;unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the prejudice&#10;of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of&#10;life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her most&#10;unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.&#10;&#10;They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to&#10;speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very&#10;inquisitive on the subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as&#10;she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very&#10;different," />
    <node id=" of every one&#10;concerned in it.&#10;&#10;She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really&#10;was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being&#10;possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and&#10;Lucy.  What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a&#10;doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to&#10;know how Edward would conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much&#10;compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to&#10;procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.&#10;&#10;As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the&#10;necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion.  No time was to be&#10;lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,&#10;and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,&#10;without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any&#10;resentment against Edward.&#10;&#10;Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what she&#10;really believed" />
    <node id="1. Colonel Brandon states that he fears &quot;it cannot take place very soon&quot; because he has not yet arranged for the living (a clerical position) that he intends to give to Edward Ferrars. The living is currently tied to a presentation, which means it's owned by someone else and can only be transferred when the owner is ready to do so or meets certain conditions (such as reaching a certain age). This process might take a few months, hence his comment on the delay.&#10;2. Marianne Dashwood is not offended or mortified by this delay because she is unaware of the real reason behind Colonel Brandon's statement. She mistakenly assumes that the Colonel is delaying their marriage due to age, thinking he needs to wait until he is older. In reality, Marianne does not have any negative feelings towards Colonel Brandon, and her lack of offense or mortification highlights her trust in him and her genuine affection for him." />
    <node id="  He LOOKED all the astonishment&#10;which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of&#10;exciting; but he said only these two words,&#10;&#10;&quot;Colonel Brandon!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the&#10;worst was over, &quot;Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern&#10;for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which the&#10;unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I&#10;am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and&#10;likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and&#10;his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find&#10;friendship any where.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; replied he, with sudden consciousness, &quot;not to find it in YOU;&#10;for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it&#10;all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know,&#10;I am no" />
    <node id=" indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;&#10;but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in reply&#10;she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that&#10;she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings&#10;commended her in her heart for being so honest.  They then talked on&#10;for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another&#10;lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these words in the&#10;Colonel's calm voice,--&#10;&#10;&quot;I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost&#10;ready to cry out, &quot;Lord! what should hinder it?&quot;--but checking her&#10;desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.&quot;&#10;&#10;This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or&#10;mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the&#10;conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings&#10;very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which she" />
    <node id=" hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation&#10;necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his&#10;ordination.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Two or three months!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings; &quot;Lord! my dear, how calmly&#10;you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord&#10;bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though&#10;one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think&#10;it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.  Sure&#10;somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in&#10;orders already.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear ma'am,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;what can you be thinking of?-- Why,&#10;Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the&#10;Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.&#10;Ferrars!&quot;&#10;&#10;The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation&#10;immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for" />
    <node id=" John,&#10;&quot;than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might&#10;have been his own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.&quot;&#10;&#10;A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his&#10;visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really&#10;believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and&#10;that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;&#10;leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present&#10;occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the&#10;Dashwoods', and Edward's.&#10;&#10;Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and&#10;as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in&#10;Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the&#10;party.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only&#10;Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew how&#10;little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the&#10;consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Elinor estimates that two or three months will be necessary for Edward's ordination to be completed. She mentions that she is not well-versed in the procedures involved in ordination, but her estimate is based on her understanding of the process. As for Edward's readiness to accept a proposal from Elinor, there is no direct information provided about his feelings or intentions. However, it can be inferred that he is open to the idea since he does not express unwillingness when Elinor relays her proposal through Mrs. Jennings." />

Edward's readiness to accept a proposal from Elinor: While there is no explicit information about Edward's feelings towards Elinor's proposal, he does not express any unwillingness when the idea is conveyed through Mrs. Jennings. This suggests that he may be open to the possibility of marrying Elinor.&#10;3. Elinor's thoughts and reflections: Upon learning about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, Elinor feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy. She is anxious to know how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation.&#10;4. Preparing Marianne: Recognizing that the topic of Edward's marriage will be unavoidable, Elinor takes it upon herself to inform Marianne of the truth and help her cope with the news without revealing her own distress or resentment towards Edward." />
    <node id="1. Based on the provided narrative, Edward's resolution to marry Lucy Steele stems from a prior engagement he had with her, which Elinor learned about four months ago when Lucy first confided in her. This revelation occurred while Elinor was attending to Marianne during her distress over Willoughby, and Marianne later reproached herself for unknowingly causing Elinor additional pain. Edward's decision to marry Lucy, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne in person and understanding, is a commitment he has made, and time and habit may help him forget his previous feelings for others." />
    <node id=" depending entirely on any particular person, it is not&#10;meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward&#10;will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and&#10;understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to&#10;forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.&quot;--&#10;&#10;&quot;If such is your way of thinking,&quot; said Marianne, &quot;if the loss of what&#10;is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your&#10;resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be&#10;wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For&#10;four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without&#10;being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it&#10;would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to&#10;you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told&#10;me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose&#10;prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me" />
    <node id=" the hearer, for Marianne&#10;listened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the&#10;comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and&#10;all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure&#10;of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but&#10;of imprudence, was readily offered.&#10;&#10;But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.  Edward seemed&#10;a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD&#10;loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!  As for&#10;Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely&#10;incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded&#10;at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of&#10;Edward for her.  She would not even admit it to have been natural; and&#10;Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only&#10;could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.&#10;&#10;Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact&#10;of the engagement, and the length of time it" />
    <node id=", a better knowledge of mankind.&#10;&#10;Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact&#10;of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne's&#10;feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of&#10;detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her&#10;distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first&#10;question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,--&#10;&#10;&quot;How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first came to Barton&#10;Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.&quot;&#10;&#10;At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her&#10;lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;Four months!--Have you known of this four months?&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor confirmed it.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your&#10;heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!&quot;--&#10;&#10;&quot;It was not fit that you should" />
    <node id="1. The &quot;he&quot; referred to in the passage is Edward Ferrars, and the speaker is Elinor Dashwood. She is discussing the preparations necessary for Edward's ordination, which will allow him to become a clergyman. Elinor believes that two or three months will be required for this process. The listener Mrs. Jennings previously assumed that Elinor was speaking about Colonel Brandon, who had offered to help Edward financially during his ordination. However, Elinor clarifies that Colonel Brandon's intentions are not self-serving but rather to assist Edward.&#10;2. The speaker requests assistance for his ordination from the listener because she believes that Mrs. Jennings has misunderstood her previous statement about Colonel Brandon's involvement in the matter. Elinor wishes to make it clear that Colonel Brandon is not marrying her (Elinor) solely for the purpose of providing financial support for Edward's ordination. Instead, Elinor seeks Mrs. Jennings' help in keeping the news of Edward's impending marriage and his need for ordination a secret until she can inform her family through a letter to his brother." />
    <node id=",&quot; said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.  &quot;Then you&#10;would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as&#10;Holborn to-day.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.  One day's delay will not be&#10;very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought&#10;not to be mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.  It is&#10;of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of&#10;course have much to do relative to his ordination.&quot;&#10;&#10;This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.  Why Mr.&#10;Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could&#10;not immediately comprehend.  A few moments' reflection, however,&#10;produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be the man.  Well, so&#10;much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in&#10;readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between&#10;you.  But," />
    <node id="The speakers in the text believe there is no reason for people to make a fuss about money and status because they perceive that Mr. Edward's financial difficulties are primarily caused by his mother's insistence on him marrying a wealthy woman, rather than any genuine need for wealth or high social standing. They argue that even if Lucy has little wealth of her own, she is resourceful and can make the most of what they have, making it possible for them to live comfortably with relatively modest means.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Colonel Brandon's offer of the living of Delaford demonstrates the possibility of alternative sources of income, which could further alleviate any financial concerns. Therefore, the speakers see no need for the emphasis on wealth and status in Mr. Edward and Lucy's marriage, as they believe that Mrs. Ferrars can afford to support her son, and Lucy has the ability to manage their finances wisely.&#10;&#10;This viewpoint reflects a belief that personal relationships and happiness are more important than financial considerations and social standing. The speakers argue that there is no inherent reason why Mr. Edward and Lucy cannot marry based on their affection for each other, rather than their respective wealth or status." />
    <node id=" if he was to be in&#10;the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I&#10;had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is&#10;gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs.&#10;Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins&#10;left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;&#10;and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either of them.  I&#10;have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and&#10;greatness.  There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should&#10;not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her&#10;son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than&#10;any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs.&#10;Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as&#10;good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.  Lord!&#10;how snug they might live in such another" />
    <node id="Mrs. Jennings finds it ridiculous that Colonel Brandon would apologize for the smallness of the parsonage, as she knows it to have five sitting rooms on the ground floor and the ability to make up fifteen beds. She suggests that they should encourage Colonel Brandon to make improvements to the parsonage before Lucy moves in, to ensure their comfort. Despite her belief that the living's income would not be sufficient for their marriage, Mrs. Jennings is confident that the couple will still marry and live at the parsonage." />
    <node id=" it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's&#10;being enough to allow them to marry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year&#10;himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less.  Take my word&#10;for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford&#10;Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't&#10;there.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not&#10;waiting for any thing more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with&#10;his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he&#10;reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.&#10;Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her&#10;congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in&#10;her life.&#10;&#10;Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and&#10;she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their&#10;being all comfortably together" />
    <node id=".&#10;Ferrars!&quot;&#10;&#10;The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation&#10;immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for&#10;the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.&#10;Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still&#10;without forfeiting her expectation of the first.&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,&quot; said she, after the first&#10;ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, &quot;and very likely MAY&#10;be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a&#10;house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor,&#10;and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--and to&#10;you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite&#10;ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some&#10;thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy&#10;goes to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's&#10;being enough to allow them to marry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The" />
    <node id=", and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and&#10;she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their&#10;being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.&#10;So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor&#10;that credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her&#10;friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to&#10;own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion&#10;for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, would&#10;ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in&#10;the world for those she really valued.  As for Colonel Brandon, she was&#10;not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly&#10;anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;&#10;anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely&#10;resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,&#10;of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.&#10;&#10;It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley&#10;Street," />
    <node id=" on their parting, may&#10;perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less&#10;properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Miss Dashwood,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon&#10;as the gentleman had withdrawn, &quot;I do not ask you what the Colonel has&#10;been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of&#10;hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business.&#10;And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you&#10;joy of it with all my heart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, ma'am,&quot; said Elinor.  &quot;It is a matter of great joy to me;&#10;and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly.  There are&#10;not many men who would act as he has done.  Few people who have so&#10;compassionate a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an't the least astonished at it&#10;in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more&#10;likely to happen" />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Marianne Dashwood, and her &quot;dear Edward&quot; (Edward Ferrars) are both quite well now after going through tough times. They are happy in each other's love, having overcome previous trials and persecutions.&#10;&#10;2. Both Marianne and Edward are grateful for the kindness shown by the recipient (Elinor Dashwood) and Mrs. Jennings during their difficult time. Marianne acknowledges that she has informed Edward of this great kindness, which suggests that he too is thankful.&#10;&#10;3. During her recent visit, Marianne spent two happy hours with Edward, and he refused to part from her when she thought it was necessary. This implies that their relationship remains strong despite any challenges they have faced." />
    <node id=" for me will make you pleased to hear such&#10;     a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after&#10;     all the troubles we have went through lately,&#10;     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed&#10;     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered&#10;     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy&#10;     as we must always be in one another's love.  We have&#10;     had great trials, and great persecutions, but&#10;     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge&#10;     many friends, yourself not the least among them,&#10;     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully&#10;     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of&#10;     it.

    <node id="1. The reasons given by Marianne Dashwood for refusing to go to Cleveland are its location in Somersetshire, where she had expected not to go, and the emotional difficulty of visiting a place that was previously associated with her unhappiness due to Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor tries to change her mind by working on other feelings and representing it as a measure that would help them both. She emphasizes the advantages of spending time with the Palmers at Cleveland, which includes an escape from their current situation in London and a delay in their return to Barton, allowing for more privacy during Edward's ordination and impending marriage preparations. Elinor also subtly reminds Marianne that Cleveland is not near the location of Edward's previous engagement, attempting to lessen her emotional attachment to the place as one of pain and sorrow." />
    <node id=" very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with&#10;them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy&#10;of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by&#10;Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his&#10;manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,&#10;induced her to accept it with pleasure.&#10;&#10;When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was&#10;not very auspicious.&#10;&#10;&quot;Cleveland!&quot;--she cried, with great agitation.  &quot;No, I cannot go to&#10;Cleveland.&quot;--&#10;&#10;&quot;You forget,&quot; said Elinor gently, &quot;that its situation is not...that it&#10;is not in the neighbourhood of...&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There,&#10;where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to&#10;go there.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such&#10;feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on&#10;others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which" />
    <node id="In the narrative provided, it is revealed that Mr. Edward Ferrars, brother of Fanny Dashwood, has been engaged for over a year to the speaker's cousin Lucy, despite the fact that nobody else was aware of this engagement. This information has been kept secret due to the disapproval of Mrs. Ferrars, Edward and Fanny's mother, who &quot;can never forget that Edward is her son&quot; and would not approve of such a match, given Lucy's lack of fortune. The situation between Mr. Edward Ferrars and the speaker's cousin Lucy has caused Mrs. Dashwood's indisposition because it has led to the revelation that Robert, Fanny and John Dashwood's son, is now expected to marry Miss Morton, who has a significant fortune of thirty thousand pounds. This news has upset Mrs. Dashwood, as she believes that her own children's prospects have been diminished by this secret engagement." />
    <node id=" looked grave, and seemed to know&#10;something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear any&#10;unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to&#10;their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I&#10;believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will&#10;do very well.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What! is Fanny ill?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is exactly what I said, my dear.  'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs.&#10;Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of&#10;the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars,&#10;the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it&#10;turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.&#10;Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my&#10;cousin Lucy!--There's for you, my dear!--And not a creature knowing a&#10;syllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a&#10;thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their" />
    <node id="&#10;and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to&#10;the first.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, but Miss Dashwood,&quot; speaking triumphantly, &quot;people may say what&#10;they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for it&#10;is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such&#10;ill-natured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think&#10;about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set&#10;it down for certain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,&quot;&#10;said Elinor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than&#10;one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could&#10;expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty&#10;thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at&#10;all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.  And besides that, my cousin&#10;Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr.&#10;Ferrars would be" />
    <node id=" well as&#10;yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a&#10;better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good&#10;husband.&quot;&#10;&#10;John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open&#10;to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially&#10;anybody of good fortune.  He therefore replied, without any resentment,&#10;&#10;&quot;I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,&#10;madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,&#10;but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.&#10;And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her&#10;uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune&#10;as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In&#10;short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom&#10;you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her extremely happy;&#10;and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every&#10;conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has&#10;been dign" />
    <node id=" listened to her praise of Lucy&#10;with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings&#10;talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her&#10;throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel&#10;equal to any thing herself.&#10;&#10;The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their&#10;brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful&#10;affair, and bring them news of his wife.&#10;&#10;&quot;You have heard, I suppose,&quot; said he with great solemnity, as soon as&#10;he was seated, &quot;of the very shocking discovery that took place under&#10;our roof yesterday.&quot;&#10;&#10;They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your sister,&quot; he continued, &quot;has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrars&#10;too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I&#10;will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us&#10;quite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.  But I&#10;would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materially&#10;to be" />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Elinor Dashwood, did not explicitly propose any attempt to dissuade Edward from marrying Lucy Steele in the passage provided. However, she mentions that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she would have tried to convince Edward of its unsuitability due to Lucy's mercenary motives and lack of genuine affection for him.&#10;2. The speaker believes their intervention could have been effective because Elinor is aware of Edward's gentle and mild disposition, which makes him susceptible to persuasion by those he trusts and respects. Furthermore, Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, allowing her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. Therefore, she believes that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing." />
    <node id="1. Elinor was invited into the house because Mr. Dashwood, who accidentally met her, expressed great pleasure in seeing her and assured Elinor that Fanny would be very glad to see her as well. He invited her to come in, and they walked up stairs into the drawing-room together.&#10;2. Marianne did not accompany Elinor because she had refused to meet Mrs. Jennings' friends earlier in the day, showing a lack of interest and patience for staying in town. Additionally, Mr. Dashwood mentioned that he was surprised Marianne did not come with Elinor, implying that she had chosen not to join her sister on this visit." />
    <node id="it, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run&#10;the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had&#10;so much reason to dislike.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the&#10;house, her husband accidentally came out.  He expressed great pleasure&#10;in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in&#10;Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see&#10;her, invited her to come in.&#10;&#10;They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.&#10;&#10;&quot;Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,&quot; said he:--&quot;I will go to her&#10;presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the&#10;world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there&#10;cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great&#10;favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?&quot;--&#10;&#10;Elinor made what excuse she could for her.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am not sorry to see you alone,&quot; he replied, &quot;for I have" />
    <node id="1. The narrative does not provide the exact content of Lucy's letter to Elinor. However, based on the context, it is likely that Lucy wrote about her current situation with Edward and their plans for the future. Given that Lucy and Edward have recently received financial support from Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt, they might be discussing their household arrangements or other practical matters related to their marriage.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that Lucy is writing to Elinor suggests that their relationship remains amicable despite the revelation of Lucy's engagement to Edward. This could indicate that Lucy still values Elinor's friendship and seeks her advice or support, unaware of Elinor's feelings for Edward. Alternatively, Lucy may be trying to maintain a connection with the Dashwood family, particularly since she is now connected to them through Edward.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy's letter also reflects on her current situation with Edward because it shows that they are actively making plans for their future together. This suggests that Lucy is confident in her relationship with Edward and believes that their marriage will proceed as planned. It is possible that Lucy is unaware of the challenges and complications in Edward's life, such as his strained relationship with his mother and the pending ordination process, which may create difficulties for their partnership.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the specific content of Lucy's letter to Elinor is not provided, it likely pertains to her practical plans and arrangements with Edward. The fact that she is writing to Elinor indicates a desire to maintain contact and may suggest confidence in her relationship with Edward. However, this situation also highlights the contrast between Lucy's apparent obliviousness to the challenges facing Edward and Elinor's awareness of these complications." />
    <node id="1. Elinor Dashwood is astonished and confused because she had not expected to see her sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, who rarely visited them despite living in London. Moreover, their last encounter had been quite awkward due to Mrs. Dashwood's refusal to assist the Dashwood sisters financially after their father's death, revealing her selfishness and lack of familial affection.&#10;   &#10;2. The narrator mentions that Mrs. John Dashwood is also much distressed because she feels guilty for not having supported her husband's family as she should have. This guilt is evident in her attempt at cordiality towards Elinor, her concern about not seeing the sisters more often, and her husband's enamored behavior, which highlights his admiration for her affectionate demeanor. The fact that Mrs. Dashwood never speaks of Edward Ferrars' predicament outside her family indicates that she is aware of the scandal caused by his broken engagement with Lucy Steele and feels uncomfortable discussing it." />
    <node id=" means might have been found.  But now it is&#10;all too late.  He must be starved, you know;--that is certain;&#10;absolutely starved.&quot;&#10;&#10;He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance&#10;of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.  But though SHE never&#10;spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on&#10;her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she&#10;entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.  She&#10;even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her&#10;sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of&#10;them;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the&#10;room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every&#10;thing that was most affectionate and graceful.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Edward and Miss Steele: Based on the narrative, it appears that Edward's commitment to marry Lucy Steele stems from a prior engagement, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne Dashwood in person and understanding. Although this decision may have been influenced by social standing or financial considerations due to Lucy's mercenary motives, there is no definitive evidence suggesting that Edward does not genuinely care for her at all. The strength of their relationship remains unclear, but it can be assumed that time and habit might have helped Edward forget his previous feelings for others.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor Dashwood: Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, which allows her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. If she had known about the engagement earlier, she believes she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing. Upon learning about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, Elinor feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy. She is anxious to know how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation.&#10;&#10;3. Marianne Dashwood: Marianne still harbors feelings for Edward despite his previous engagement to Lucy Steele, causing her emotional distress when she learns about their impending marriage. She initially refuses to go to Cleveland due to its location in Somersetshire, where she had expected not to go, and the emotional difficulty of visiting a place that was previously associated with her unhappiness due to Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Ferrars: There is no direct information provided about Mrs. Ferrars' feelings or involvement in Edward's situation. However, considering her strained relationship with him due to her preference for his brother Robert, it can be assumed that she might not support Edward's decision to marry Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the situation between Edward and Miss Steele remains somewhat ambiguous, as their genuine feelings towards each other are not explicitly stated. The involvement and feelings of the other people involved vary, with Elinor showing compassion for Edward while being anxious about the situation, Marianne struggling with her emotions due to her own feelings for Edward, and Mrs. Ferrars potentially disapproving of the engagement due to her strained relationship with Edward." />
    <node id="1. The negative consequences of Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on her younger son Robert instead of Edward are significant. Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him. This act also reinforces Edward's financial dependence on his clergyman position, making it challenging for him to maintain relationships or support a family, given the modest income associated with the role.&#10;2. John Dashwood expresses sympathy for Edward, acknowledging the galling nature of the situation in which his younger brother will possess an estate that might have been his. Mrs. Jennings criticizes Mrs. Dashwood's decision, highlighting the unreasonableness of punishing one son for another's mistakes. It is also suggested that this decision may lead to increased resentment between Edward and Robert, straining their already fraught relationship due to their mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on Robert instead of Edward results in further alienation between Edward and his family, exacerbating his financial struggles and causing frustration among other characters who recognize the unfairness of her actions." />

But as it&#10;is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is one&#10;thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his&#10;mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle&#10;THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's, on&#10;proper conditions.  I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking&#10;over the business.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well!&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a way&#10;of their own.  But I don't think mine would be, to make one son&#10;independent, because another had plagued me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne got up and walked about the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,&quot; continued John,&#10;&quot;than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might&#10;have been his own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him" />
    <node id="1. Colonel Brandon's motive for waiting two or three months for Edward Ferrars' ordination is simply to be of use to Mr. Ferrars. He has no self-serving interests in this matter, as Mrs. Jennings initially assumed. Elinor clarifies that she had personally conveyed the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward, and there is no ulterior motive involved." />
    <node id=", to be sure, he must be ordained in&#10;readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between&#10;you.  But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should not&#10;the Colonel write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's&#10;speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore&#10;only replied to its conclusion.&#10;&#10;&quot;Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to&#10;announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And so YOU are forced to do it.

    <node id="1. Edward's public display of disobedience by choosing to marry Lucy Steele instead of pursuing wealth and status had a significant impact on Elinor and Marianne's relationship. Initially, both sisters felt sympathy for Edward due to his difficult decision and the consequences that followed. Elinor glorified in Edward's integrity, while Marianne forgave all his offenses in compassion for his punishment.&#10;2. However, the subject of Edward's marriage was not one they enjoyed discussing when alone. Elinor avoided it as she wished to do away with the too warm, positive assurances of Marianne regarding Edward's continued affection for herself. On the other hand, Marianne struggled to converse on the topic, which left her dissatisfied with herself due to the comparison it produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.&#10;3. When Elinor learned about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, she took it upon herself to inform Marianne of the truth and help her cope with the news without revealing her own distress or resentment towards Edward. This proved to be a challenging task for Elinor, as she was aware that her narration would ruin what she believed to be her sister's chief consolation – the hope that Edward might still have feelings for Elinor.&#10;4. In terms of coping with the aftermath of Edward's actions, both sisters had different reactions. Elinor, being more practical and reserved, practiced self-command since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement. She did not represent herself as suffering much but rather focused on being a comforter for others in their time of need. In contrast, Marianne listened to the news with horror and cried excessively, struggling to come to terms with the information." />
    <node id=" only knew how&#10;little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the&#10;consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain&#10;to him in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in his&#10;integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his&#10;punishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this public&#10;discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which&#10;either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided it&#10;upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the&#10;too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's&#10;continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and&#10;Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic&#10;which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the&#10;comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.&#10;&#10;She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had&#10;hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of&#10;continual self" />
    <node id=" sister, or any&#10;resentment against Edward.&#10;&#10;Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what she&#10;really believed to be her sister's chief consolation,--to give such&#10;particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good&#10;opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,&#10;which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment&#10;over again.  But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to&#10;be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.&#10;&#10;She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to&#10;represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the&#10;self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward's&#10;engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.&#10;Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given&#10;without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor&#10;impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne&#10;listened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the&#10;comforter of others in" />
    <node id="1. Marianne made significant concessions in an attempt to repair the harm she believed she had caused by her behavior towards Edward and Lucy. These concessions included:&#10;&#10;- Promising never to speak of the affair to anyone with bitterness or resentment.&#10;- Agreeing to meet Lucy without betraying any dislike towards her.&#10;- Accepting the possibility of seeing Edward himself, without showing any decrease in her usual cordiality.&#10;&#10;2. Marianne demonstrated her commitment to keeping these promises by:&#10;   - Attending to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say on the subject with an unchanging complexion and expressing no disagreement or dissent.&#10;   - Listening to praise of Lucy without reacting negatively, despite her dislike for her rival.&#10;   - Showing compassion for Edward's situation and acknowledging his integrity in choosing principle over wealth and status.&#10;&#10;3. Although both Elinor and Marianne initially felt sympathy for Edward, they struggled to discuss the topic when alone. For Marianne, this was because she found it difficult to confront the comparison between her own conduct and Elinor's, which left her feeling dissatisfied with herself due to her previous behavior towards him." />
    <node id="1. The specific procedures and requirements involved in Edward's ordination are not detailed in the narrative. However, it can be inferred that Edward has decided to become an ordained clergyman, which will require training and preparation. This new responsibility may affect his relationship with Elinor, as he must now consider how his career will impact their future together.&#10;&#10;2. Since Edward and Elinor are not yet officially engaged, the news of his ordination may create challenges for their relationship. Edward's new responsibilities could limit their time together, and the financial implications of being a clergyman might also strain their bond. Moreover, Edward's decision to pursue the clergy without consulting Elinor could suggest a lack of consideration for her feelings and opinions, potentially causing tension between them.&#10;&#10;3. Given Mrs. Ferrars' strained relationship with Edward and her preference for his brother Robert, it is unlikely that she will provide any involvement or support for Edward's ordination. In fact, the secrecy surrounding Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele was due to Mrs. Ferrars' disapproval of the match, indicating her desire to control her sons' relationships and marriages based on social status and fortune.&#10;&#10;4. The news of Edward's impending marriage to Elinor may affect Marianne Dashwood in various ways. While she no longer harbors romantic feelings for Edward, she still values him as a friend. Upon learning of his engagement to Elinor, Marianne might experience a range of emotions, from relief that her own feelings did not cause unnecessary heartache to concern for how this will impact her sister's happiness." />
    <node id="The speaker, Elinor Dashwood, implies that she has been harboring feelings for Edward Ferrars despite his prior engagement to Lucy Steele. She shows compassion towards Edward but expresses little sympathy for Lucy. Her disappointment in their relationship is evident when she mentions her anxiety about how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation.&#10;&#10;Regarding the concept of a single and constant attachment, Elinor seems to believe in it, as she has been silently suffering from unrequited love for Edward. Despite knowing about his engagement to Lucy Steele, she does not reveal her feelings or distress, showing that she values loyalty and constancy in romantic relationships. Additionally, when Marianne reproaches herself for causing Elinor extra pain by being indiscreet about Willoughby, Elinor comforts her friend by saying that one cannot always control whom they love or how long those feelings last. This statement suggests that Elinor believes in the idea of having a single and constant attachment, even though she has been affected by the fickleness of romantic feelings in her relationship with Edward." />
    <node id="1. The text does not provide a detailed description of Mrs. Ferrars' reaction to her son Edward's secret engagement to Lucy Steele. However, it is mentioned that she cannot forget that Edward is her son and would not approve of such a match due to Lucy's lack of fortune. This disapproval is likely what led Edward and Lucy to keep their engagement a secret in the first place. There is no mention of any active efforts made by Mrs. Ferrars or others to end the engagement, but it can be inferred that they would have disapproved of it.&#10;&#10;Regarding your other questions:&#10;&#10;2. The text does not explicitly describe the procedures and requirements involved in Edward's ordination. However, it is mentioned that Colonel Brandon has offered Edward a living (a type of ecclesiastical benefice) in his parish, which will allow him to become an ordained clergyman. Elinor clarifies that there are no ulterior motives involved in this offer; Colonel Brandon simply wants to be of use to Edward.&#10;3. The news of Edward's impending marriage to Elinor may affect Marianne Dashwood, who still harbors feelings for him despite his previous engagement to Lucy Steele. However, the text does not provide specific details about how this news will impact Marianne. It is worth noting that Marianne has been recovering from her own romantic disappointments and has come to value Elinor's friendship more than ever.&#10;4. Edward's new responsibilities as an ordained clergyman may create challenges for his relationship with Elinor, but the text does not provide specific details about how this will affect their relationship. It is mentioned that Colonel Brandon's offer has come at a &quot;very convenient time,&quot; suggesting that it may help alleviate some of the financial pressures on Edward and allow him to marry Elinor. However, the practicalities of his new role as a clergyman and how it will impact their relationship remain to be seen." />
    <node id="1. Edward's plans for ordination: Based on the conversation between Elinor and Mr. Dashwood, it is clear that Edward intends to become ordained. The specific procedures and requirements involved in his ordination will be simple, as he only wishes &quot;to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot; There is no detailed information about how this decision will affect Edward's relationship with Elinor, but the narrative suggests that it may create challenges due to their unofficial engagement status and Edward's new responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Edward's relationship with his mother, Mrs. Ferrars: Mr. Dashwood mentions that they plan to keep Edward's plans for ordination concealed from Mrs. Ferrars as long as possible, as she has a strained relationship with him due to her preference for Robert. According to John Dashwood, even though Mrs. Ferrars disowned Edward after his first engagement, she will still be affected by his marriage and may feel sorrow when it takes place. This implies that there is still some emotional connection between mother and son, despite their estrangement.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the information provided comes from eavesdropping on various conversations rather than direct dialogue with the characters in question. While this offers valuable insights, it also means that some details may be incomplete or subject to interpretation based on context." />

Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined&#10;liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot&#10;be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak&#10;as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of&#10;a parent!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! Elinor,&quot; said John, &quot;your reasoning is very good, but it is&#10;founded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edward's unhappy match&#10;takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had&#10;never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may&#10;accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as&#10;possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You surprise me" />
    <node id="1. Elinor must inform Marianne of the truth about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, helping her cope with the news without revealing her own distress or resentment towards Edward. She should also ensure that Marianne understands the necessity of not betraying any uneasiness for her sister or bitterness against Edward and Lucy in front of others.&#10;   &#10;2. Furthermore, Elinor has to encourage Marianne to meet Lucy without showing dislike, maintain cordiality when encountering Edward, and listen to praise of Lucy without reacting negatively. This will help Marianne keep her promises and avoid causing unnecessary pain or tension within the group.&#10;&#10;3. To address the difficulty in discussing the topic between themselves, Elinor could create opportunities for them to talk about their feelings and thoughts on the matter gently. By acknowledging and validating Marianne's emotions, she can help her work through the comparison between her own conduct and Elinor's, fostering understanding and self-compassion in the process." />
    <node id="Marianne Dashwood is being assured that she must keep her promises to not betray any uneasiness for her sister or bitterness against Edward and Lucy Steele in front of others, maintain cordiality when encountering Edward, and listen to praise of Lucy without reacting negatively. This will help Marianne avoid causing unnecessary pain or tension within the group and enable her to process her feelings while maintaining relationships with her loved ones.&#10;&#10;Elinor believes that this situation affects both Marianne's happiness and the potential for regret in several ways:&#10;&#10;1. Emotional well-being: By encouraging Marianne to keep her promises, Elinor aims to protect her emotional state from further distress caused by directly confronting the comparison between her own conduct and Elinor's. This approach fosters understanding and self-compassion within Marianne, helping her work through her feelings without causing unnecessary pain or tension.&#10;2. Maintaining relationships: Keeping her promises allows Marianne to preserve relationships with Edward, Lucy, and other members of their social circle. This is essential for their shared happiness, as it minimizes conflict and maintains harmony within the group.&#10;3. Avoiding regret: By adhering to these commitments, Marianne reduces the likelihood of experiencing future regret over her actions during this challenging time. Keeping her promises enables her to act with grace and maturity, which can lead to personal growth and self-improvement." />
    <node id="1. After learning about Edward Ferrars' plans to marry Lucy Steele, Elinor Dashwood feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy. She is anxious to know how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation. Despite her disappointment in their relationship, she continues to value loyalty and constancy in romantic relationships.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding their future meeting, Elinor does not explicitly mention any plans but takes it upon herself to inform Marianne of the truth and help her cope with the news without revealing her own distress or resentment towards Edward. This shows that she wants to maintain a level of calmness and support for both herself and her sister when they eventually meet Edward again.&#10;&#10;3. Elinor also clarifies Colonel Brandon's motives, emphasizing that there are no ulterior self-serving interests involved in his offer to help Edward with his ordination. This suggests that she wants to ensure clear communication between all parties and maintain a sense of trust and respect among her friends and acquaintances.&#10;&#10;4. While Elinor does not explicitly propose any attempt to dissuade Edward from marrying Lucy Steele in the passage provided, she implies that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she would have tried to convince Edward of its unsuitability due to Lucy's mercenary motives and lack of genuine affection for him. This indicates that she may still hold onto some hope that Edward's decision can be changed or influenced in the future.&#10;&#10;In summary, Elinor reflects on her disappointment in Edward's plans to marry Lucy Steele while maintaining a sense of compassion for him and valuing constancy in romantic relationships. She approaches their future meeting with calmness, support, and clear communication, hoping to maintain trust and respect among all parties involved." />

Marianne's reaction to being in town for over two months is one of increasing impatience and longing for the country.

Colonel Brandon states that he fears &quot;it cannot take place very soon&quot; because he has not yet arranged for the living (a clerical position) that he intends to give to Edward Ferrars. The living is currently tied to a presentation, which means it's owned by someone else and can only be transferred when the owner is ready to do so or meets certain conditions (such as reaching a certain age). This process might take a few months, hence his comment on the delay.&#10;2. Marianne Dashwood is not offended or mortified by this delay because she is unaware of the real reason behind Colonel Brandon's statement. She mistakenly assumes that the Colonel is delaying their marriage due to age, thinking he needs to wait until he is older. In reality, Marianne does not have any negative feelings towards Colonel Brandon, and her lack of offense or mortification highlights her trust in him and her genuine affection for him.">

The narrative does not provide the exact content of Lucy's letter to Elinor. However, based on the context, it is likely that Lucy wrote about her current situation with Edward and their plans for the future. Given that Lucy and Edward have recently received financial support from Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt, they might be discussing their household arrangements or other practical matters related to their marriage.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that Lucy is writing to Elinor suggests that their relationship remains amicable despite the revelation of Lucy's engagement to Edward. This could indicate that Lucy still values Elinor's friendship and seeks her advice or support, unaware of Elinor's feelings for Edward. Alternatively, Lucy may be trying to maintain a connection with the Dashwood family, particularly since she is now connected to them through Edward.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy's letter also reflects on her current situation with Edward because it shows that they are actively making plans for their future together. This suggests that Lucy is confident in her relationship with Edward and believes that their marriage will proceed as planned. It is possible that Lucy is unaware of the challenges and complications in Edward's life, such as his strained relationship with his mother and the pending ordination process, which may create difficulties for their partnership.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the specific content of Lucy's letter to Elinor is not provided, it likely pertains to her practical plans and arrangements with Edward. The fact that she is writing to Elinor indicates a desire to maintain contact and may suggest confidence in her relationship with Edward. However, this situation also highlights the contrast between Lucy's apparent obliviousness to the challenges facing Edward and Elinor's awareness of these complications.">

Elinor Dashwood is astonished and confused because she had not expected to see her sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, who rarely visited them despite living in London. Moreover, their last encounter had been quite awkward due to Mrs. Dashwood's refusal to assist the Dashwood sisters financially after their father's death, revealing her selfishness and lack of familial affection.&#10;   &#10;2. The narrator mentions that Mrs. John Dashwood is also much distressed because she feels guilty for not having supported her husband's family as she should have. This guilt is evident in her attempt at cordiality towards Elinor, her concern about not seeing the sisters more often, and her husband's enamored behavior, which highlights his admiration for her affectionate demeanor. The fact that Mrs. Dashwood never speaks of Edward Ferrars' predicament outside her family indicates that she is aware of the scandal caused by his broken engagement with Lucy Steele and feels uncomfortable discussing it.">

This revelation occurred while Elinor was attending to Marianne during her distress over Willoughby, and Marianne later reproached herself for unknowingly causing Elinor additional pain. Edward's decision to marry Lucy, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne in person and understanding, is a commitment he has made, and time and habit may help him forget his previous feelings for others.">

Edward's relationship with his mother, Mrs. Ferrars: Mr. Dashwood mentions that they plan to keep Edward's plans for ordination concealed from Mrs. Ferrars as long as possible, as she has a strained relationship with him due to her preference for Robert. According to John Dashwood, even though Mrs. Ferrars disowned Edward after his first engagement, she will still be affected by his marriage and may feel sorrow when it takes place. This implies that there is still some emotional connection between mother and son, despite their estrangement.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the information provided comes from eavesdropping on various conversations rather than direct dialogue with the characters in question. While this offers valuable insights, it also means that some details may be incomplete or subject to interpretation based on context.">

The negative consequences of Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on her younger son Robert instead of Edward are significant. Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him. This act also reinforces Edward's financial dependence on his clergyman position, making it challenging for him to maintain relationships or support a family, given the modest income associated with the role.&#10;2. John Dashwood expresses sympathy for Edward, acknowledging the galling nature of the situation in which his younger brother will possess an estate that might have been his. Mrs. Jennings criticizes Mrs. Dashwood's decision, highlighting the unreasonableness of punishing one son for another's mistakes. It is also suggested that this decision may lead to increased resentment between Edward and Robert, straining their already fraught relationship due to their mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on Robert instead of Edward results in further alienation between Edward and his family, exacerbating his financial struggles and causing frustration among other characters who recognize the unfairness of her actions.">

The negative consequences of Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on her younger son Robert instead of Edward are significant. Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him. This act also reinforces Edward's financial dependence on his clergyman position, making it challenging for him to maintain relationships or support a family, given the modest income associated with the role.&#10;2. John Dashwood expresses sympathy for Edward, acknowledging the galling nature of the situation in which his younger brother will possess an estate that might have been his. Mrs. Jennings criticizes Mrs. Dashwood's decision, highlighting the unreasonableness of punishing one son for another's mistakes. It is also suggested that this decision may lead to increased resentment between Edward and Robert, straining their already fraught relationship due to their mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on Robert instead of Edward results in further alienation between Edward and his family, exacerbating his financial struggles and causing frustration among other characters who recognize the unfairness of her actions.">

She is discussing the preparations necessary for Edward's ordination, which will allow him to become a clergyman. Elinor believes that two or three months will be required for this process. The listener Mrs. Jennings previously assumed that Elinor was speaking about Colonel Brandon, who had offered to help Edward financially during his ordination. However, Elinor clarifies that Colonel Brandon's intentions are not self-serving but rather to assist Edward.&#10;2. The speaker requests assistance for his ordination from the listener because she believes that Mrs. Jennings has misunderstood her previous statement about Colonel Brandon's involvement in the matter. Elinor wishes to make it clear that Colonel Brandon is not marrying her (Elinor) solely for the purpose of providing financial support for Edward's ordination. Instead, Elinor seeks Mrs. Jennings' help in keeping the news of Edward's impending marriage and his need for ordination a secret until she can inform her family through a letter to his brother.">

The specific procedures and requirements involved in his ordination will be simple, as he only wishes &quot;to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot; There is no detailed information about how this decision will affect Edward's relationship with Elinor, but the narrative suggests that it may create challenges due to their unofficial engagement status and Edward's new responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Edward's relationship with his mother, Mrs. Ferrars: Mr. Dashwood mentions that they plan to keep Edward's plans for ordination concealed from Mrs. Ferrars as long as possible, as she has a strained relationship with him due to her preference for Robert. According to John Dashwood, even though Mrs. Ferrars disowned Edward after his first engagement, she will still be affected by his marriage and may feel sorrow when it takes place. This implies that there is still some emotional connection between mother and son, despite their estrangement.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the information provided comes from eavesdropping on various conversations rather than direct dialogue with the characters in question.

The narrative does not provide the exact content of Lucy's letter to Elinor. However, based on the context, it is likely that Lucy wrote about her current situation with Edward and their plans for the future. Given that Lucy and Edward have recently received financial support from Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt, they might be discussing their household arrangements or other practical matters related to their marriage.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that Lucy is writing to Elinor suggests that their relationship remains amicable despite the revelation of Lucy's engagement to Edward. This could indicate that Lucy still values Elinor's friendship and seeks her advice or support, unaware of Elinor's feelings for Edward. Alternatively, Lucy may be trying to maintain a connection with the Dashwood family, particularly since she is now connected to them through Edward.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy's letter also reflects on her current situation with Edward because it shows that they are actively making plans for their future together. This suggests that Lucy is confident in her relationship with Edward and believes that their marriage will proceed as planned.

The narrator mentions that Mrs. John Dashwood is also much distressed because she feels guilty for not having supported her husband's family as she should have. This guilt is evident in her attempt at cordiality towards Elinor, her concern about not seeing the sisters more often, and her husband's enamored behavior, which highlights his admiration for her affectionate demeanor. The fact that Mrs. Dashwood never speaks of Edward Ferrars' predicament outside her family indicates that she is aware of the scandal caused by his broken engagement with Lucy Steele and feels uncomfortable discussing it.">

Edward and Miss Steele: Based on the narrative, it appears that Edward's commitment to marry Lucy Steele stems from a prior engagement, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne Dashwood in person and understanding. Although this decision may have been influenced by social standing or financial considerations due to Lucy's mercenary motives, there is no definitive evidence suggesting that Edward does not genuinely care for her at all. The strength of their relationship remains unclear, but it can be assumed that time and habit might have helped Edward forget his previous feelings for others.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor Dashwood: Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, which allows her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. If she had known about the engagement earlier, she believes she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing. Upon learning about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, Elinor feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy. She is anxious to know how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation.&#10;&#10;3. Marianne Dashwood: Marianne still harbors feelings for Edward despite his previous engagement to Lucy Steele, causing her emotional distress when she learns about their impending marriage. She initially refuses to go to Cleveland due to its location in Somersetshire, where she had expected not to go, and the emotional difficulty of visiting a place that was previously associated with her unhappiness due to Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Ferrars: There is no direct information provided about Mrs. Ferrars' feelings or involvement in Edward's situation. However, considering her strained relationship with him due to her preference for his brother Robert, it can be assumed that she might not support Edward's decision to marry Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the situation between Edward and Miss Steele remains somewhat ambiguous, as their genuine feelings towards each other are not explicitly stated. The involvement and feelings of the other people involved vary, with Elinor showing compassion for Edward while being anxious about the situation, Marianne struggling with her emotions due to her own feelings for Edward, and Mrs. Ferrars potentially disapproving of the engagement due to her strained relationship with Edward.">

Edward's public display of disobedience by choosing to marry Lucy Steele instead of pursuing wealth and status had a significant impact on Elinor and Marianne's relationship. Initially, both sisters felt sympathy for Edward due to his difficult decision and the consequences that followed. Elinor glorified in Edward's integrity, while Marianne forgave all his offenses in compassion for his punishment.&#10;2. However, the subject of Edward's marriage was not one they enjoyed discussing when alone. Elinor avoided it as she wished to do away with the too warm, positive assurances of Marianne regarding Edward's continued affection for herself. On the other hand, Marianne struggled to converse on the topic, which left her dissatisfied with herself due to the comparison it produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.&#10;3. When Elinor learned about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, she took it upon herself to inform Marianne of the truth and help her cope with the news without revealing her own distress or resentment towards Edward. This proved to be a challenging task for Elinor, as she was aware that her narration would ruin what she believed to be her sister's chief consolation – the hope that Edward might still have feelings for Elinor.&#10;4. In terms of coping with the aftermath of Edward's actions, both sisters had different reactions. Elinor, being more practical and reserved, practiced self-command since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement. She did not represent herself as suffering much but rather focused on being a comforter for others in their time of need. In contrast, Marianne listened to the news with horror and cried excessively, struggling to come to terms with the information.">

Despite knowing about his engagement to Lucy Steele, she does not reveal her feelings or distress, showing that she values loyalty and constancy in romantic relationships. Additionally, when Marianne reproaches herself for causing Elinor extra pain by being indiscreet about Willoughby, Elinor comforts her friend by saying that one cannot always control whom they love or how long those feelings last.

However, she mentions that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she would have tried to convince Edward of its unsuitability due to Lucy's mercenary motives and lack of genuine affection for him.&#10;2. The speaker believes their intervention could have been effective because Elinor is aware of Edward's gentle and mild disposition, which makes him susceptible to persuasion by those he trusts and respects.

Therefore, she believes that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing.">

The narrative does not provide the exact content of Lucy's letter to Elinor. However, based on the context, it is likely that Lucy wrote about her current situation with Edward and their plans for the future. Given that Lucy and Edward have recently received financial support from Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt, they might be discussing their household arrangements or other practical matters related to their marriage.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that Lucy is writing to Elinor suggests that their relationship remains amicable despite the revelation of Lucy's engagement to Edward. This could indicate that Lucy still values Elinor's friendship and seeks her advice or support, unaware of Elinor's feelings for Edward. Alternatively, Lucy may be trying to maintain a connection with the Dashwood family, particularly since she is now connected to them through Edward.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy's letter also reflects on her current situation with Edward because it shows that they are actively making plans for their future together. This suggests that Lucy is confident in her relationship with Edward and believes that their marriage will proceed as planned. It is possible that Lucy is unaware of the challenges and complications in Edward's life, such as his strained relationship with his mother and the pending ordination process, which may create difficulties for their partnership.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the specific content of Lucy's letter to Elinor is not provided, it likely pertains to her practical plans and arrangements with Edward. The fact that she is writing to Elinor indicates a desire to maintain contact and may suggest confidence in her relationship with Edward.

Edward and Miss Steele: Based on the narrative, it appears that Edward's commitment to marry Lucy Steele stems from a prior engagement, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne Dashwood in person and understanding. Although this decision may have been influenced by social standing or financial considerations due to Lucy's mercenary motives, there is no definitive evidence suggesting that Edward does not genuinely care for her at all. The strength of their relationship remains unclear, but it can be assumed that time and habit might have helped Edward forget his previous feelings for others.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor Dashwood: Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, which allows her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. If she had known about the engagement earlier, she believes she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing. Upon learning about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, Elinor feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy.

Marianne Dashwood: Marianne still harbors feelings for Edward despite his previous engagement to Lucy Steele, causing her emotional distress when she learns about their impending marriage. She initially refuses to go to Cleveland due to its location in Somersetshire, where she had expected not to go, and the emotional difficulty of visiting a place that was previously associated with her unhappiness due to Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Ferrars: There is no direct information provided about Mrs. Ferrars' feelings or involvement in Edward's situation. However, considering her strained relationship with him due to her preference for his brother Robert, it can be assumed that she might not support Edward's decision to marry Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the situation between Edward and Miss Steele remains somewhat ambiguous, as their genuine feelings towards each other are not explicitly stated. The involvement and feelings of the other people involved vary, with Elinor showing compassion for Edward while being anxious about the situation, Marianne struggling with her emotions due to her own feelings for Edward, and Mrs. Ferrars potentially disapproving of the engagement due to her strained relationship with Edward.">

The negative consequences of Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on her younger son Robert instead of Edward are significant. Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him. This act also reinforces Edward's financial dependence on his clergyman position, making it challenging for him to maintain relationships or support a family, given the modest income associated with the role.&#10;2. John Dashwood expresses sympathy for Edward, acknowledging the galling nature of the situation in which his younger brother will possess an estate that might have been his. Mrs. Jennings criticizes Mrs. Dashwood's decision, highlighting the unreasonableness of punishing one son for another's mistakes. It is also suggested that this decision may lead to increased resentment between Edward and Robert, straining their already fraught relationship due to their mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on Robert instead of Edward results in further alienation between Edward and his family, exacerbating his financial struggles and causing frustration among other characters who recognize the unfairness of her actions.">

Edward's public display of disobedience by choosing to marry Lucy Steele instead of pursuing wealth and status had a significant impact on Elinor and Marianne's relationship. Initially, both sisters felt sympathy for Edward due to his difficult decision and the consequences that followed. Elinor glorified in Edward's integrity, while Marianne forgave all his offenses in compassion for his punishment.&#10;2. However, the subject of Edward's marriage was not one they enjoyed discussing when alone. Elinor avoided it as she wished to do away with the too warm, positive assurances of Marianne regarding Edward's continued affection for herself. On the other hand, Marianne struggled to converse on the topic, which left her dissatisfied with herself due to the comparison it produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.&#10;3. When Elinor learned about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, she took it upon herself to inform Marianne of the truth and help her cope with the news without revealing her own distress or resentment towards Edward. This proved to be a challenging task for Elinor, as she was aware that her narration would ruin what she believed to be her sister's chief consolation – the hope that Edward might still have feelings for Elinor.&#10;4. In terms of coping with the aftermath of Edward's actions, both sisters had different reactions. Elinor, being more practical and reserved, practiced self-command since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement. She did not represent herself as suffering much but rather focused on being a comforter for others in their time of need. In contrast, Marianne listened to the news with horror and cried excessively, struggling to come to terms with the information.">

However, it can be inferred that Edward has decided to become an ordained clergyman, which will require training and preparation. This new responsibility may affect his relationship with Elinor, as he must now consider how his career will impact their future together.&#10;&#10;2. Since Edward and Elinor are not yet officially engaged, the news of his ordination may create challenges for their relationship. Edward's new responsibilities could limit their time together, and the financial implications of being a clergyman might also strain their bond. Moreover, Edward's decision to pursue the clergy without consulting Elinor could suggest a lack of consideration for her feelings and opinions, potentially causing tension between them.&#10;&#10;3. Given Mrs. Ferrars' strained relationship with Edward and her preference for his brother Robert, it is unlikely that she will provide any involvement or support for Edward's ordination. In fact, the secrecy surrounding Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele was due to Mrs. Ferrars' disapproval of the match, indicating her desire to control her sons' relationships and marriages based on social status and fortune.&#10;&#10;4. The news of Edward's impending marriage to Elinor may affect Marianne Dashwood in various ways. While she no longer harbors romantic feelings for Edward, she still values him as a friend. Upon learning of his engagement to Elinor, Marianne might experience a range of emotions, from relief that her own feelings did not cause unnecessary heartache to concern for how this will impact her sister's happiness.">

Additionally, when Marianne reproaches herself for causing Elinor extra pain by being indiscreet about Willoughby, Elinor comforts her friend by saying that one cannot always control whom they love or how long those feelings last.

Emotional well-being: By encouraging Marianne to keep her promises, Elinor aims to protect her emotional state from further distress caused by directly confronting the comparison between her own conduct and Elinor's. This approach fosters understanding and self-compassion within Marianne, helping her work through her feelings without causing unnecessary pain or tension.&#10;2. Maintaining relationships: Keeping her promises allows Marianne to preserve relationships with Edward, Lucy, and other members of their social circle. This is essential for their shared happiness, as it minimizes conflict and maintains harmony within the group.&#10;3. Avoiding regret: By adhering to these commitments, Marianne reduces the likelihood of experiencing future regret over her actions during this challenging time. Keeping her promises enables her to act with grace and maturity, which can lead to personal growth and self-improvement.">

Elinor also subtly reminds Marianne that Cleveland is not near the location of Edward's previous engagement, attempting to lessen her emotional attachment to the place as one of pain and sorrow." target="1. Edward and Miss Steele: Based on the narrative, it appears that Edward's commitment to marry Lucy Steele stems from a prior engagement, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne Dashwood in person and understanding. Although this decision may have been influenced by social standing or financial considerations due to Lucy's mercenary motives, there is no definitive evidence suggesting that Edward does not genuinely care for her at all. The strength of their relationship remains unclear, but it can be assumed that time and habit might have helped Edward forget his previous feelings for others.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor Dashwood: Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, which allows her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. If she had known about the engagement earlier, she believes she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing. Upon learning about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, Elinor feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy. She is anxious to know how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation.&#10;&#10;3. Marianne Dashwood: Marianne still harbors feelings for Edward despite his previous engagement to Lucy Steele, causing her emotional distress when she learns about their impending marriage. She initially refuses to go to Cleveland due to its location in Somersetshire, where she had expected not to go, and the emotional difficulty of visiting a place that was previously associated with her unhappiness due to Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Ferrars: There is no direct information provided about Mrs. Ferrars' feelings or involvement in Edward's situation. However, considering her strained relationship with him due to her preference for his brother Robert, it can be assumed that she might not support Edward's decision to marry Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the situation between Edward and Miss Steele remains somewhat ambiguous, as their genuine feelings towards each other are not explicitly stated. The involvement and feelings of the other people involved vary, with Elinor showing compassion for Edward while being anxious about the situation, Marianne struggling with her emotions due to her own feelings for Edward, and Mrs. Ferrars potentially disapproving of the engagement due to her strained relationship with Edward.">

This news has upset Mrs. Dashwood, as she believes that her own children's prospects have been diminished by this secret engagement." target="1. The negative consequences of Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on her younger son Robert instead of Edward are significant. Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him. This act also reinforces Edward's financial dependence on his clergyman position, making it challenging for him to maintain relationships or support a family, given the modest income associated with the role.&#10;2. John Dashwood expresses sympathy for Edward, acknowledging the galling nature of the situation in which his younger brother will possess an estate that might have been his. Mrs. Jennings criticizes Mrs. Dashwood's decision, highlighting the unreasonableness of punishing one son for another's mistakes. It is also suggested that this decision may lead to increased resentment between Edward and Robert, straining their already fraught relationship due to their mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on Robert instead of Edward results in further alienation between Edward and his family, exacerbating his financial struggles and causing frustration among other characters who recognize the unfairness of her actions.">

However, it can be inferred that Edward has decided to become an ordained clergyman, which will require training and preparation. This new responsibility may affect his relationship with Elinor, as he must now consider how his career will impact their future together.&#10;&#10;2. Since Edward and Elinor are not yet officially engaged, the news of his ordination may create challenges for their relationship. Edward's new responsibilities could limit their time together, and the financial implications of being a clergyman might also strain their bond. Moreover, Edward's decision to pursue the clergy without consulting Elinor could suggest a lack of consideration for her feelings and opinions, potentially causing tension between them.&#10;&#10;3. Given Mrs. Ferrars' strained relationship with Edward and her preference for his brother Robert, it is unlikely that she will provide any involvement or support for Edward's ordination. In fact, the secrecy surrounding Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele was due to Mrs. Ferrars' disapproval of the match, indicating her desire to control her sons' relationships and marriages based on social status and fortune.&#10;&#10;4. The news of Edward's impending marriage to Elinor may affect Marianne Dashwood in various ways. While she no longer harbors romantic feelings for Edward, she still values him as a friend.

Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,&#10;but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.&#10;And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her&#10;uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune&#10;as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary.

However, she mentions that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she would have tried to convince Edward of its unsuitability due to Lucy's mercenary motives and lack of genuine affection for him.&#10;2. The speaker believes their intervention could have been effective because Elinor is aware of Edward's gentle and mild disposition, which makes him susceptible to persuasion by those he trusts and respects. Furthermore, Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, allowing her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. Therefore, she believes that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing." target="1. The narrative does not provide the exact content of Lucy's letter to Elinor. However, based on the context, it is likely that Lucy wrote about her current situation with Edward and their plans for the future. Given that Lucy and Edward have recently received financial support from Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt, they might be discussing their household arrangements or other practical matters related to their marriage.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that Lucy is writing to Elinor suggests that their relationship remains amicable despite the revelation of Lucy's engagement to Edward. This could indicate that Lucy still values Elinor's friendship and seeks her advice or support, unaware of Elinor's feelings for Edward. Alternatively, Lucy may be trying to maintain a connection with the Dashwood family, particularly since she is now connected to them through Edward.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy's letter also reflects on her current situation with Edward because it shows that they are actively making plans for their future together. This suggests that Lucy is confident in her relationship with Edward and believes that their marriage will proceed as planned. It is possible that Lucy is unaware of the challenges and complications in Edward's life, such as his strained relationship with his mother and the pending ordination process, which may create difficulties for their partnership.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the specific content of Lucy's letter to Elinor is not provided, it likely pertains to her practical plans and arrangements with Edward. The fact that she is writing to Elinor indicates a desire to maintain contact and may suggest confidence in her relationship with Edward. However, this situation also highlights the contrast between Lucy's apparent obliviousness to the challenges facing Edward and Elinor's awareness of these complications.">

Therefore, she believes that if she had known about the engagement earlier, she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing." target="1. Edward and Miss Steele: Based on the narrative, it appears that Edward's commitment to marry Lucy Steele stems from a prior engagement, despite his initial belief that no one could surpass Marianne Dashwood in person and understanding. Although this decision may have been influenced by social standing or financial considerations due to Lucy's mercenary motives, there is no definitive evidence suggesting that Edward does not genuinely care for her at all. The strength of their relationship remains unclear, but it can be assumed that time and habit might have helped Edward forget his previous feelings for others.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor Dashwood: Elinor has a close relationship with Edward as a friend and confidante, which allows her to communicate openly with him about his concerns and feelings. If she had known about the engagement earlier, she believes she could have guided Edward towards making a more informed decision regarding his choice of partner based on mutual respect and affection rather than financial considerations or social standing. Upon learning about Edward's impending marriage to Lucy Steele, Elinor feels compassion for him but harbors little sympathy for Lucy. She is anxious to know how Mrs. Ferrars will react and how Edward will conduct himself during this situation.&#10;&#10;3. Marianne Dashwood: Marianne still harbors feelings for Edward despite his previous engagement to Lucy Steele, causing her emotional distress when she learns about their impending marriage. She initially refuses to go to Cleveland due to its location in Somersetshire, where she had expected not to go, and the emotional difficulty of visiting a place that was previously associated with her unhappiness due to Edward's engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;4. Mrs. Ferrars: There is no direct information provided about Mrs. Ferrars' feelings or involvement in Edward's situation. However, considering her strained relationship with him due to her preference for his brother Robert, it can be assumed that she might not support Edward's decision to marry Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the situation between Edward and Miss Steele remains somewhat ambiguous, as their genuine feelings towards each other are not explicitly stated. The involvement and feelings of the other people involved vary, with Elinor showing compassion for Edward while being anxious about the situation, Marianne struggling with her emotions due to her own feelings for Edward, and Mrs. Ferrars potentially disapproving of the engagement due to her strained relationship with Edward.">

Despite knowing about his engagement to Lucy Steele, she does not reveal her feelings or distress, showing that she values loyalty and constancy in romantic relationships. Additionally, when Marianne reproaches herself for causing Elinor extra pain by being indiscreet about Willoughby, Elinor comforts her friend by saying that one cannot always control whom they love or how long those feelings last. This statement suggests that Elinor believes in the idea of having a single and constant attachment, even though she has been affected by the fickleness of romantic feelings in her relationship with Edward.">

Emotional well-being: By encouraging Marianne to keep her promises, Elinor aims to protect her emotional state from further distress caused by directly confronting the comparison between her own conduct and Elinor's. This approach fosters understanding and self-compassion within Marianne, helping her work through her feelings without causing unnecessary pain or tension.&#10;2. Maintaining relationships: Keeping her promises allows Marianne to preserve relationships with Edward, Lucy, and other members of their social circle. This is essential for their shared happiness, as it minimizes conflict and maintains harmony within the group.&#10;3. Avoiding regret: By adhering to these commitments, Marianne reduces the likelihood of experiencing future regret over her actions during this challenging time.

The negative consequences of Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on her younger son Robert instead of Edward are significant. Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him.

John Dashwood expresses sympathy for Edward, acknowledging the galling nature of the situation in which his younger brother will possess an estate that might have been his. Mrs. Jennings criticizes Mrs. Dashwood's decision, highlighting the unreasonableness of punishing one son for another's mistakes. It is also suggested that this decision may lead to increased resentment between Edward and Robert, straining their already fraught relationship due to their mother's favoritism.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Dashwood's decision to settle the estate on Robert instead of Edward results in further alienation between Edward and his family, exacerbating his financial struggles and causing frustration among other characters who recognize the unfairness of her actions.">

Firstly, this decision worsens the rift between Edward and his mother, as she takes explicit measures to favor Robert over him. This act also reinforces Edward's financial dependence on his clergyman position, making it challenging for him to maintain relationships or support a family, given the modest income associated with the role.&#10;2.

    <edge source="1. Edward's plans for ordination: Based on the conversation between Elinor and Mr. Dashwood, it is clear that Edward intends to become ordained. The specific procedures and requirements involved in his ordination will be simple, as he only wishes &quot;to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot; There is no detailed information about how this decision will affect Edward's relationship with Elinor, but the narrative suggests that it may create challenges due to their unofficial engagement status and Edward's new responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Edward's relationship with his mother, Mrs. Ferrars: Mr. Dashwood mentions that they plan to keep Edward's plans for ordination concealed from Mrs. Ferrars as long as possible, as she has a strained relationship with him due to her preference for Robert. According to John Dashwood, even though Mrs. Ferrars disowned Edward after his first engagement, she will still be affected by his marriage and may feel sorrow when it takes place. This implies that there is still some emotional connection between mother and son, despite their estrangement.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the information provided comes from eavesdropping on various conversations rather than direct dialogue with the characters in question.

Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined&#10;liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot&#10;be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak&#10;as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of&#10;a parent!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! Elinor,&quot; said John, &quot;your reasoning is very good, but it is&#10;founded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edward's unhappy match&#10;takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had&#10;never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may&#10;accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as&#10;possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You surprise me">

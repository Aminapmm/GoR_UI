    <node id="George Sedley Osborne suggested buying tea and sugar from Mr. Figs' father's grocery store as a way to express gratitude towards Figs for fighting on George's behalf against Cuff. The impact of Dobbin's victory on Figs' reputation at school was significant. Before the fight, Figs had been a target of reproach due to his father being a grocer; however, after Dobbin's victory and his magnanimous speech saving his conqueror from a whipping, Figs' nickname became respectable and popular. George Osborne, who also held high popularity among the Swishtail youth, stated that it was not Figs' fault for his father's profession, which led to a consensus of no longer sneering at Dobbin about this accident of birth. The sneak of an usher, who had previously jeered at him, stopped doing so, and &quot;Old Figs&quot; grew to be a name of kindness and endearment. Overall, Dobbin's victory drastically improved Figs' reputation at school." />
    <node id=" fault, sir--not Figs'--not&#10;Dobbin's.  I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.&quot; By&#10;which magnanimous speech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping,&#10;but got back all his ascendancy over the boys which his defeat had&#10;nearly cost him.&#10;&#10;Young Osborne wrote home to his parents an account of the transaction.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sugarcane House, Richmond, March, 18--&#10;&#10;DEAR MAMA,--I hope you are quite well.  I should be much obliged to you&#10;to send me a cake and five shillings. There has been a fight here&#10;between Cuff &amp; Dobbin. Cuff, you know, was the Cock of the School.&#10;They fought thirteen rounds, and Dobbin Licked.  So Cuff is now Only&#10;Second Cock.  The fight was about me.  Cuff was licking me for breaking&#10;a bottle of milk, and Figs wouldn't stand it.  We call him Figs because&#10;his father is a Grocer--Figs &amp; Rudge, Thames St., City--I think as he&#10;fought for me you ought to buy your Tea &amp; Sugar at his father" />
    <node id="--Figs &amp; Rudge, Thames St., City--I think as he&#10;fought for me you ought to buy your Tea &amp; Sugar at his father's.  Cuff&#10;goes home every Saturday, but can't this, because he has 2 Black Eyes.&#10;He has a white Pony to come and fetch him, and a groom in livery on a&#10;bay mare.  I wish my Papa would let me have a Pony, and I am&#10;&#10;Your dutiful Son, GEORGE SEDLEY OSBORNE&#10;&#10;P.S.--Give my love to little Emmy.  I am cutting her out a Coach in&#10;cardboard.  Please not a seed-cake, but a plum-cake.&#10;&#10;&#10;In consequence of Dobbin's victory, his character rose prodigiously in&#10;the estimation of all his schoolfellows, and the name of Figs, which&#10;had been a byword of reproach, became as respectable and popular a&#10;nickname as any other in use in the school.  &quot;After all, it's not his&#10;fault that his father's a grocer,&quot; George Osborne said, who, though a&#10;little chap, had a very high popularity among the Swish" />
    <node id=" his&#10;fault that his father's a grocer,&quot; George Osborne said, who, though a&#10;little chap, had a very high popularity among the Swishtail youth; and&#10;his opinion was received with great applause. It was voted low to sneer&#10;at Dobbin about this accident of birth. &quot;Old Figs&quot; grew to be a name of&#10;kindness and endearment; and the sneak of an usher jeered at him no&#10;longer.&#10;&#10;And Dobbin's spirit rose with his altered circumstances. He made&#10;wonderful advances in scholastic learning.  The superb Cuff himself, at&#10;whose condescension Dobbin could only blush and wonder, helped him on&#10;with his Latin verses; &quot;coached&quot; him in play-hours: carried him&#10;triumphantly out of the little-boy class into the middle-sized form;&#10;and even there got a fair place for him.  It was discovered, that&#10;although dull at classical learning, at mathematics he was uncommonly&#10;quick.  To the contentment of all he passed third in algebra, and got a&#10;French prize-book at the public Midsummer examination. You should have&#10;seen his mother's face when Telemaque" />

Can't you&#10;write to old Mother Figs to-morrow?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't call names,&quot; Dobbin said, getting off the bench very nervous.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir, will you go?&quot; crowed the cock of the school.&#10;&#10;&quot;Put down the letter,&quot; Dobbin replied; &quot;no gentleman readth letterth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, NOW will you go?&quot; says the other.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, I won't.  Don't strike, or I'll THMASH you,&quot; roars out Dobbin,&#10;springing to a leaden inkstand, and looking so wicked, that Mr. Cuff&#10;paused, turned down his coat sleeves again, put his hands into his&#10;pockets, and walked away with a sneer.  But he never meddled personally&#10;with the grocer's boy after that; though we must do him the justice to&#10;say he always spoke of Mr. Dobbin with contempt behind his back.&#10;" />
    <node id=" in algebra, and got a&#10;French prize-book at the public Midsummer examination. You should have&#10;seen his mother's face when Telemaque (that delicious romance) was&#10;presented to him by the Doctor in the face of the whole school and the&#10;parents and company, with an inscription to Gulielmo Dobbin.  All the&#10;boys clapped hands in token of applause and sympathy.  His blushes, his&#10;stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as&#10;he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate? Old Dobbin,&#10;his father, who now respected him for the first time, gave him two&#10;guineas publicly; most of which he spent in a general tuck-out for the&#10;school: and he came back in a tail-coat after the holidays.&#10;&#10;Dobbin was much too modest a young fellow to suppose that this happy&#10;change in all his circumstances arose from his own generous and manly&#10;disposition: he chose, from some perverseness, to attribute his good&#10;fortune to the sole agency and benevolence of little George Osborne, to&#10;whom henceforth he vowed such a love and affection as is" />
    <node id=" Cuff coming up full of pluck, but quite reeling and&#10;groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on his adversary's&#10;nose, and sent him down for the last time.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think that will do for him,&quot; Figs said, as his opponent dropped as&#10;neatly on the green as I have seen Jack Spot's ball plump into the&#10;pocket at billiards; and the fact is, when time was called, Mr.&#10;Reginald Cuff was not able, or did not choose, to stand up again.&#10;&#10;And now all the boys set up such a shout for Figs as would have made&#10;you think he had been their darling champion through the whole battle;&#10;and as absolutely brought Dr. Swishtail out of his study, curious to&#10;know the cause of the uproar.  He threatened to flog Figs violently, of&#10;course; but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing&#10;his wounds, stood up and said, &quot;It's my fault, sir--not Figs'--not&#10;Dobbin's.  I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.&quot; By&#10;" />
    <node id="Rebecca's behavior towards those who helped her before her departure was grateful and affecting. She accepted Amelia's presents with the proper degree of hesitation and reluctance, vowed eternal gratitude to Mrs. Sedley, kissed Mr. Sedley's hand, and asked permission to consider him for the future as her kind friend and protector. She made such an impression that Mr. Sedley was going to write her a cheque for twenty pounds more but restrained his feelings.&#10;&#10;As for Mr. Sedley, he felt neutral about Rebecca's fortunes. He said, &quot;Let Jos marry whom he likes, it's no affair of mine.&quot; He described the young lady as having no fortune and no more had Mrs. Sedley, being good-humored and clever, and will keep him in order, perhaps. He compared her to a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of mahogany grandchildren.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca's behavior towards those who helped her before her departure was grateful and affectionate, while Mr. Sedley felt neutral about it and left the decision to his son Jos." />
    <node id="!&#10;There's nobody like him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nobody,&quot; Rebecca answered.  &quot;How thankful I am to him!&quot; She was&#10;thinking in her heart, &quot;It was George Osborne who prevented my&#10;marriage.&quot;--And she loved George Osborne accordingly.&#10;&#10;She made her preparations for departure with great equanimity; and&#10;accepted all the kind little Amelia's presents, after just the proper&#10;degree of hesitation and reluctance.  She vowed eternal gratitude to&#10;Mrs. Sedley, of course; but did not intrude herself upon that good lady&#10;too much, who was embarrassed, and evidently wishing to avoid her.  She&#10;kissed Mr. Sedley's hand, when he presented her with the purse; and&#10;asked permission to consider him for the future as her kind, kind&#10;friend and protector.  Her behaviour was so affecting that he was going&#10;to write her a cheque for twenty pounds more; but he restrained his&#10;feelings: the carriage was in waiting to take him to dinner, so he&#10;tripped away with a &quot;God bless you, my dear, always come here when you&#10;come to town, you know.--Drive to the Mansion House, James.&quot;&#10;&#10;Finally came the parting with Miss" />
    <node id="Dear Amelia,--I send you the &quot;Orphan of the Forest.&quot; I was too ill to&#10;come yesterday.  I leave town to-day for Cheltenham.  Pray excuse me,&#10;if you can, to the amiable Miss Sharp, for my conduct at Vauxhall, and&#10;entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may have uttered when&#10;excited by that fatal supper.  As soon as I have recovered, for my&#10;health is very much shaken, I shall go to Scotland for some months, and&#10;am&#10;&#10;Truly yours, Jos Sedley&#10;&#10;It was the death-warrant.  All was over.  Amelia did not dare to look&#10;at Rebecca's pale face and burning eyes, but she dropt the letter into&#10;her friend's lap; and got up, and went upstairs to her room, and cried&#10;her little heart out.&#10;&#10;Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, there sought her presently with&#10;consolation, on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially, and relieved&#10;herself a good deal.  &quot;Don't take on, Miss.  I didn't like to tell you.&#10;But none of us in the house have liked her" />
    <node id=".&#10;S., who was a stock-broker's clerk, and we hadn't five hundred pounds&#10;among us, and we're rich enough now.&quot; And Amelia was entirely of this&#10;opinion, to which, gradually, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley was brought.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sedley was neutral.  &quot;Let Jos marry whom he likes,&quot; he said; &quot;it's&#10;no affair of mine.  This girl has no fortune; no more had Mrs. Sedley.&#10;She seems good-humoured and clever, and will keep him in order,&#10;perhaps.  Better she, my dear, than a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of&#10;mahogany grandchildren.&quot;&#10;&#10;So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebecca's fortunes.  She took&#10;Jos's arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sate by&#10;him on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous &quot;buck&quot; he was,&#10;as he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though&#10;nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to&#10;understand it.  All she wanted was the proposal, and" />
    <node id=" engaged as governess.  It will be&#10;seen that the young lady was come into a family of very genteel&#10;connexions, and was about to move in a much more distinguished circle&#10;than that humble one which she had just quitted in Russell Square.&#10;&#10;She had received her orders to join her pupils, in a note which was&#10;written upon an old envelope, and which contained the following words:&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley begs Miss Sharp and baggidge may be hear on Tuesday,&#10;as I leaf for Queen's Crawley to-morrow morning ERLY.&#10;&#10;Great Gaunt Street.&#10;&#10;Rebecca had never seen a Baronet, as far as she knew, and as soon as&#10;she had taken leave of Amelia, and counted the guineas which&#10;good-natured Mr. Sedley had put into a purse for her, and as soon as&#10;she had done wiping her eyes with her handkerchief (which operation she&#10;concluded the very moment the carriage had turned the corner of the&#10;street), she began to depict in her own mind what a Baronet must be. &quot;I&#10;wonder, does he wear a star?&quot; thought she, &quot;or is it only lords" />
    <node id="&quot;Don't,&quot; replied that functionary.  &quot;I hope you've forgot nothink? Miss&#10;'Melia's gownds--have you got them--as the lady's maid was to have 'ad?&#10;I hope they'll fit you. Shut the door, Jim, you'll get no good out of&#10;'ER,&quot; continued John, pointing with his thumb towards Miss Sharp: &quot;a&#10;bad lot, I tell you, a bad lot,&quot; and so saying, Mr. Sedley's groom&#10;drove away.  The truth is, he was attached to the lady's maid in&#10;question, and indignant that she should have been robbed of her&#10;perquisites.&#10;&#10;On entering the dining-room, by the orders of the individual in&#10;gaiters, Rebecca found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms&#10;usually are, when genteel families are out of town.  The faithful&#10;chambers seem, as it were, to mourn the absence of their masters.  The&#10;turkey carpet has rolled itself up, and retired sulkily under the&#10;sideboard: the pictures have hidden their faces behind old sheets of&#10;brown paper: the ceiling lamp is muffled up in a dismal" />

If she did not speak with Rebecca on the tender&#10;subject, she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations&#10;with Mrs. Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, who dropped some hints to the&#10;lady's-maid, who may have cursorily mentioned the matter to the cook,&#10;who carried the news, I have no doubt, to all the tradesmen, so that&#10;Mr. Jos's marriage was now talked of by a very considerable number of&#10;persons in the Russell Square world.&#10;&#10;It was, of course, Mrs. Sedley's opinion that her son would demean&#10;himself by a marriage with an artist's daughter.  &quot;But, lor', Ma'am,&quot;&#10;ejaculated Mrs. Blenkinsop, &quot;we was only grocers when we married Mr.&#10;S., who was a stock-broker's clerk, and we hadn't five hundred pounds&#10;among us, and we're rich enough now.&quot;" />
    <node id="The worthy Baronet that Jehu drove to the City is Sir Pitt Crawley. He refused to pay more than the fare despite Jehu's appeals and threats because he wanted to see if Jehu could do him harm, implying that he enjoyed the idea of challenging someone or testing their courage." />

It was in vain that Jehu appealed and&#10;stormed; that he flung down Miss Sharp's bandboxes in the gutter at the&#10;'Necks, and swore he would take the law of his fare.&#10;&#10;&quot;You'd better not,&quot; said one of the ostlers; &quot;it's Sir Pitt Crawley.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So it is, Joe,&quot; cried the Baronet, approvingly; &quot;and I'd like to see&#10;the man can do me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So should oi,&quot; said Joe, grinning sulkily, and mounting the Baronet's&#10;baggage on the roof of the coach.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep the box for me, Leader,&quot; exclaims the Member of Parliament to the&#10;coachman; who replied, &quot;Yes, Sir Pitt,&quot; with a touch of his hat, and&#10;rage in his soul (for he had promised the box to a young gentleman from&#10;Cambridge, who would have given a crown to a certainty), and Miss Sharp&#10;was accommodated with a back seat inside the carriage, which might be&#10;said to be carrying her into" />

When she went to&#10;sleep, Rebecca chose that one to dream about.&#10;&#10;At four o'clock, on such a roseate summer's morning as even made Great&#10;Gaunt Street look cheerful, the faithful Tinker, having wakened her&#10;bedfellow, and bid her prepare for departure, unbarred and unbolted the&#10;great hall door (the clanging and clapping whereof startled the&#10;sleeping echoes in the street), and taking her way into Oxford Street,&#10;summoned a coach from a stand there.  It is needless to particularize&#10;the number of the vehicle, or to state that the driver was stationed&#10;thus early in the neighbourhood of Swallow Street, in hopes that some&#10;young buck, reeling homeward from the tavern, might need the aid of his&#10;vehicle, and pay him with the generosity of intoxication.&#10;&#10;It is likewise needless to say that the driver, if he had any such&#10;hopes as those above stated, was grossly disappointed; and that the&#10;worthy Baronet whom he drove to the City did not give him one single&#10;penny more than his fare.  It was in vain that" />

    <node id=" thrilling interest, through the fiery chapters of&#10;which the reader should hurry, panting.  But my readers must hope for&#10;no such romance, only a homely story, and must be content with a&#10;chapter about Vauxhall, which is so short that it scarce deserves to be&#10;called a chapter at all.  And yet it is a chapter, and a very important&#10;one too.  Are not there little chapters in everybody's life, that seem&#10;to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the history?&#10;&#10;Let us then step into the coach with the Russell Square party, and be&#10;off to the Gardens.  There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp,&#10;who are on the front seat.  Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite,&#10;between Captain Dobbin and Amelia.&#10;&#10;Every soul in the coach agreed that on that night Jos would propose to&#10;make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley.  The parents at home had acquiesced in&#10;the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a&#10;feeling very much akin to contempt for his son.  He said he was vain,&#10;selfish, lazy, and effeminate.  He could not endure his airs" />

But the writer of these pages, who has pursued in&#10;former days, and in the same bright weather, the same remarkable&#10;journey, cannot but think of it with a sweet and tender regret.  Where&#10;is the road now, and its merry incidents of life? Is there no Chelsea&#10;or Greenwich for the old honest pimple-nosed coachmen?  I wonder where&#10;are they, those good fellows? Is old Weller alive or dead? and the&#10;waiters, yea, and the inns at which they waited, and the cold rounds of&#10;beef inside, and the stunted ostler, with his blue nose and clinking&#10;pail, where is he, and where is" />
    <node id=" great number of the crowd, who vanished&#10;presently before his cocked hat and fierce appearance--and he entered&#10;the box in a most agitated state.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good Heavens! Dobbin, where have you been?&quot; Osborne said, seizing the&#10;white cashmere shawl from his friend's arm, and huddling up Amelia in&#10;it.--&quot;Make yourself useful, and take charge of Jos here, whilst I take&#10;the ladies to the carriage.&quot;&#10;&#10;Jos was for rising to interfere--but a single push from Osborne's&#10;finger sent him puffing back into his seat again, and the lieutenant&#10;was enabled to remove the ladies in safety.  Jos kissed his hand to&#10;them as they retreated, and hiccupped out &quot;Bless you! Bless you!&quot; Then,&#10;seizing Captain Dobbin's hand, and weeping in the most pitiful way, he&#10;confided to that gentleman the secret of his loves.  He adored that&#10;girl who had just gone out; he had broken her heart, he knew he had, by&#10;his conduct; he would marry her next morning at St. George's, Hanover&#10;Square; he'd knock up the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth:" />
    <node id="Captain William Dobbin, a modest and selfless character, paid for the whole party to enter the Royal Gardens but himself contented with giving an arm to the shawls. He walked behind the rest of the group, carrying a burden of shawls, and seemed uninterested in the various attractions and activities in the Gardens. Instead, he was more focused on watching Amelia's happiness at being paired off with George Osborne.&#10;&#10;The text states that &quot;Captain William Dobbin did not take the slightest notice&quot; of any of the delights of the Gardens, including the extra lamps, fiddlers, singers, dancers, and other amusements. He was preoccupied with his own thoughts and feelings, and his attention was focused on Amelia rather than on the entertainment around him. Despite this, the passage suggests that Dobbin is a kind and selfless person, who takes pleasure in seeing others enjoy themselves, even if he himself does not partake in the fun." />
    <node id=" fellow.&quot; And so while he paired off with Miss Sedley,&#10;and Jos squeezed through the gate into the gardens with Rebecca at his&#10;side, honest Dobbin contented himself by giving an arm to the shawls,&#10;and by paying at the door for the whole party.&#10;&#10;He walked very modestly behind them.  He was not willing to spoil&#10;sport.  About Rebecca and Jos he did not care a fig.  But he thought&#10;Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Osborne, and as he saw that&#10;good-looking couple threading the walks to the girl's delight and&#10;wonder, he watched her artless happiness with a sort of fatherly&#10;pleasure.  Perhaps he felt that he would have liked to have something&#10;on his own arm besides a shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky&#10;young officer carrying this female burthen); but William Dobbin was&#10;very little addicted to selfish calculation at all; and so long as his&#10;friend was enjoying himself, how should he be discontented? And the&#10;truth is, that of all the delights of the Gardens; of the hundred&#10;thousand extra lamps, which were always lighted; the fiddlers" />
    <node id="truth is, that of all the delights of the Gardens; of the hundred&#10;thousand extra lamps, which were always lighted; the fiddlers in cocked&#10;hats, who played ravishing melodies under the gilded cockle-shell in&#10;the midst of the gardens; the singers, both of comic and sentimental&#10;ballads, who charmed the ears there; the country dances, formed by&#10;bouncing cockneys and cockneyesses, and executed amidst jumping,&#10;thumping and laughter; the signal which announced that Madame Saqui was&#10;about to mount skyward on a slack-rope ascending to the stars; the&#10;hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage; the dark walks, so&#10;favourable to the interviews of young lovers; the pots of stout handed&#10;about by the people in the shabby old liveries; and the twinkling&#10;boxes, in which the happy feasters made-believe to eat slices of almost&#10;invisible ham--of all these things, and of the gentle Simpson, that&#10;kind smiling idiot, who, I daresay, presided even then over the&#10;place--Captain William Dobbin did not take the slightest notice.&#10;&#10;He carried" />
    <node id=" and though&#10;nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to&#10;understand it.

As the majestic&#10;Jos stepped out of the creaking vehicle the crowd gave a cheer for the&#10;fat gentleman, who blushed and looked very big and mighty, as he walked&#10;away with Rebecca under his arm.  George, of course, took charge of&#10;Amelia.  She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.&#10;&#10;&quot;I say, Dobbin,&quot; says George, &quot;just look to the shawls and things,&#10;there's a good fellow.&quot; And so while he paired off with Miss Sedley,&#10;and Jos squeezed through the gate into the gardens with Rebecca at his&#10;side, honest Dob" />

Why, man, you couldn't stand--you made everybody laugh in the&#10;Gardens, though you were crying yourself.  You were maudlin, Jos.&#10;Don't you remember singing a song?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A what?&quot; Jos asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;A sentimental song, and calling Rosa, Rebecca, what's her name,&#10;Amelia's little friend--your dearest diddle-diddle-darling?&quot; And this&#10;ruthless young fellow, seizing hold of Dobbin's hand, acted over the&#10;scene, to the horror of the original performer, and in spite of&#10;Dobbin's good-natured entreaties to him to have mercy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should I spare him?&quot; Osborne said to his friend's remonstrances,&#10;when they quitted the invalid, leaving him under the hands of Doctor&#10;Gollop.  &quot;What the deuce right has he to give himself his patronizing" />

    <node id="Dobbin reacted to Mr. Cuff's torture of his schoolfellow out of a sense of rebellion against tyranny and possibly harboring feelings of revenge. His motivation was to protect a weaker student from bullying, which was a common practice in public schools at the time. However, it went against the accepted behavior because resistance to such punishment was considered &quot;ungentlemanly.&quot; The culture of public schools often normalized violent practices, and challenging one's tormentor could lead to further ostracization or retaliation. In Dobbin's case, he managed to successfully defend his schoolfellow, ultimately improving the victimized student's reputation at school." />

Osborne mocks Dobbin by acting out the scene, despite Dobbin's pleas for mercy. The reason for Osborne's harsh teasing is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that he is doing it to make fun of Dobbin for losing control of his emotions and for being sentimental. Additionally, Osborne may also be trying to assert his social superiority over Dobbin by mocking him for his lower class background. Osborne does not spare Dobbin's feelings despite his remonstrances because he thinks Dobbin is weak and milksop, and he wants to continue to make fun of him. He also sees Dobbin's relationship with a woman from a lower social class as a &quot;mesalliance&quot; and a threat to his own family's status, so he may be trying to shame Dobbin for associating with someone of lower class." />

This is indicated when Amelia wonders if he will be &quot;awfully proud&quot; and treat her contemptuously, as she expects to be among gentlefolks and not with vulgar city people. Additionally, Jehu, the coachman who drove Sir Pitt to the city, mentions that Sir Pitt wanted to see if he could do him harm, suggesting a challenging or testing personality. Furthermore, Rebecca's curiosity about what a baronet wears (a star or other insignia) indicates that Sir Pitt is a high-ranking nobleman and potentially of significant social standing." />
    <node id=" in her own mind what a Baronet must be. &quot;I&#10;wonder, does he wear a star?&quot; thought she, &quot;or is it only lords that&#10;wear stars? But he will be very handsomely dressed in a court suit,&#10;with ruffles, and his hair a little powdered, like Mr. Wroughton at&#10;Covent Garden.  I suppose he will be awfully proud, and that I shall be&#10;treated most contemptuously.  Still I must bear my hard lot as well as&#10;I can--at least, I shall be amongst GENTLEFOLKS, and not with vulgar&#10;city people&quot;: and she fell to thinking of her Russell Square friends&#10;with that very same philosophical bitterness with which, in a certain&#10;apologue, the fox is represented as speaking of the grapes.&#10;&#10;Having passed through Gaunt Square into Great Gaunt Street, the&#10;carriage at length stopped at a tall gloomy house between two other&#10;tall gloomy houses, each with a hatchment over the middle drawing-room&#10;window; as is the custom of houses in Great Gaunt Street, in which&#10;gloomy locality death seems to reign perpetual.

    <node id="Dobbin intervened when Mr. Cuff was harming his schoolfellow out of a sense of rebellion against tyranny and to protect a weaker student from bullying, which was common in public schools at the time. This action went against the accepted behavior of not resisting such punishment, as it was considered &quot;ungentlemanly.&quot; However, Dobbin's motivation was to defend the victimized student, ultimately improving his reputation at school. Despite the potential social repercussions, including ostracization or further retaliation, Dobbin chose to stand up against his bully, leading to a victory for him and gaining the respect of his peers." />
    <node id="George Osborne suddenly feels guilty after teasing Miss Sharp about Captain Dobbin and her true feelings towards him because he sees that his jokes have caused her distress. He had been mocking Dobbin's love for a woman from a lower social class, and by extension, he may also be implying that he looks down upon Miss Sharp for the same reason. When he sees that his teasing has hurt Miss Sharp's feelings, he feels some remorse for his behavior.&#10;&#10;Additionally, George may also feel guilty because he has unintentionally revealed his own insecurities and jealousy towards Dobbin. By making fun of Dobbin, he is indirectly acknowledging that he sees Dobbin as a rival for Amelia's affections, and this realization may make him feel uncomfortable or threatened.&#10;&#10;Overall, George's guilt arises from a combination of empathy for Miss Sharp's feelings and self-awareness of his own motivations for teasing her." />
    <node id="Mr. Sedley's extreme state of agitation and illness the morning after his wild behavior was primarily due to a massive hangover from excessive alcohol consumption the previous night. The text mentions that he had been &quot;uncommon wild&quot; and had wanted to fight a hackney-coachman, indicating that he was intoxicated. The subsequent headache, groaning, and inability to keep a straight face are all typical symptoms of a hangover." />
    <node id=",&quot; he whispered in&#10;confidence to Osborne, as the latter mounted the stair.  &quot;He wanted to&#10;fight the 'ackney-coachman, sir. The Capting was obliged to bring him&#10;upstairs in his harms like a babby.&quot; A momentary smile flickered over&#10;Mr. Brush's features as he spoke; instantly, however, they relapsed&#10;into their usual unfathomable calm, as he flung open the drawing-room&#10;door, and announced &quot;Mr. Hosbin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How are you, Sedley?&quot; that young wag began, after surveying his&#10;victim.  &quot;No bones broke? There's a hackney-coachman downstairs with a&#10;black eye, and a tied-up head, vowing he'll have the law of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you mean--law?&quot; Sedley faintly asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;For thrashing him last night--didn't he, Dobbin? You hit out, sir,&#10;like Molyneux.  The watchman says he never saw a fellow go down so&#10;straight.  Ask Dobbin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You DID have a round with the coachman,&quot; Captain Dobbin said, &quot;and&#10;" />
    <node id=" morning, which Rebecca thought was to dawn upon her fortune,&#10;found Sedley groaning in agonies which the pen refuses to describe.&#10;Soda-water was not invented yet.  Small beer--will it be believed!--was&#10;the only drink with which unhappy gentlemen soothed the fever of their&#10;previous night's potation.  With this mild beverage before him, George&#10;Osborne found the ex-Collector of Boggley Wollah groaning on the sofa&#10;at his lodgings.  Dobbin was already in the room, good-naturedly&#10;tending his patient of the night before.  The two officers, looking at&#10;the prostrate Bacchanalian, and askance at each other, exchanged the&#10;most frightful sympathetic grins.  Even Sedley's valet, the most solemn&#10;and correct of gentlemen, with the muteness and gravity of an&#10;undertaker, could hardly keep his countenance in order, as he looked at&#10;his unfortunate master.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Sedley was uncommon wild last night, sir,&quot; he whispered in&#10;confidence to Osborne, as the latter mounted the stair.  &quot;He wanted to&#10;fight the 'ackney-coachman," />
    <node id="Miss Amelia and Miss Sharp are eagerly watching for the arrival of Mr. Joseph Sedley and Lieutenant George Osborne because they are interested in these men romantically. Miss Amelia is in love with George, while Miss Sharp has been receiving attention from Mr. Sedley. When George realizes that both women are looking out for their respective suitors, he jokes about the situation, mocking the &quot;dismal condition&quot; of Mr. Sedley and describing his own appearance in a way that he finds humorous. However, this teasing causes Miss Sharp to feel distrust and hatred towards him, as she suspects that he has been making fun of her. Overall, George's reaction to the situation is lighthearted and jokey, but it has unintended consequences for his relationship with Miss Sharp." />
    <node id="The text describes the kind of story that is not being presented as one that focuses on a realistic depiction of everyday life, without resorting to either exaggerated gentility or lowly sensationalism. By describing events in Mr. Sedley's kitchen, such as the love affair between black Sambo and the cook, or the knife-boy stealing a cold shoulder of mutton, the narrative could have provoked laughter and been seen as representing &quot;scenes of life.&quot; Alternatively, by choosing to sensationalize the story with burglars and violence, the author could have constructed a tale of thrilling interest. However, the text explains that the readers should not expect such romantic or sensationalist elements, but rather a realistic portrayal of a stockbroker's family in Russell Square, discussing everyday matters and love interests." />
    <node id=" noble father: or instead of the supremely&#10;genteel, suppose we had resorted to the entirely low, and described&#10;what was going on in Mr. Sedley's kitchen--how black Sambo was in love&#10;with the cook (as indeed he was), and how he fought a battle with the&#10;coachman in her behalf; how the knife-boy was caught stealing a cold&#10;shoulder of mutton, and Miss Sedley's new femme de chambre refused to&#10;go to bed without a wax candle; such incidents might be made to provoke&#10;much delightful laughter, and be supposed to represent scenes of&#10;&quot;life.&quot; Or if, on the contrary, we had taken a fancy for the terrible,&#10;and made the lover of the new femme de chambre a professional burglar,&#10;who bursts into the house with his band, slaughters black Sambo at the&#10;feet of his master, and carries off Amelia in her night-dress, not to&#10;be let loose again till the third volume, we should easily have&#10;constructed a tale of thrilling interest, through the fiery chapters of&#10;which the reader should hurry, panting.

    <node id="1. Mr. Sedley's Neutrality: Although Mr. Sedley initially expresses some reservations about Rebecca's fortune, he ultimately leaves the decision to his son and does not explicitly object to the match. This neutrality can be interpreted as a positive sign for Rebecca's prospects with Jos.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Sedley's Agreement: The text mentions that Mrs. Sedley, who was initially reluctant, gradually agrees to support the match between Rebecca and Jos. This shift in her attitude further indicates that things are looking up for Rebecca's fortunes.&#10;&#10;3. Amelia's Full Support: Amelia has been described as prudent and temperamental but is fully supportive of the marriage. As a close family member, her backing plays a significant role in indicating that Rebecca's marital prospects with Jos are promising.&#10;&#10;4. Understanding of Those Around Them: The people around Rebecca and Jos seem to understand and accept the upcoming marriage as inevitable. This understanding can be seen when nobody says anything on the subject, yet everybody seems to comprehend it. This collective acceptance further strengthens the implication that everything is in favor of Rebecca's fortunes.&#10;&#10;5. Parental Consent: Although not explicitly stated, the narrative implies that Amelia's parents have acquiesced to the arrangement, which indicates a positive outlook for Rebecca's marital prospects with Jos." />
    <node id="The baronet that Sir Pitt Crawley is likely to be is the current owner of the Queen's Crawley estate, which has been in his family for generations. The estate was granted a borough status by Queen Elizabeth I, and although it has become &quot;rotten&quot; over time, it still provides a significant income for the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;According to the dialogue, Sir Pitt Crawley holds the principle of being just before he is generous when it comes to money. He never gave away a farthing in his life and never will because it's against his principle. He takes care of his farthings, believing that they are crucial for accumulating guineas and ensuring financial stability. This suggests that Sir Pitt Crawley values frugality and is careful with his finances, prioritizing them over impulsive or unnecessary spending." />
    <node id=" dowager's dead I&#10;want some one.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was as bad as he,&quot; said Tinker.  &quot;She took the law of every one of&#10;her tradesmen; and turned away forty-eight footmen in four year.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was close--very close,&quot; said the Baronet, simply; &quot;but she was a&#10;valyble woman to me, and saved me a steward.&quot;--And in this confidential&#10;strain, and much to the amusement of the new-comer, the conversation&#10;continued for a considerable time.  Whatever Sir Pitt Crawley's&#10;qualities might be, good or bad, he did not make the least disguise of&#10;them.  He talked of himself incessantly, sometimes in the coarsest and&#10;vulgarest Hampshire accent; sometimes adopting the tone of a man of the&#10;world.  And so, with injunctions to Miss Sharp to be ready at five in&#10;the morning, he bade her good night. &quot;You'll sleep with Tinker&#10;to-night,&quot; he said; &quot;it's a big bed, and there's room for two.

    <node id=" his elegant way,&#10;&quot;Rotten! be hanged--it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley (named after the great Commoner) was the son of&#10;Walpole Crawley, first Baronet, of the Tape and Sealing-Wax Office in&#10;the reign of George II., when he was impeached for peculation, as were&#10;a great number of other honest gentlemen of those days; and Walpole&#10;Crawley was, as need scarcely be said, son of John Churchill Crawley,&#10;named after the celebrated military commander of the reign of Queen&#10;Anne.  The family tree (which hangs up at Queen's Crawley) furthermore&#10;mentions Charles Stuart, afterwards called Barebones Crawley, son of&#10;the Crawley of James the First's time; and finally, Queen Elizabeth's&#10;Crawley, who is represented as the foreground of the picture in his&#10;forked beard and armour.  Out of his waistcoat, as usual, grows a tree,&#10;on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are&#10;inscribed.  Close by the name of Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet (the subject&#10;of the present memoir), are written that of his brother" />

And though, by the&#10;lapse of time, and those mutations which age produces in empires,&#10;cities, and boroughs, Queen's Crawley was no longer so populous a place&#10;as it had been in Queen Bess's time--nay, was come down to that&#10;condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten--yet, as Sir&#10;Pitt Crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way,&#10;&quot;Rotten! be hanged--it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley (named after the" />

    <node id="Jos Sedley sent the &quot;Orphan of the Forest&quot; book to Amelia as an apology for standing her up and behaving inappropriately towards Rebecca at Vauxhall Gardens. In his letter, he also asked Amelia to convey his apologies and request forgiveness from Rebecca regarding his behavior that night. The letter was essentially a break-off communication, informing Amelia of his immediate departure for Cheltenham, followed by a trip to Scotland for his health.&#10;&#10;Amelia was deeply saddened and upset by the news, as she suspected Jos would propose to Rebecca at Vauxhall Gardens. She couldn't bear to look at Rebecca after reading the letter and immediately went upstairs to her room in tears. The housekeeper, Blenkinsop, came to comfort Amelia, sharing that none of the servants liked Rebecca when she worked there as a governess.&#10;&#10;Amelia's parents were also relieved by this decision, having never considered Rebecca a suitable match for their son due to her lack of fortune. Mr. Sedley, initially neutral about the match, agreed it was best not to marry &quot;a black Mrs. Sedley&quot; and have &quot;a dozen mahogany grandchildren.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rebecca had been under the impression that Jos would propose at Vauxhall Gardens; however, Captain Dobbin diverted his attention by taking him to Lambeth Palace, ensuring he wouldn't propose to Rebecca that night. The plan was successful, and Jos never made a formal proposal to Rebecca.&#10;&#10;In summary, Amelia was deeply saddened by the news of Jos breaking off his relationship with Rebecca, while her parents were relieved as they had not considered Rebecca a suitable match for their son. Jos's decision to not marry Rebecca resulted in her making no marriage proposals during her visit to Vauxhall Gardens, and she eventually left town without marrying him." />
    <node id="1. Rebecca's curiosity about the appearance and status of a Baronet, such as wondering if they wear a star or other insignia, reflects her eagerness to learn more about the social standing and expectations of the family she is about to join. As a governess coming from a humble background, she is aware that she will be moving in a &quot;much more distinguished circle&quot; than she is used to. Her musings demonstrate her desire to fit in and make a good impression in her new environment.&#10;2. By depicting in her mind what a Baronet might be like, Rebecca is also trying to prepare herself for the reality of working for a high-ranking nobleman. She wants to understand the potential challenges and opportunities that come with this new position, as well as how she should conduct herself around such an individual.&#10;3. Rebecca's reflections on her new role as a governess and what it entails are intertwined with her curiosity about the Baronet, Sir Pitt Crawley. By understanding more about him, she can better grasp the dynamics of the family and position herself accordingly to ensure success in her new job. This forward-thinking attitude shows Rebecca's determination and adaptability, which will undoubtedly be valuable traits as she navigates this unfamiliar social landscape." />
    <node id=" good conscience, Miss,&quot; said the old&#10;woman.  &quot;There's room for us and a half-dozen of ghosts in it,&quot; says&#10;Rebecca.  &quot;Tell me all about Lady Crawley and Sir Pitt Crawley, and&#10;everybody, my DEAR Mrs. Tinker.&quot;&#10;&#10;But old Tinker was not to be pumped by this little cross-questioner;&#10;and signifying to her that bed was a place for sleeping, not&#10;conversation, set up in her corner of the bed such a snore as only the&#10;nose of innocence can produce.  Rebecca lay awake for a long, long&#10;time, thinking of the morrow, and of the new world into which she was&#10;going, and of her chances of success there.  The rushlight flickered in&#10;the basin.  The mantelpiece cast up a great black shadow, over half of&#10;a mouldy old sampler, which her defunct ladyship had worked, no doubt,&#10;and over two little family pictures of young lads, one in a college&#10;gown, and the other in a red jacket like a soldier. When she went to&#10;sleep, Rebecca chose that one to dream about.&#10;&#10;At four" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it can be inferred that Miss Amelia has romantic feelings for George Osborne, as she looks eagerly towards his residence and seems to care about his opinion of her. However, she also shows some consideration for Captain Dobbin, such as when she realizes that they were unkind to him during their gathering. It is suggested that Amelia may not have given much thought to Captain Dobbin before, but George's teasing behavior might be making her more aware of his affections towards her. Overall, it seems that Amelia has a stronger emotional connection with George, but she also values Captain Dobbin as a friend. The narrative hints at a potential love triangle involving Osborne, Amelia, and Dobbin." />
    <node id="-------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;Captain Dobbin was likely excluded from joining the supper party with Rebecca and Joseph due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the text states that covers were laid for four, indicating that Rebecca and Joseph had already made plans for a party of four and did not include Dobbin in their plans. Secondly, when Dobbin paraded twice before their box, nobody took any notice of him, which could suggest that he was not wanted or invited. Additionally, the passage implies that Rebecca and Joseph were more interested in each other's company, and Dobbin was not considered a part of their &quot;mated pairs&quot; group.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is possible that Dobbin may have sensed that he was not wanted or invited, as he does not attempt to join them and instead pays for the whole party to enter the Royal Gardens. He also seems content to give an arm to the shawls and walk behind the rest of the group, carrying a burden of shawls, indicating his unselfishness and willingness to prioritize others' happiness over his own.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the text does not provide explicit reasons for Dobbin's exclusion from the supper party, it suggests that he was not included in Rebecca and Joseph's plans, and they may have been more interested in spending time alone together. Dobbin, being a kind and selfless person, takes pleasure in seeing others enjoy themselves, even if he himself does not partake in the fun." />
    <node id="Based on the Sedley family's reactions and Rebecca's growing closeness with Jos, it seems that everything is indicating a positive outlook for Rebecca's fortunes. Mr. Sedley, although initially expressing some reservations about Rebecca's fortune, ultimately leaves the decision to his son and does not explicitly object to the match. The shift in Mrs. Sedley's attitude, from initial reluctance to support for the match, is another positive sign. Amelia's full support for the marriage also plays a significant role, as a close family member.&#10;&#10;The understanding of those around Rebecca and Jos suggests collective acceptance of the upcoming marriage, further strengthening this implication. Additionally, although not explicitly stated, the narrative implies that Amelia's parents have acquiesced to the arrangement, which indicates parental consent. All these factors suggest that Rebecca's marital prospects with Jos are promising. However, the narrative takes a turn when Jos ultimately decides not to marry Rebecca, which deeply upsets Amelia and relieves her parents." />
    <node id="Captain Dobbin does not have any specific plans regarding his romantic interest in Amelia Sedley. He has been developing feelings for her, as evidenced by his attention to her singing voice and appearance at Vauxhall Gardens. However, he does not take any active steps towards pursuing her during this outing.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, George Osborne also shows some signs of romantic interest in Amelia Sedley. He feels a manly compunction for teasing Miss Sharp about his affections for Amelia, which may indicate that he recognizes Dobbin as a potential rival for her affection. However, like Captain Dobbin, George does not make any specific moves towards advancing his romantic interest in Amelia during this episode.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca Sharp, neither Captain Dobbin nor George Osborne has explicit plans regarding her. Captain Dobbin indirectly helps prevent Jos Sedley from proposing to Rebecca by diverting his attention to Lambeth Palace. However, this action is more likely motivated by his concern for his friend's happiness rather than any romantic interest in Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Overall, neither Captain Dobbin nor George Osborne make any significant moves towards advancing their romantic interests in Amelia Sedley and Rebecca Sharp during this episode, leaving their plans ambiguous and open-ended." />
    <node id="The front bedroom where Lady Crawley died is described as having a funereal and gloomy atmosphere. The solemn Tinker, who is leading Rebecca to this room, even gives off a vibe that suggests the presence of Lady Crawley's ghost due to her behavior and the ominous rushlight in her hand. Despite the eerie setting, Rebecca is full of energy as she curiously explores the huge wardrobes, closets, cupboards, and drawers, while also examining the dreary pictures and toilette appointments.&#10;&#10;The old charwoman named Tinker attempts to create a religious deterrent by implying that she wouldn't feel comfortable sleeping in the bed without a good conscience. Rebecca responds with a lighthearted remark, indicating her lack of concern about the room's history. Instead, she asks the old woman to tell her all about Lady Crawley and Sir Pitt Crawley, hoping to learn more about her new surroundings and the people connected to this place. However, Tinker doesn't provide any useful information as she quickly goes to sleep, leaving Rebecca alone with her thoughts and anticipation for the next day.&#10;&#10;In summary, the front bedroom where Lady Crawley died has a somber and gloomy atmosphere that is emphasized by the charwoman's warning about the importance of having a good conscience when sleeping there. Despite this ominous setting, Rebecca shows great interest in her new surroundings while exploring the room with curiosity, waiting for the opportunity to learn more about her new life as a governess in this family of genteel connections." />
    <node id="'s a big bed, and there's room for two. Lady&#10;Crawley died in it.  Good night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt went off after this benediction, and the solemn Tinker,&#10;rushlight in hand, led the way up the great bleak stone stairs, past&#10;the great dreary drawing-room doors, with the handles muffled up in&#10;paper, into the great front bedroom, where Lady Crawley had slept her&#10;last.  The bed and chamber were so funereal and gloomy, you might have&#10;fancied, not only that Lady Crawley died in the room, but that her&#10;ghost inhabited it.  Rebecca sprang about the apartment, however, with&#10;the greatest liveliness, and had peeped into the huge wardrobes, and&#10;the closets, and the cupboards, and tried the drawers which were&#10;locked, and examined the dreary pictures and toilette appointments,&#10;while the old charwoman was saying her prayers.  &quot;I shouldn't like to&#10;sleep in this yeer bed without a good conscience, Miss,&quot; said the old&#10;woman.  &quot;There's room for us and a half-dozen of ghosts in it,&quot; says&#10;Rebecca" />
    <node id="1. Jos Sedley's Doubts: The narrative does not explicitly state the reasons for Jos's hesitation, but he sighs heavily and turns away whenever the subject of marrying Rebecca comes up. This behavior suggests that Jos has some doubts or reservations about the marriage, which he has not yet revealed to anyone.&#10;&#10;2. Financial Security: Unlike in Grosvenor Square, where wealth and status are assumed, the Sedley family is more concerned with financial security. Mr. Sedley initially expresses reservations about Rebecca's fortune, but later becomes neutral when he realizes that she will keep Jos in order, perhaps. Amelia's parents also feel relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with Rebecca due to her lack of fortune.&#10;&#10;3. Class Differences: The Sedley family is portrayed as being between the high-class Grosvenor Square and the low-class setting. They are not as wealthy or prestigious as those in Grosvenor Square, but they are also not as low-class as Mr. S., who was a stock-broker's clerk. This social position influences their approach to relationships, as they are more concerned with financial security than those in Grosvenor Square, but less focused on wealth and status than the high-class families.&#10;&#10;4. Rebecca's Character: Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision. She is described as good-humored and clever, which initially impresses Mr. Sedley. However, her lack of fortune and the fact that none of the servants in the household liked her ultimately contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jos Sedley's decision on whether to marry Rebecca is influenced by his own doubts or reservations, as well as the financial security and class differences that are more pronounced in the Sedley family compared to those in Grosvenor Square or a lower-class setting. Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision, as her lack of fortune and unpopularity among the servants contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when the relationship ends." />
    <node id="In the narrative, there is no explicit conversation between Mr. Jos Sedley and the Misses Sharp and Amelia regarding military honors or their experiences at the dinner. However, there is a mention of Mr. Jos Sedley's behavior during the outing to Vauxhall Gardens.&#10;&#10;Mr. Jos Sedley, who had been expecting to propose to Rebecca Sharp, gets diverted by Captain Dobbin, who takes him to Lambeth Palace instead. This action prevents Jos from proposing to Rebecca that night, and it can be inferred that this behavior is significant because it indirectly affects Rebecca's plans to marry Jos.&#10;&#10;As for the Misses Sharp and Sedley's reactions during their conversation about military honors and experiences at the dinner, the narrative only mentions that Miss Amelia and Miss Sharp are eagerly watching for the arrival of Mr. Joseph Sedley and Lieutenant George Osborne due to their romantic interest in them. There is no further information provided about their behavior or reactions during the dinner.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while there is some significant behavior displayed by Mr. Jos Sedley regarding his plans to propose to Rebecca Sharp, there is no explicit mention of any specific behavior during a conversation about military honors or their experiences at the dinner involving the Misses Sharp and Sedley." />

This social position influences their approach to relationships, as they are more concerned with financial security than those in Grosvenor Square, but less focused on wealth and status than the high-class families.&#10;&#10;4.

Amelia, who is present during this conversation, is the same girl that George had mentioned should marry him years ago when he saw her in a pink frock, indicating his interest in her. The narrator also notes how Amelia's singing voice and blooming appearance capture Captain Dobbin's attention, hinting at a possible love triangle involving Osborne, Amelia, and Dobbin.">

That" target="-------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;Captain Dobbin was likely excluded from joining the supper party with Rebecca and Joseph due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the text states that covers were laid for four, indicating that Rebecca and Joseph had already made plans for a party of four and did not include Dobbin in their plans. Secondly, when Dobbin paraded twice before their box, nobody took any notice of him, which could suggest that he was not wanted or invited. Additionally, the passage implies that Rebecca and Joseph were more interested in each other's company, and Dobbin was not considered a part of their &quot;mated pairs&quot; group.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is possible that Dobbin may have sensed that he was not wanted or invited, as he does not attempt to join them and instead pays for the whole party to enter the Royal Gardens. He also seems content to give an arm to the shawls and walk behind the rest of the group, carrying a burden of shawls, indicating his unselfishness and willingness to prioritize others' happiness over his own.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the text does not provide explicit reasons for Dobbin's exclusion from the supper party, it suggests that he was not included in Rebecca and Joseph's plans, and they may have been more interested in spending time alone together. Dobbin, being a kind and selfless person, takes pleasure in seeing others enjoy themselves, even if he himself does not partake in the fun.">

The reason for his exclusion is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that it is because Rebecca and Joseph are more interested in each other's company, and Dobbin is not considered a part of their &quot;mated pairs&quot; group. Furthermore, it could also be possible that they might have thought that an extra person would make them uncomfortable or unwanted. The text does not provide enough information to know for certain the reason for his exclusion.">

Firstly, the text states that covers were laid for four, indicating that Rebecca and Joseph had already made plans for a party of four and did not include Dobbin in their plans. Secondly, when Dobbin paraded twice before their box, nobody took any notice of him, which could suggest that he was not wanted or invited. Additionally, the passage implies that Rebecca and Joseph were more interested in each other's company, and Dobbin was not considered a part of their &quot;mated pairs&quot; group.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is possible that Dobbin may have sensed that he was not wanted or invited, as he does not attempt to join them and instead pays for the whole party to enter the Royal Gardens. He also seems content to give an arm to the shawls and walk behind the rest of the group, carrying a burden of shawls, indicating his unselfishness and willingness to prioritize others' happiness over his own.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the text does not provide explicit reasons for Dobbin's exclusion from the supper party, it suggests that he was not included in Rebecca and Joseph's plans, and they may have been more interested in spending time alone together. Dobbin, being a kind and selfless person, takes pleasure in seeing others enjoy themselves, even if he himself does not partake in the fun.">

Jos Sedley's Doubts: The narrative does not explicitly state the reasons for Jos's hesitation, but he sighs heavily and turns away whenever the subject of marrying Rebecca comes up. This behavior suggests that Jos has some doubts or reservations about the marriage, which he has not yet revealed to anyone.&#10;&#10;2.

Mr. Sedley initially expresses reservations about Rebecca's fortune, but later becomes neutral when he realizes that she will keep Jos in order, perhaps. Amelia's parents also feel relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with Rebecca due to her lack of fortune.&#10;&#10;3. Class Differences: The Sedley family is portrayed as being between the high-class Grosvenor Square and the low-class setting. They are not as wealthy or prestigious as those in Grosvenor Square, but they are also not as low-class as Mr. S., who was a stock-broker's clerk. This social position influences their approach to relationships, as they are more concerned with financial security than those in Grosvenor Square, but less focused on wealth and status than the high-class families.&#10;&#10;4. Rebecca's Character: Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision. She is described as good-humored and clever, which initially impresses Mr. Sedley. However, her lack of fortune and the fact that none of the servants in the household liked her ultimately contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jos Sedley's decision on whether to marry Rebecca is influenced by his own doubts or reservations, as well as the financial security and class differences that are more pronounced in the Sedley family compared to those in Grosvenor Square or a lower-class setting. Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision, as her lack of fortune and unpopularity among the servants contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when the relationship ends.">

Jos Sedley's Doubts: The narrative does not explicitly state the reasons for Jos's hesitation, but he sighs heavily and turns away whenever the subject of marrying Rebecca comes up. This behavior suggests that Jos has some doubts or reservations about the marriage, which he has not yet revealed to anyone.&#10;&#10;2.

Mr. Sedley initially expresses reservations about Rebecca's fortune, but later becomes neutral when he realizes that she will keep Jos in order, perhaps. Amelia's parents also feel relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with Rebecca due to her lack of fortune.&#10;&#10;3. Class Differences: The Sedley family is portrayed as being between the high-class Grosvenor Square and the low-class setting. They are not as wealthy or prestigious as those in Grosvenor Square, but they are also not as low-class as Mr. S., who was a stock-broker's clerk. This social position influences their approach to relationships, as they are more concerned with financial security than those in Grosvenor Square, but less focused on wealth and status than the high-class families.&#10;&#10;4. Rebecca's Character: Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision. She is described as good-humored and clever, which initially impresses Mr. Sedley. However, her lack of fortune and the fact that none of the servants in the household liked her ultimately contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jos Sedley's decision on whether to marry Rebecca is influenced by his own doubts or reservations, as well as the financial security and class differences that are more pronounced in the Sedley family compared to those in Grosvenor Square or a lower-class setting. Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision, as her lack of fortune and unpopularity among the servants contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when the relationship ends.">

In his letter, he also asked Amelia to convey his apologies and request forgiveness from Rebecca regarding his behavior that night. The letter was essentially a break-off communication, informing Amelia of his immediate departure for Cheltenham, followed by a trip to Scotland for his health.&#10;&#10;Amelia was deeply saddened and upset by the news, as she suspected Jos would propose to Rebecca at Vauxhall Gardens. She couldn't bear to look at Rebecca after reading the letter and immediately went upstairs to her room in tears. The housekeeper, Blenkinsop, came to comfort Amelia, sharing that none of the servants liked Rebecca when she worked there as a governess.&#10;&#10;Amelia's parents were also relieved by this decision, having never considered Rebecca a suitable match for their son due to her lack of fortune. Mr. Sedley, initially neutral about the match, agreed it was best not to marry &quot;a black Mrs. Sedley&quot; and have &quot;a dozen mahogany grandchildren.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rebecca had been under the impression that Jos would propose at Vauxhall Gardens; however, Captain Dobbin diverted his attention by taking him to Lambeth Palace, ensuring he wouldn't propose to Rebecca that night. The plan was successful, and Jos never made a formal proposal to Rebecca.&#10;&#10;In summary, Amelia was deeply saddened by the news of Jos breaking off his relationship with Rebecca, while her parents were relieved as they had not considered Rebecca a suitable match for their son.

Rebecca's curiosity about the appearance and status of a Baronet, such as wondering if they wear a star or other insignia, reflects her eagerness to learn more about the social standing and expectations of the family she is about to join. As a governess coming from a humble background, she is aware that she will be moving in a &quot;much more distinguished circle&quot; than she is used to. Her musings demonstrate her desire to fit in and make a good impression in her new environment.&#10;2.

She wants to understand the potential challenges and opportunities that come with this new position, as well as how she should conduct herself around such an individual.&#10;3. Rebecca's reflections on her new role as a governess and what it entails are intertwined with her curiosity about the Baronet, Sir Pitt Crawley.

All these factors suggest that Rebecca's marital prospects with Jos are promising. However, the narrative takes a turn when Jos ultimately decides not to marry Rebecca, which deeply upsets Amelia and relieves her parents." target="1. Jos Sedley's Doubts: The narrative does not explicitly state the reasons for Jos's hesitation, but he sighs heavily and turns away whenever the subject of marrying Rebecca comes up. This behavior suggests that Jos has some doubts or reservations about the marriage, which he has not yet revealed to anyone.&#10;&#10;2. Financial Security: Unlike in Grosvenor Square, where wealth and status are assumed, the Sedley family is more concerned with financial security. Mr. Sedley initially expresses reservations about Rebecca's fortune, but later becomes neutral when he realizes that she will keep Jos in order, perhaps. Amelia's parents also feel relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with Rebecca due to her lack of fortune.&#10;&#10;3. Class Differences: The Sedley family is portrayed as being between the high-class Grosvenor Square and the low-class setting. They are not as wealthy or prestigious as those in Grosvenor Square, but they are also not as low-class as Mr. S., who was a stock-broker's clerk. This social position influences their approach to relationships, as they are more concerned with financial security than those in Grosvenor Square, but less focused on wealth and status than the high-class families.&#10;&#10;4. Rebecca's Character: Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision. She is described as good-humored and clever, which initially impresses Mr. Sedley. However, her lack of fortune and the fact that none of the servants in the household liked her ultimately contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when Jos breaks off his relationship with her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jos Sedley's decision on whether to marry Rebecca is influenced by his own doubts or reservations, as well as the financial security and class differences that are more pronounced in the Sedley family compared to those in Grosvenor Square or a lower-class setting. Rebecca's character also plays a role in Jos's decision, as her lack of fortune and unpopularity among the servants contribute to Amelia's parents feeling relieved when the relationship ends.">

However, like Captain Dobbin, George does not make any specific moves towards advancing his romantic interest in Amelia during this episode.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca Sharp, neither Captain Dobbin nor George Osborne has explicit plans regarding her. Captain Dobbin indirectly helps prevent Jos Sedley from proposing to Rebecca by diverting his attention to Lambeth Palace. However, this action is more likely motivated by his concern for his friend's happiness rather than any romantic interest in Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Overall, neither Captain Dobbin nor George Osborne make any significant moves towards advancing their romantic interests in Amelia Sedley and Rebecca Sharp during this episode, leaving their plans ambiguous and open-ended." target="In the narrative, there is no explicit conversation between Mr. Jos Sedley and the Misses Sharp and Amelia regarding military honors or their experiences at the dinner.

    <node id="The unnamed protagonist, referred to as Clifford, sees Phoebe as a source of comfort and happiness in his bleak and dismal life. Despite her lack of intellectual sophistication and poetic sensibilities, he appreciates her simplicity, beauty, and charm. She is his only connection to the world of women, and serves as a symbol of all that he has missed out on in his life. Her presence brings warmth and life back into the old Pyncheon House, which had been filled with gloom and shadows before her arrival.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that Phoebe is not just a source of comfort for Clifford, but also a means of escape from his own troubled mind. Her simple nature and wholesomeness help to distract him from the riddles and mysteries surrounding his own character and past. Through her presence, he is able to forget about the wrongs done to him by the world and find a sense of peace.&#10;&#10;Despite not being a real person in Clifford's life, Phoebe has a profound impact on him because she represents all that he lacks and longs for. She serves as a reminder of what could have been and brings a sense of warmth and life back into his world. Her simple nature and wholesomeness also provide a much-needed escape from the complexities and troubles of his own mind." />

Indeed, there was something too fine and delicate in&#10;    Clifford's traits to be perfectly appreciated by one whose sphere lay&#10;    so much in the Actual as Phoebe's did.  For Clifford, however, the&#10;    reality, and simplicity, and thorough homeliness of the girl's nature&#10;    were as powerful a charm as any that she possessed.  Beauty, it is&#10;    true, and beauty almost perfect in its own style, was indispensable.&#10;    Had Phoebe been coarse in feature, shaped clumsily, of a harsh voice,&#10;    and uncouthly mannered, she might have been rich with all good gifts,&#10;    beneath this unfortunate exterior, and still, so long as she wore the&#10;    guise of woman, she would have shocked Clifford, and depressed him by&#10;    her lack of beauty.  But nothing more beautiful--nothing prettier, at&#10;    least--was ever made than Phoebe.  And, therefore, to this man,--whose&#10;    whole poor and impalpable enjoyment of existence heretofore," />
    <node id="?  Because,&#10;    probably, at his highest elevation, the poet needs no human&#10;    intercourse; but he finds it dreary to descend, and be a stranger.&#10;&#10;    There was something very beautiful in the relation that grew up between&#10;    this pair, so closely and constantly linked together, yet with such a&#10;    waste of gloomy and mysterious years from his birthday to hers.  On&#10;    Clifford's part it was the feeling of a man naturally endowed with the&#10;    liveliest sensibility to feminine influence, but who had never quaffed&#10;    the cup of passionate love, and knew that it was now too late.  He knew&#10;    it, with the instinctive delicacy that had survived his intellectual&#10;    decay.  Thus, his sentiment for Phoebe, without being paternal, was not&#10;    less chaste than if she had been his daughter.  He was a man, it is&#10;    true, and recognized her as a woman.  She was his only representative&#10;    of womankind.  He took unfailing note of every charm that appertained&#10; " />
    <node id=" Phoebe as he would a sweet and simple story; he listened to her as&#10;    if she were a verse of household poetry, which God, in requital of his&#10;    bleak and dismal lot, had permitted some angel, that most pitied him,&#10;    to warble through the house.  She was not an actual fact for him, but&#10;    the interpretation of all that he lacked on earth brought warmly home&#10;    to his conception; so that this mere symbol, or life-like picture, had&#10;    almost the comfort of reality.&#10;&#10;    But we strive in vain to put the idea into words.  No adequate&#10;    expression of the beauty and profound pathos with which it impresses us&#10;    is attainable.  This being, made only for happiness, and heretofore so&#10;    miserably failing to be happy,--his tendencies so hideously thwarted,&#10;    that, some unknown time ago, the delicate springs of his character,&#10;    never morally or intellectually strong, had given way, and he was now&#10;    imbecile,--this poor, forl" />

Not that he could&#10;    ever be said to converse with her, or often manifest, in any other very&#10;    definite mode, his sense of a charm in her society. But if she were a&#10;    long while absent he became pettish and nervously restless, pacing the&#10;    room to and fro with the uncertainty that characterized all his&#10;    movements; or else would sit broodingly in his great chair, resting his&#10;    head on his hands, and evincing life only by an electric sparkle of&#10;    ill-humor, whenever Hepzibah endeavored to arouse him.

Phoebe loved no riddles, and&#10;         would have been glad to escape the perplexity of this one.&#10;         Nevertheless, there was so far a good result of her meditations on&#10;         Clifford's character, that, when her involuntary conjectures, together&#10;         with the tendency of every strange circumstance to tell its own story,&#10;         had gradually taught her the fact, it had no terrible effect upon her.&#10;         Let the world have done him what vast wrong it might, she knew Cousin&#10;         Clifford too well--or fancied so--ever to shudder at the touch of his&#10;         thin, delicate fingers.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="ables seemed to have vanished since her appearance there;&#10;    the gnawing tooth of the dry-rot was stayed among the old timbers of&#10;    its skeleton frame; the dust had ceased to settle down so densely, from&#10;    the antique ceilings, upon the floors and furniture of the rooms&#10;    below,--or, at any rate, there was a little housewife, as light-footed&#10;    as the breeze that sweeps a garden walk, gliding hither and thither to&#10;    brush it all away.  The shadows of gloomy events that haunted the else&#10;    lonely and desolate apartments; the heavy, breathless scent which death&#10;    had left in more than one of the bedchambers, ever since his visits of&#10;    long ago,--these were less powerful than the purifying influence&#10;    scattered throughout the atmosphere of the household by the presence of&#10;    one youthful, fresh, and thoroughly wholesome heart.  There was no&#10;    morbidness in Phoebe; if there had been, the old Pyncheon House was the&#10;    very locality to ripen it into incurable" />
    <node id="Phoebe's arrival had a significantly positive impact on Hepzibah and Clifford, the two inhabitants of the House of the Seven Gables. Her &quot;genial temperament&quot; and cheerful disposition helped to create a more comfortable and uplifting atmosphere in the house, which had previously been affected by gloominess and sordidness. The description of the house improving since her arrival suggests that Phoebe's presence brought about positive changes; the &quot;gnawing tooth of dry-rot&quot; was stayed among the old timbers, dust ceased to settle as heavily, and even the shadows of negative events seemed less powerful.&#10;&#10;Phoebe's influence extended beyond the physical environment. Her adaptability and ability to sympathize with various emotions allowed her to provide emotional support to both Hepzibah and Clifford. She helped alleviate Hepzibah's anxiety, and for Clifford, who had spent his life learning how to be wretched, Phoebe's presence was like a breath of fresh air. Her simple and wholesome nature, as well as her physical beauty, provided him with an enjoyable contrast to the dreariness he had known throughout his life.&#10;&#10;In summary, Phoebe's arrival brought about positive changes in the House of the Seven Gables by uplifting the atmosphere and providing emotional support to its inhabitants, Hepzibah and Clifford." />

Had it&#10;    pleased Heaven to crown the heroic fidelity of her life by making her&#10;    personally the medium of Clifford's happiness, it would have rewarded&#10;    her for all the past, by a joy with no bright tints, indeed, but deep&#10;    and true, and worth a thousand gayer ecstasies.  This could not be.&#10;    She therefore turned to Phoebe, and resigned the task into the young&#10;    girl's hands.  The latter took it up cheerfully, as she did everything,&#10;    but with no sense of a mission to perform, and succeeding all the&#10;    better for that same simplicity.&#10;&#10;    By the involuntary effect of a genial temperament, Phoebe soon grew to&#10;    be absolutely essential to the daily comfort, if not the daily life, of&#10;    her two forlorn companions.  The grime and sordidness of the House of&#10;    the Seven Gables seemed to have vanished since her appearance there;&#10;    the gnawing tooth of the dry-rot was stayed among the old timbers of" />

This facile&#10;    adaptation was at once the symptom of perfect health and its best&#10;    preservative.&#10;&#10;    A nature like Phoebe's has invariably its due influence, but is seldom&#10;    regarded with due honor.  Its spiritual force, however, may be&#10;    partially estimated by the fact of her having found a place for&#10;    herself, amid circumstances so stern as those which surrounded the&#10;    mistress of the house; and also by the effect which she produced on a&#10;    character of so much more mass than her own.

All his life long, he had been learning how to&#10;         be wretched, as one learns a foreign tongue; and now, with the lesson&#10;         thoroughly by heart, he could with difficulty comprehend his little&#10;         airy happiness.  Frequently there was a dim shadow of doubt in his&#10;         eyes.  &quot;Take my hand, Phoebe,&quot; he would say, &quot;and pinch it hard with&#10;         your little fingers! Give me a rose, that I may press its thorns, and&#10;         prove myself awake by the sharp touch of pain!&quot;  Evidently, he desired&#10;         this prick of a trifling anguish, in order to assure himself, by that&#10;         quality which he best knew to be real, that the garden, and the seven&#10;         weather-beaten gables, and Hepzibah's scowl, and Phoebe's smile" />
    <node id=" seven&#10;         weather-beaten gables, and Hepzibah's scowl, and Phoebe's smile, were&#10;         real likewise.  Without this signet in his flesh, he could have&#10;         attributed no more substance to them than to the empty confusion of&#10;         imaginary scenes with which he had fed his spirit, until even that poor&#10;         sustenance was exhausted.&#10;&#10;         The author needs great faith in his reader's sympathy; else he must&#10;         hesitate to give details so minute, and incidents apparently so&#10;         trifling, as are essential to make up the idea of this garden-life.  It&#10;         was the Eden of a thunder-smitten Adam, who had fled for refuge thither&#10;         out of the same dreary and perilous wilderness into which the original&#10;         Adam was expelled.&#10;&#10;     " />
    <node id="Hepzibah encounters a difficulty while reading Rasselas to her brother Clifford as she struggles with innumerable sins of emphasis that Clifford seems to detect without reference to the meaning. He doesn't appear to take much note of the sense of what she reads, but rather feels the tedium of the lecture without harvesting its profit. The text suggests that this is because Clifford has lost his interest in modes and manners, which might have been engaging for him in his youth. Moreover, Hepzibah's naturally harsh voice has contracted a kind of croak due to her sorrowful lifetime, making the lecture even more tedious for Clifford. It seems that he derives little benefit from it because he is not focused on the content of the reading; instead, he might be preoccupied with his own thoughts and feelings." />

Hepzibah then took up Rasselas, and began to&#10;    read of the Happy Valley, with a vague idea that some secret of a&#10;    contented life had there been elaborated, which might at least serve&#10;    Clifford and herself for this one day.  But the Happy Valley had a&#10;    cloud over it.  Hepzibah troubled her auditor, moreover, by innumerable&#10;    sins of emphasis, which he seemed to detect, without any reference to&#10;    the meaning; nor, in fact, did he appear to take much note of the sense&#10;    of what she read, but evidently felt the tedium of the lecture, without&#10;    harvesting its profit.

And it was a wonderful coincidence, the good lady&#10;         thought, that the artist should have planted these scarlet-flowering&#10;         beans--which the humming-birds sought far and wide, and which had not&#10;         grown in the Pyncheon garden before for forty years--on the very summer&#10;         of Clifford's return.&#10;&#10;         Then would the tears stand in poor Hepzibah's eyes, or overflow them&#10;         with a too abundant gush, so that she was fain to betake herself into&#10;         some corner, lest Clifford should espy her agitation.  Indeed, all" />
    <node id=" them!&#10;&#10;    Discerning that Clifford was not gladdened by her efforts, Hepzibah&#10;    searched about the house for the means of more exhilarating pastime.&#10;    At one time, her eyes chanced to rest on Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord.&#10;    It was a moment of great peril; for,--despite the traditionary awe that&#10;    had gathered over this instrument of music, and the dirges which&#10;    spiritual fingers were said to play on it,--the devoted sister had&#10;    solemn thoughts of thrumming on its chords for Clifford's benefit, and&#10;    accompanying the performance with her voice.  Poor Clifford! Poor&#10;    Hepzibah! Poor harpsichord! All three would have been miserable&#10;    together.  By some good agency,--possibly, by the unrecognized&#10;    interposition of the long-buried Alice herself,--the threatening&#10;    calamity was averted.&#10;&#10;    But the worst of all--the hardest stroke of fate for Hepzibah to&#10;    endure, and perhaps for Clifford" />
    <node id=" Had Clifford&#10;     attained the balcony, he would probably have leaped into the street;&#10;     but whether impelled by the species of terror that sometimes urges its&#10;     victim over the very precipice which he shrinks from, or by a natural&#10;     magnetism, tending towards the great centre of humanity, it were not&#10;     easy to decide.  Both impulses might have wrought on him at once.&#10;&#10;     But his companions, affrighted by his gesture,--which was that of a man&#10;     hurried away in spite of himself,--seized Clifford's garment and held&#10;     him back.  Hepzibah shrieked.  Phoebe, to whom all extravagance was a&#10;     horror, burst into sobs and tears.&#10;&#10;     &quot;Clifford, Clifford! are you crazy?&quot; cried his sister.&#10;&#10;     &quot;I hardly know, Hepzibah,&quot; said Clifford, drawing a long breath.  &quot;Fear&#10;     nothing,--it is over now,--but had I taken that plunge, and survived&#10; " />
    <node id="        indescribable interest, and even more than childish delight, that&#10;         Clifford watched the humming-birds.   He used to thrust his head softly&#10;         out of the arbor to see them the better; all the while, too, motioning&#10;         Phoebe to be quiet, and snatching glimpses of the smile upon her face,&#10;         so as to heap his enjoyment up the higher with her sympathy.  He had&#10;         not merely grown young;--he was a child again.&#10;&#10;         Hepzibah, whenever she happened to witness one of these fits of&#10;         miniature enthusiasm, would shake her head, with a strange mingling of&#10;         the mother and sister, and of pleasure and sadness, in her aspect.

    <node id="In the narrative, Hepzibah plays a significant role in providing support for her brother Clifford during his time of need. She tries to engage him with reading materials like Rasselas, but when she realizes that it doesn't bring him joy, she searches for more exhilarating pastimes. When she considers playing the harpsichord, despite its associated solemnity and tradition, her good sense or perhaps the intervention of Alice Pyncheon prevents this from happening.&#10;&#10;Hepzibah's care and concern for Clifford are evident when Phoebe is introduced as his nursemaid; however, Clifford becomes restless without Phoebe's presence, highlighting Hepzibah's inability to fully comfort him on her own. Despite this realization, Hepzibah remains devoted to her brother and seeks to alleviate his suffering through her affectionate companionship.&#10;&#10;The sight of Hepzibah's tearful devotion reveals several aspects of her character. She is a faithful sister who has dedicated herself to caring for Clifford after their family's misfortunes and long-term separation. Hepzibah's scowl, which could be considered sad perversity, may hide an underlying grief or anxiety about Clifford's well-being. Despite her disadvantages of person and clumsy demeanor, she is ready to do everything in her power to help him, demonstrating her deep love and selflessness." />

She was a grief&#10;    to Clifford, and she knew it.  In this extremity, the antiquated virgin&#10;    turned to Phoebe.  No grovelling jealousy was in her heart.

She had responded to the call.

In compliance with a whim of Clifford, as it troubled&#10;         him to see them in confinement, they had been set at liberty, and now&#10;         roamed at will about the garden; doing some little mischief, but&#10;         hindered from escape by buildings on three sides, and the difficult&#10;         peaks of a wooden fence on the other.  They spent much of their&#10;         abundant leisure on the margin of Maule's well, which was haunted by a&#10;      " />

She takes care of him when Hepzibah is attending to the shop, serving as his guardian, nurse, and playmate. Phoebe's presence significantly affects Clifford's demeanor, as he finds great charm in her reality, simplicity, and thorough homeliness. Her beauty is also essential to him, as he has a strong appreciation for aesthetics. Clifford enjoys Phoebe's company and the topics she brings up during their conversations, particularly focusing on flowers and the garden. He even seems to develop an emotional connection with the flowers she talks about, comparing them to Phoebe herself." />

It was now the&#10;         young girl's turn to be the nurse,--the guardian, the playmate,--or&#10;         whatever is the fitter phrase,--of the gray-haired man.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CLIFFORD, except for Phoebe's More active instigation would ordinarily&#10;have yielded to the torpor which had crept through all his modes of&#10;" />

In the morning, very shortly after&#10;         breakfast, it was Clifford's custom to fall asleep in his chair; nor,&#10;         unless accidentally disturbed, would he emerge from a dense cloud of&#10;         slumber or the thinner mists that flitted to and fro, until well&#10;         towards noonday.

Such a flower was Phoebe in her relation with&#10;         Clifford, and such the delight that he inhaled from her.&#10;&#10;         Yet, it must be said, her petals sometimes drooped a little, in&#10;         consequence of the heavy atmosphere about her.  She grew more&#10;         thoughtful than heretofore.  Looking aside at Clifford's face, and&#10;         seeing the dim, unsatisfactory elegance and the intellect almost&#10;         quenched, she would try to inquire what had been his life.  Was he&#10;         always thus? Had this veil been over him from his birth?--this veil,&#10;         under which far more of his spirit was hidden than revealed, and&#10;       " />

The life of the garden offered&#10;         topics enough for such discourse as suited Clifford best.  He never&#10;         failed to inquire what flowers had bloomed since yesterday.  His&#10;         feeling for flowers was very exquisite, and seemed not so much a taste&#10;         as an emotion; he was fond of sitting with one in his hand, intently&#10;         observing it, and looking from its petals into Phoebe's face, as if the&#10;         garden flower were the sister of the household maiden.

    <node id="In the narrative provided, it is mentioned that Clifford experienced a significant emotional realization on a bright and calm Sabbath morning. This specific moment was when he acknowledged God's care and love towards him despite feeling abandoned and at the mercy of some malevolent force. Although more details about the circumstances leading up to this recognition are not explicitly provided, it is evident that this newfound awareness brought Clifford comfort and made him feel less lonely in his struggles.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights how Clifford once was, describing him as a man who might have seen himself as forsaken and at the whim of an evil force. The Sabbath atmosphere, with its serenity and a sense of divine presence, likely contributed to Clifford's emotional breakthrough and realization of God's love for him.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that this touching recognition is mentioned in passing while discussing other aspects of Clifford's character. As such, the narrative does not elaborate further on Clifford's relationship with religion or how profoundly this moment affected his life moving forward. Nevertheless, it serves as a significant turning point for Clifford and highlights the power of faith and recognition of divine support during challenging times." />
    <node id=" incident now to be sketched, there was a touching recognition, on&#10;     Clifford's part, of God's care and love towards him,--towards this&#10;     poor, forsaken man, who, if any mortal could, might have been pardoned&#10;     for regarding himself as thrown aside, forgotten, and left to be the&#10;     sport of some fiend, whose playfulness was an ecstasy of mischief.&#10;&#10;     It was the Sabbath morning; one of those bright, calm Sabbaths, with&#10;     its own hallowed atmosphere, when Heaven seems to diffuse itself over&#10;     the earth's face in a solemn smile, no less sweet than solemn.  On such&#10;     a Sabbath morn, were we pure enough to be its medium, we should be&#10;     conscious of the earth's natural worship ascending through our frames,&#10;     on whatever spot of ground we stood.

He needed a&#10;     shock; or perhaps he required to take a deep, deep plunge into the&#10;     ocean of human life, and to sink down and be covered by its&#10;     profoundness, and then to emerge, sobered, invigorated, restored to the&#10;     world and to himself.  Perhaps again, he required nothing less than the&#10;     great final remedy--death!&#10;&#10;     A similar yearning to renew the broken links of brotherhood with his&#10;     kind sometimes showed itself in a milder form; and once it was made&#10;     beautiful by the religion that lay even deeper than itself.  In the&#10;     incident now to be sketched, there was a touching recognition, on&#10;     Clifford's part, of God's care and love towards him," />
    <node id=", as a mark of friendship and&#10;approbation, he readily consented to afford the young man his&#10;countenance in the way of his profession,--not metaphorically, be it&#10;understood, but literally, by allowing a daguerreotype of his face, so&#10;familiar to the town, to be exhibited at the entrance of Holgrave's&#10;studio.&#10;&#10;Clifford, as the company partook of their little banquet, grew to be&#10;the gayest of them all.  Either it was one of those up-quivering&#10;flashes of the spirit, to which minds in an abnormal state are liable,&#10;        or else the artist had subtly touched some chord that made musical&#10;        vibration.  Indeed, what with the pleasant summer evening, and the&#10;        sympathy of this little circle of not unkindly souls, it was perhaps&#10;        natural that a character so susceptible as Clifford's should become&#10;        animated, and show itself readily responsive to what was said around&#10;        him.  But he gave out his own" />
    <node id="emotions could withstand.  When Phoebe broke into a peal of merry&#10;laughter at what she read, he would now and then laugh for sympathy,&#10;         but oftener respond with a troubled, questioning look.  If a tear--a&#10;         maiden's sunshiny tear over imaginary woe--dropped upon some melancholy&#10;         page, Clifford either took it as a token of actual calamity, or else&#10;         grew peevish, and angrily motioned her to close the volume.  And wisely&#10;         too! Is not the world sad enough, in genuine earnest, without making a&#10;         pastime of mock sorrows?&#10;&#10;         With poetry it was rather better.  He delighted in the swell and&#10;         subsidence of the rhythm, and the happily recurring rhyme.  Nor was&#10;         Clifford incapable of feeling the sentiment of poetry,--not, perhaps,&#10;       " />

Had&#10;     Clifford, every time that he emerged out of dreams so lifelike,&#10;     undergone the torture of transformation from a boy into an old and&#10;     broken man, the daily recurrence of the shock would have been too much&#10;     to bear.  It would have caused an acute agony to thrill from the&#10;     morning twilight, all the day through, until bedtime; and even then&#10;     would have mingled a dull, inscrutable pain and pallid hue of&#10;     misfortune with the visionary bloom and adolescence of his slumber.&#10;     But the nightly moonshine interwove itself with the morning mist, and&#10;     enveloped him as in a robe, which he hugged about his person, and&#10;     seldom let realities pierce through; he was not often quite awake, but&#10;     slept open-eyed, and perhaps fancied himself most dreaming then.&#10;&#10;     Thus, lingering always so near his childhood, he had sympathies with&#10;     children," />
    <node id=" was&#10;         Clifford incapable of feeling the sentiment of poetry,--not, perhaps,&#10;         where it was highest or deepest, but where it was most flitting and&#10;         ethereal.  It was impossible to foretell in what exquisite verse the&#10;         awakening spell might lurk; but, on raising her eyes from the page to&#10;         Clifford's face, Phoebe would be made aware, by the light breaking&#10;         through it, that a more delicate intelligence than her own had caught a&#10;         lambent flame from what she read.  One glow of this kind, however, was&#10;         often the precursor of gloom for many hours afterward; because, when&#10;         the glow left him, he seemed conscious of a missing sense and power,&#10;         and groped about for them, as if a blind man should go seeking his lost&#10;         eyesight." />

A great many put out their fingers&#10;     or their walking-sticks to touch, withal; and were perversely&#10;     gratified, no doubt, when the bubble, with all its pictured earth and&#10;     sky scene, vanished as if it had never been.&#10;&#10;     At length, just as an elderly gentleman of very dignified presence&#10;     happened to be passing, a large bubble sailed majestically down, and&#10;     burst right against his nose!

His mind took an apparently&#10;     sharp impression from it, but lost the recollection of this&#10;     perambulatory shower, before its next reappearance, as completely as&#10;     did the street itself, along which the heat so quickly strewed white&#10;     dust again.  It was the same with the railroad.  Clifford could hear&#10;     the obstreperous howl of the steam-devil, and, by leaning a little way&#10;     from the arched window, could catch a glimpse of the trains of cars,&#10;     flashing a brief transit across the extremity of the street.

He suggests that for the short duration of human life, one need not worry too much about having a house and garden of one's own, as there is plenty of space for all in the grand scheme of things. The daguerreotypist then relates Uncle Venner's perspective to the principles of Fourier, a French philosopher known for his ideas on social reform and harmonious association. Fourier proposed that individuals would be happiest if they lived and worked together in small, self-sufficient communities called phalansteries, sharing resources and collaborating on tasks. This idea of shared resources and community living aligns with Uncle Venner's perspective on the sufficiency of the infinite and eternal for human needs and desires." />

This affection and&#10;         sympathy for flowers is almost exclusively a woman's trait.

    <node id="The second wife of Chanticleer being unable to lay an egg symbolizes the barrenness or lack of productivity within the Pyncheon family. This is because, as stated in the supporting materials, the chicken and its eggs are an &quot;immemorial heirloom&quot; in the family and embody their tradition and history. The chicken's despondency and inability to lay an egg could represent the oddities of the Pyncheon family and their struggles. However, when the second wife of Chanticleer finally lays an egg, it could symbolize a positive change or new beginning for the family. This event also highlights the significance of the chicken as a symbol of the Pyncheon family's history, as the egg she laid is a continuation of their lineage and tradition. Overall, the chicken and its eggs in this narrative are used to represent and explore the past, present, and future of the Pyncheon family." />
    <node id="The special value that the hen in the garden possesses is likely related to her ability to lay eggs. This is suggested by her self-importance and the reaction of Chanticleer and his family when Phoebe finds a small egg not in the regular nest. The hen's self-important behavior, such as her &quot;sideways turn of her head&quot; and &quot;cock of her eye,&quot; as well as her croaking to herself with &quot;inexpressible complacency,&quot; all indicate that she is aware of her value as an egg layer. This is further supported by the fact that the egg is hidden under the currant-bushes, rather than in the regular nest, indicating that it is a valuable and precious commodity. The reaction of Chanticleer and his family to the discovery of the egg also suggests its special value, as they all express &quot;prodigious cackling and gratulation&quot; upon finding it. Overall, the evidence points to the special value of the hen in the garden being directly related to her ability to lay eggs, with the small egg found by Phoebe representing a valuable and precious addition to the family's supply." />
    <node id="         afternoon Phoebe found a diminutive egg,--not in the regular nest, it&#10;         was far too precious to be trusted there,--but cunningly hidden under&#10;         the currant-bushes, on some dry stalks of last year's grass.  Hepzibah,&#10;         on learning the fact, took possession of the egg and appropriated it to&#10;         Clifford's breakfast, on account of a certain delicacy of flavor, for&#10;         which, as she affirmed, these eggs had always been famous.  Thus&#10;         unscrupulously did the old gentlewoman sacrifice the continuance,&#10;         perhaps, of an ancient feathered race, with no better end than to&#10;         supply her brother with a dainty that hardly filled the bowl of a&#10;         tea-spoon! It must have been in reference to this outrage that&#10;       " />
    <node id="The behavior and actions of the determined chicken in the garden suggest that she is very aware of her value as an egg layer. She is constantly scratching and digging for food, particularly earthworms, to ensure she is well-nourished and able to lay eggs. When she believes her egg is hidden or in danger, she makes loud noises to alert others and protect it. Her self-important behavior, such as her sideways turn of the head and cock of her eye, also indicate that she is proud of her ability to lay eggs and aware of her value to the family.&#10;&#10;The chicken's priorities are clearly centered around her ability to lay eggs, as evidenced by her aggressive pursuit of food and protection of her eggs. She is fearful of predators, such as the neighbor's cat, who may threaten her eggs or young chicks. Overall, the chicken's behavior and actions reveal that she is a determined and self-important creature who values her role as an egg layer above all else." />

This overwhelms him as he lacks the strong power of laughter to withstand such unpleasantness.&#10;&#10;Clause 2: When a political procession comes through Pyncheon Street, complete with hundreds of flaunting banners, drums, fifes, clarions, and cymbals, Clifford is drawn to look at it despite his initial repugnance towards personal contact with the world. This suggests that he has a deep longing for connection and excitement, despite his melancholy demeanor.&#10;&#10;In summary, Clifford's delicate endowments make him susceptible to shedding tears when confronted with ugliness, while his curiosity draws him towards the noise and spectacle of the political procession on Pyncheon Street." />
    <node id=" ugliness,&#10;     spiritual as well as physical, that he actually began to shed tears; a&#10;     weakness which men of merely delicate endowments, and destitute of the&#10;     fiercer, deeper, and more tragic power of laughter, can hardly avoid,&#10;     when the worst and meanest aspect of life happens to be presented to&#10;     them.&#10;&#10;     Pyncheon Street was sometimes enlivened by spectacles of more imposing&#10;     pretensions than the above, and which brought the multitude along with&#10;     them.  With a shivering repugnance at the idea of personal contact with&#10;     the world, a powerful impulse still seized on Clifford, whenever the&#10;     rush and roar of the human tide grew strongly audible to him.  This was&#10;     made evident, one day, when a political procession, with hundreds of&#10;     flaunting banners, and drums, fifes, clarions, and cymbals,&#10;     reverberating between the rows of buildings, marched all through town,&#10;   " />

Still blowing&#10;     soap-bubbles!&quot;&#10;&#10;     The tone seemed as if meant to be kind and soothing, but yet had a&#10;     bitterness of sarcasm in it.  As for Clifford, an absolute palsy of&#10;     fear came over him.  Apart from any definite cause of dread which his&#10;     past experience might have given him, he felt that native and original&#10;     horror of the excellent Judge which is proper to a weak, delicate, and&#10;     apprehensive character in the presence of massive strength.  Strength&#10;     is incomprehensible by weakness, and, therefore, the more terrible.&#10;     There is no greater bugbear than a strong-willed relative in the circle&#10;     of his own connections.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Hepzibah contemplates an unconventional measure to win her brother Clifford's affection: she thinks of adorning her turban with ribbons. This action is considered desperate because it deviates from her usual character and attempts to alter her appearance significantly, which she believes might appeal to Clifford. However, her instincts prevent her from carrying out this plan, understanding that such a change could potentially harm the object of her concern.&#10;&#10;Phoebe plays a vital role in this situation as she takes care of Clifford when Hepzibah is occupied with running the shop. Phoebe's presence has a positive influence on Clifford's demeanor, providing him with companionship, engaging conversations, and emotional support. This impact lessens Clifford's dependence on Hepzibah for comfort, allowing her to focus on managing the family's financial situation through their shop.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hepzibah considered a desperate measure of changing her appearance with ribbons to win Clifford's affection, but ultimately decided against it. Phoebe played a significant role in this situation by providing the emotional and mental support that Clifford required, reducing Hepzibah's burden and enabling her to manage their shop effectively." />
    <node id="Clifford sheds tears due to his sensitivity towards ugliness, both spiritual and physical, which overpowers him as he lacks a strong sense of humor to counteract such unpleasantness (as described in clause 1). His reaction to the political procession suggests that he has a deep longing for connection and excitement, despite his melancholy demeanor (clause 2). The narrative highlights Clifford's delicate personality, making him emotionally vulnerable and curious about the outside world." />
    <node id="The guests present at the sober festival in the garden after church time were Holgrave, an artist who was a friend of Hepzibah's and had some unconventional traits, and Uncle Venner, a regular guest who was known for his patched coat and shirt. Holgrave is described as having queer and questionable traits, but he held a high place in Hepzibah's regard. Uncle Venner, on the other hand, was described as being more respectable than usual, with a clean shirt and broadcloth coat that had neat patches on each elbow. The slight inequality in the length of the skirts of his coat suggests that it might have been made from two different coats of different lengths." />

One was the artist Holgrave, who, in spite&#10;         of his consociation with reformers, and his other queer and&#10;         questionable traits, continued to hold an elevated place in Hepzibah's&#10;         regard.  The other, we are almost ashamed to say, was the venerable&#10;         Uncle Venner, in a clean shirt, and a broadcloth coat, more respectable&#10;         than his ordinary wear, inasmuch as it was neatly patched on each&#10;         elbow, and might be called an entire garment, except for a slight&#10;         inequality in the length of its skirts.

The&#10;         truth was, however, that his fancy--reviving faster than his will and&#10;         judgment, and always stronger than they--created shapes of loveliness&#10;         that were symbolic of his native character, and now and then a stern&#10;         and dreadful shape that typified his fate.&#10;&#10;         On Sundays, after Phoebe had been at church,--for the girl had a&#10;         church-going conscience, and would hardly have been at ease had she&#10;         missed either prayer, singing, sermon, or benediction,--after&#10;         church-time, therefore, there was, ordinarily, a sober little festival&#10; " />

She had seen or heard a bee there, on the first day of her&#10;         acquaintance with the place.  And often,--almost continually,&#10;         indeed,--since then, the bees kept coming thither, Heaven knows why, or&#10;         by what pertinacious desire, for far-fetched sweets, when, no doubt,&#10;         there were broad clover-fields, and all kinds of garden growth, much&#10;         nearer home than this.

    <node id="Poets tend to choose their mates for qualities that could make any ordinary handicraftsman happy instead of for similar poetic endowments because at the height of their creativity, poets may not need human intercourse. However, they find it dreary to descend from their lofty heights and be strangers in the world. This tendency can be linked to the idea of an instinctive yearning for a sense of belonging or &quot;home&quot; because, at their core, poets are still human and desire connection and companionship. By choosing partners with more ordinary qualities, they may find a greater sense of normalcy and comfort, giving them a feeling of being anchored in the world, which is akin to having a home. This notion aligns with the given narrative's description of how the warmth and tenderness of human touch can make one feel connected to the &quot;whole sympathetic chain of human nature&quot; and certain about their place in it, making the world seem less like a delusion." />

The world was no longer a delusion.&#10;&#10;    By looking a little further in this direction, we might suggest an&#10;    explanation of an often-suggested mystery.  Why are poets so apt to&#10;    choose their mates, not for any similarity of poetic endowment, but for&#10;    qualities which might make the happiness of the rudest handicraftsman&#10;    as well as that of the ideal craftsman of the spirit?

Yes;&#10;     and, moved by the self-same impulse, a lover saluted his mistress on&#10;     her lips!

But the young and&#10;    happy are not ill pleased to temper their life with a transparent&#10;    shadow.  The deepest pathos of Phoebe's voice and song, moreover, came&#10;    sifted through the golden texture of a cheery spirit, and was somehow&#10;    so interfused with the quality thence acquired, that one's heart felt" />

The effect is as if the voice had&#10;    been dyed black; or,--if we must use a more moderate simile,--this&#10;    miserable croak, running through all the variations of the voice, is&#10;    like a black silken thread, on which the crystal beads of speech are&#10;    strung, and whence they take their hue.  Such voices have put on&#10;    mourning for dead hopes; and they ought to die and be buried along with&#10;    them!&#10;&#10;    Discerning that Clifford was not gladdened by her efforts, Hepzibah&#10;    searched about the house for" />
    <node id="Hepzibah observes her brother Clifford engaging in his favorite childhood amusement, blowing soap-bubbles. This activity brings him joy and reminds him of happier times from their past. The soap-bubbles themselves are described as &quot;airy spheres&quot; and &quot;little impalpable worlds&quot; with the big world depicted on their surface in bright, imaginative hues. These descriptions suggest a contrast between the simplicity of the soap-bubbles and the complexity of the world they represent.&#10;&#10;People who pass by on the street react to the floating soap-bubbles with interest and delight, stopping to gaze at them and perhaps carrying the image of the bright, colorful bubbles with them as a source of joy in their daily lives. This reaction highlights the transformative power of beauty and imagination, even in the form of something as simple as a soap-bubble.&#10;&#10;Hepzibah watches her brother's enjoyment of this activity with a mixture of emotions, including pleasure and sadness, as she reflects on the fact that he has returned to childhood pursuits as a way of coping with his current situation. Despite her own struggles and melancholy, Hepzibah takes joy in seeing her brother find happiness in something so simple and nostalgic." />

Behold him, with his gray hair, and a wan, unreal smile over&#10;     his countenance, where still hovered a beautiful grace, which his worst&#10;     enemy must have acknowledged to be spiritual and immortal, since it had&#10;     survived so long!

    <node id="Clifford urgently gestured towards the balcony, feeling an impulse to leap into the street, possibly driven by a mix of terror and a natural magnetism towards humanity. His companions, Hepzibah and Phoebe, prevented him from doing so out of fear for his safety, interpreting his gesture as that of a man being hurried away against his will. They could not comprehend the emotional turmoil he was experiencing at the moment. The narrator highlights how Clifford, having been isolated for so long, is deeply moved by human interaction and connection, symbolized here by the bustling street scene outside his window." />

He shuddered; he grew pale; he threw an&#10;     appealing look at Hepzibah and Phoebe, who were with him at the window.&#10;     They comprehended nothing of his emotions, and supposed him merely&#10;     disturbed by the unaccustomed tumult.  At last, with tremulous limbs,&#10;     he started up, set his foot on the window-sill, and in an instant more&#10;     would have been in the unguarded balcony.  As it was, the whole&#10;     procession might have seen him, a wild, haggard figure, his gray locks&#10;     floating in the wind that waved their banners; a lonely being,&#10;     estranged from his race, but now feeling himself man again, by virtue&#10;     of the irrepressible instinct that possessed him.

    <node id="Surely! The passage describes how Phoebe, a lively and observant character, brings life and joy to Clifford through her presence and conversations about their surroundings. One of the pleasant incidents that started happening in the secluded garden after Phoebe made an effort to notice them was the frequent arrival of bees. These bees would visit the garden's squash-blossoms regularly, seemingly attracted by their sweetness, despite the availability of other sources of nectar closer to their homes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Phoebe's presence helped Clifford rejuvenate and regain some of his childlike enthusiasm for life. He would delight in watching hummingbirds and observing flowers, taking pleasure in the garden's beauty and sharing these moments with Phoebe. Hepzibah, another character, notices this change in Clifford, experiencing a strange mix of emotions—motherly concern, sisterly love, and a sense of both happiness and sadness—as she witnesses his joy.&#10;&#10;In summary, the frequent arrival of bees to the garden is one of the delightful incidents that occurred due to Phoebe's attentiveness and appreciation for her surroundings. This anecdote highlights how her presence positively influenced Clifford, allowing him to reconnect with nature and regain some of his youthful wonderment." />
    <node id=" Hepzibah endeavored to arouse him.  Phoebe's&#10;    presence, and the contiguity of her fresh life to his blighted one, was&#10;    usually all that he required. Indeed, such was the native gush and play&#10;    of her spirit, that she was seldom perfectly quiet and undemonstrative,&#10;    any more than a fountain ever ceases to dimple and warble with its&#10;    flow. She possessed the gift of song, and that, too, so naturally, that&#10;    you would as little think of inquiring whence she had caught it, or&#10;    what master had taught her, as of asking the same questions about a&#10;    bird, in whose small strain of music we recognize the voice of the&#10;    Creator as distinctly as in the loudest accents of his thunder. So long&#10;    as Phoebe sang, she might stray at her own will about the house.&#10;    Clifford was content, whether the sweet, airy homeliness of her tones&#10;    came down from the upper chambers, or along the passageway from the&#10;  " />
    <node id="Based on Clifford's reaction to Judge Pyncheon's sudden appearance and sarcastic comment, it can be inferred that he feels a native and original horror of the Judge. This fear is not due to any specific cause from his past experience but rather an innate dread of the strong-willed relative in the presence of massive strength. Clifford, being a weak, delicate, and apprehensive character, finds strength incomprehensible and therefore more terrible. The Judge's tone, although seemingly kind and soothing, contains a bitterness of sarcasm that further unsettles Clifford." />
    <node id="The gathering is a sober festival that takes place in the garden after church time. It includes Hepzibah, her brother Clifford, Phoebe, Uncle Venner, and Holgrave the artist. The conversations likely involve a range of topics, given the diverse backgrounds and interests of the individuals present. For example, Holgrave is associated with reformers and has unconventional traits, while Uncle Venner is known for his wisdom and observations about the world.&#10;&#10;Uncle Venner particularly enjoys these gatherings and compares them to what he expects to experience after he retires to his farm. This suggests that he finds the conversations pleasant and fulfilling, and that he values the companionship of the group. The clean shirt and respectable coat he wears for the occasion also indicate that he takes these gatherings seriously and wants to present himself in a positive light." />

And Uncle Venner,&#10;         who had studied the world at street-corners, and other posts equally&#10;         well adapted for just observation, was as ready to give out his wisdom&#10;         as a town-pump to give water.&#10;&#10;         &quot;Miss Hepzibah, ma'am,&quot; said he once, after they had all been cheerful&#10;         together, &quot;I really enjoy these quiet little meetings of a Sabbath&#10;         afternoon.

    <node id="Clifford's experience in the garden and his interest in flowers are deeply connected to his emotional state and his companionship with Phoebe. According to Phoebe's observations, Clifford has a sensitive appreciation for the beauty of flowers, finding delight not only in their appearance but also in their perfume and the life they embody. His feelings towards flowers seem to transcend mere aesthetic pleasure, as he perceives them as if they have sentiment and intelligence, much like how one might attribute human qualities to another person.&#10;&#10;This trait of appreciating flowers is described as being almost exclusively a woman's trait, suggesting that Clifford's connection to the garden and its blossoms reflects his softer, more vulnerable side. Men, it is implied, often lose or suppress this sensitivity in their interactions with coarser aspects of life. However, Clifford appears to be rediscovering this aspect of himself as he reawakens from a state of emotional numbness.&#10;&#10;As Phoebe talks about flowers and the garden, Clifford becomes more engaged, asking her about the blooms that have appeared since the previous day. He takes pleasure in observing the details of each flower and appears to develop an emotional connection with them, at times comparing them to Phoebe herself. This comparison further highlights the significance of Phoebe's role in Clifford's life, as she brings him joy and serves as a source of comfort and companionship for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Clifford's interest in flowers and his experiences in the garden represent his emotional rejuvenation and the blossoming of his sensitivity, which had been suppressed due to external circumstances. His connection with flowers also symbolizes his growing bond with Phoebe, who serves as a catalyst for his personal growth and healing process." />

    <node id="The protagonist, Clifford, struggles with wretchedness as a result of a lifetime of learning to be miserable, as he puts it. This is likely due to the many hardships and misfortunes he has experienced, including being wrongly imprisoned for many years.

    <node id="The artist mentioned in the narrative is Geoffrey Manzonni. The potential hidden interest he has in the scene at the shop is not explicitly stated, but Hawthorne notes that there are &quot;questionable&quot; expressions in his deep eyes, suggesting that he might have an ulterior motive or curiosity beyond a stranger's typical engagement with the scene.&#10;&#10;Manzonni successfully enlivens the party by applying himself to various tasks and conversations that appeal to the women. He compliments Hepzibah on her appearance, which helps momentarily distract her from her sadness. For Phoebe, Manzonni shares his artistic knowledge of flowers and gardens with her, sparking engaging conversations she finds delightful and pleasant.&#10;&#10;In summary, Geoffrey Manzonni's hidden interest in the scene is unclear, but he successfully enlivens the party by connecting with Hepzibah and Phoebe on their individual levels—flattery for Hepzibah and shared interests for Phoebe—leading to their positive impressions of him." />

With&#10;great mobility of outward mood, however, he applied himself to the task&#10;of enlivening the party; and with so much success, that even dark-hued&#10;Hepzibah threw off one tint of melancholy, and made what shift she&#10;could with the remaining portion.

This gaze penetrates the obscurity behind the arched window where Clifford is sitting, indicating that he recognizes the source of the bubble.&#10;&#10;2. The elderly gentleman's expression soon turns into a smile, suggesting that he quickly shifts from initial surprise or annoyance to amusement and good humor.

However, they find it dreary to descend from their lofty heights and be strangers in the world. This tendency can be linked to the idea of an instinctive yearning for a sense of belonging or &quot;home&quot; because, at their core, poets are still human and desire connection and companionship. By choosing partners with more ordinary qualities, they may find a greater sense of normalcy and comfort, giving them a feeling of being anchored in the world, which is akin to having a home. This notion aligns with the given narrative's description of how the warmth and tenderness of human touch can make one feel connected to the &quot;whole sympathetic chain of human nature&quot; and certain about their place in it, making the world seem less like a delusion.">

One of the pleasant incidents that started happening in the secluded garden after Phoebe made an effort to notice them was the frequent arrival of bees. These bees would visit the garden's squash-blossoms regularly, seemingly attracted by their sweetness, despite the availability of other sources of nectar closer to their homes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Phoebe's presence helped Clifford rejuvenate and regain some of his childlike enthusiasm for life. He would delight in watching hummingbirds and observing flowers, taking pleasure in the garden's beauty and sharing these moments with Phoebe. Hepzibah, another character, notices this change in Clifford, experiencing a strange mix of emotions—motherly concern, sisterly love, and a sense of both happiness and sadness—as she witnesses his joy.&#10;&#10;In summary, the frequent arrival of bees to the garden is one of the delightful incidents that occurred due to Phoebe's attentiveness and appreciation for her surroundings. This anecdote highlights how her presence positively influenced Clifford, allowing him to reconnect with nature and regain some of his youthful wonderment.">

Fourier proposed that individuals would be happiest if they lived and worked together in small, self-sufficient communities called phalansteries, sharing resources and collaborating on tasks. This idea of shared resources and community living aligns with Uncle Venner's perspective on the sufficiency of the infinite and eternal for human needs and desires.">

The life of the garden offered&#10;         topics enough for such discourse as suited Clifford best.  He never&#10;         failed to inquire what flowers had bloomed since yesterday.  His&#10;         feeling for flowers was very exquisite, and seemed not so much a taste&#10;         as an emotion; he was fond of sitting with one in his hand, intently&#10;         observing it, and looking from its petals into Phoebe's face, as if the&#10;         garden flower were the sister of the household maiden.  Not merely was&#10;         there a" target="Clifford's experience in the garden and his interest in flowers are deeply connected to his emotional state and his companionship with Phoebe. According to Phoebe's observations, Clifford has a sensitive appreciation for the beauty of flowers, finding delight not only in their appearance but also in their perfume and the life they embody. His feelings towards flowers seem to transcend mere aesthetic pleasure, as he perceives them as if they have sentiment and intelligence, much like how one might attribute human qualities to another person.&#10;&#10;This trait of appreciating flowers is described as being almost exclusively a woman's trait, suggesting that Clifford's connection to the garden and its blossoms reflects his softer, more vulnerable side. Men, it is implied, often lose or suppress this sensitivity in their interactions with coarser aspects of life. However, Clifford appears to be rediscovering this aspect of himself as he reawakens from a state of emotional numbness.&#10;&#10;As Phoebe talks about flowers and the garden, Clifford becomes more engaged, asking her about the blooms that have appeared since the previous day. He takes pleasure in observing the details of each flower and appears to develop an emotional connection with them, at times comparing them to Phoebe herself. This comparison further highlights the significance of Phoebe's role in Clifford's life, as she brings him joy and serves as a source of comfort and companionship for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Clifford's interest in flowers and his experiences in the garden represent his emotional rejuvenation and the blossoming of his sensitivity, which had been suppressed due to external circumstances. His connection with flowers also symbolizes his growing bond with Phoebe, who serves as a catalyst for his personal growth and healing process.">

He also perceives life, character, and individuality in these blossoms, treating them as if they have sentiment and intelligence (almost exclusively a woman's trait).&#10;&#10;2. The City: Clifford enjoys observing the simple happenings of city life. Familiar things like cabs, omnibuses with their passengers, shop windows, pedestrians, and various activities along Pyncheon Street all capture his interest and engage his observation skills.&#10;&#10;3. A large bubble bursting on an elderly gentleman's nose: The unexpected incident amuses the passerby, who initially reacted to it with suspicion or annoyance. This situation highlights Clifford's simple delight in observing human reactions and ordinary events.&#10;&#10;4.

For example, Holgrave is associated with reformers and has unconventional traits, while Uncle Venner is known for his wisdom and observations about the world.&#10;&#10;Uncle Venner particularly enjoys these gatherings and compares them to what he expects to experience after he retires to his farm. This suggests that he finds the conversations pleasant and fulfilling, and that he values the companionship of the group.

His feelings towards flowers seem to transcend mere aesthetic pleasure, as he perceives them as if they have sentiment and intelligence, much like how one might attribute human qualities to another person.&#10;&#10;This trait of appreciating flowers is described as being almost exclusively a woman's trait, suggesting that Clifford's connection to the garden and its blossoms reflects his softer, more vulnerable side. Men, it is implied, often lose or suppress this sensitivity in their interactions with coarser aspects of life. However, Clifford appears to be rediscovering this aspect of himself as he reawakens from a state of emotional numbness.&#10;&#10;As Phoebe talks about flowers and the garden, Clifford becomes more engaged, asking her about the blooms that have appeared since the previous day. He takes pleasure in observing the details of each flower and appears to develop an emotional connection with them, at times comparing them to Phoebe herself. This comparison further highlights the significance of Phoebe's role in Clifford's life, as she brings him joy and serves as a source of comfort and companionship for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Clifford's interest in flowers and his experiences in the garden represent his emotional rejuvenation and the blossoming of his sensitivity, which had been suppressed due to external circumstances. His connection with flowers also symbolizes his growing bond with Phoebe, who serves as a catalyst for his personal growth and healing process.">

    <edge source="Surely! The passage describes how Phoebe, a lively and observant character, brings life and joy to Clifford through her presence and conversations about their surroundings. One of the pleasant incidents that started happening in the secluded garden after Phoebe made an effort to notice them was the frequent arrival of bees. These bees would visit the garden's squash-blossoms regularly, seemingly attracted by their sweetness, despite the availability of other sources of nectar closer to their homes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Phoebe's presence helped Clifford rejuvenate and regain some of his childlike enthusiasm for life. He would delight in watching hummingbirds and observing flowers, taking pleasure in the garden's beauty and sharing these moments with Phoebe. Hepzibah, another character, notices this change in Clifford, experiencing a strange mix of emotions—motherly concern, sisterly love, and a sense of both happiness and sadness—as she witnesses his joy.&#10;&#10;In summary, the frequent arrival of bees to the garden is one of the delightful incidents that occurred due to Phoebe's attentiveness and appreciation for her surroundings. This anecdote highlights how her presence positively influenced Clifford, allowing him to reconnect with nature and regain some of his youthful wonderment." target="The artist mentioned in the narrative is Geoffrey Manzonni. The potential hidden interest he has in the scene at the shop is not explicitly stated, but Hawthorne notes that there are &quot;questionable&quot; expressions in his deep eyes, suggesting that he might have an ulterior motive or curiosity beyond a stranger's typical engagement with the scene.&#10;&#10;Manzonni successfully enlivens the party by applying himself to various tasks and conversations that appeal to the women. He compliments Hepzibah on her appearance, which helps momentarily distract her from her sadness. For Phoebe, Manzonni shares his artistic knowledge of flowers and gardens with her, sparking engaging conversations she finds delightful and pleasant.&#10;&#10;In summary, Geoffrey Manzonni's hidden interest in the scene is unclear, but he successfully enlivens the party by connecting with Hepzibah and Phoebe on their individual levels—flattery for Hepzibah and shared interests for Phoebe—leading to their positive impressions of him.">

The conversations likely involve a range of topics, given the diverse backgrounds and interests of the individuals present. For example, Holgrave is associated with reformers and has unconventional traits, while Uncle Venner is known for his wisdom and observations about the world.&#10;&#10;Uncle Venner particularly enjoys these gatherings and compares them to what he expects to experience after he retires to his farm.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott had an enlightening experience at the United and Fraternal Order of Beavers' (U.F.O.B.) annual state convention in Joralemon. She initially thought of the Beavers as a group of average citizens who gathered for cheap life insurance and poker games, but she discovered that they were much more influential. According to a large poster, the Beavers were &quot;the greatest influence for good citizenship in the country&quot; and a &quot;jolly aggregation of red-blooded, open-handed, hustle-em-up good fellows in the world.&quot; The attendees wore badges that identified them as &quot;Sir Knight and Brother, U.F.O.B., Annual State Convention&quot; or &quot;Sir Knight's Lady,&quot; while the Duluth delegation's famous Beaver amateur band performed in Zouave costumes of green velvet jackets, blue trousers, and scarlet fezzes.&#10;&#10;Carol felt out of place due to the amused stares she received from onlookers because of her companion's eccentric attire—a man's cap, a skinny fur like a dead cat, an imitation pearl necklace, a scabrous satin blouse, and a thick cloth skirt hiked up in front. The convention made Carol realize that the Beavers were a powerful organization with a strong presence in the community." />

In the lee of the stonily mature trio&#10;Carol proceeded to the street fair which added mundane gaiety to the&#10;annual rites of the United and Fraternal Order of Beavers. Beavers,&#10;human Beavers, were everywhere: thirty-second degree Beavers in gray&#10;sack suits and decent derbies, more flippant Beavers in crash summer&#10;coats and straw hats, rustic Beavers in shirt sleeves and frayed&#10;suspenders; but whatever his caste-symbols, every Beaver was&#10;distinguished by an enormous shrimp-colored ribbon lettered in silver,&#10;&quot;Sir Knight and Brother, U.

    <node id="&quot;Sir Knight and Brother, U. F. O. B., Annual State Convention.&quot; On the&#10;motherly shirtwaist of each of their wives was a badge &quot;Sir Knight's&#10;Lady.&quot; The Duluth delegation had brought their famous Beaver amateur&#10;band, in Zouave costumes of green velvet jacket, blue trousers, and&#10;scarlet fez. The strange thing was that beneath their scarlet pride the&#10;Zouaves' faces remained those of American business-men, pink, smooth,&#10;eye-glassed; and as they stood playing in a circle, at the corner of&#10;Main Street and Second, as they tootled on fifes or with swelling cheeks&#10;blew into cornets, their eyes remained as owlish as though they were&#10;sitting at desks under the sign &quot;This Is My Busy Day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol had supposed that the Beavers were average citizens organized for&#10;the purposes of getting cheap life-insurance and playing poker at the&#10;lodge-rooms every second Wednesday, but she saw a large poster which&#10;proclaimed:&#10;&#10;     BEAVERS&#10;     U.

Never joined. Don't know but what I will.&quot;&#10;&#10;Calibree adumbrated, &quot;They're a good bunch. Good strong lodge. See that&#10;fellow there that's playing the snare drum? He's the smartest wholesale&#10;grocer in Duluth, they say. Guess it would be worth joining. Oh say, are&#10;you doing much insurance examining?&quot;&#10;&#10;They went on to the street fair.&#10;&#10;Lining one block of Main Street were the &quot;attractions&quot;--two hot-dog&#10;stands, a lemonade and pop-corn stand, a merry-go-round, and booths in&#10;which balls might be thrown at rag dolls, if one wished" />
    <node id=" nothing else to do, Carol went. But she was&#10;uncomfortable in the presence of the amused stares which Mrs.&#10;Flickerbaugh's raiment drew. Today, in reeking early August, she wore a&#10;man's cap, a skinny fur like a dead cat, a necklace of imitation pearls,&#10;a scabrous satin blouse, and a thick cloth skirt hiked up in front.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come in. Sit down. Stick the baby in that rocker. Hope you don't mind&#10;the house looking like a rat's nest. You don't like this town. Neither&#10;do I,&quot; said Mrs. Flickerbaugh.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Course you don't!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well then, I don't!

Solution: find the hexagonal hole.&quot; Carol&#10;was very brisk.&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know you ever will find it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There's Mrs. Westlake.

    <node id=" He slipped&#10;his arm about Carol's shoulder; he went down to supper rejoicing that he&#10;was cleansed of perilous stuff. While Carol was putting the baby to&#10;bed he sat on the front steps. Nat Hicks, tailor and roue, came to sit&#10;beside him. Between waves of his hand as he drove off mosquitos, Nat&#10;whispered, &quot;Say, doc, you don't feel like imagining you're a bacheldore&#10;again, and coming out for a Time tonight, do you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As how?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know this new dressmaker, Mrs. Swiftwaite?--swell dame with&#10;blondine hair?

The addition&#10;gave her a kitchen with a bedroom above. The original one-room shack was&#10;now a living-room, with the phonograph, a genuine leather-upholstered&#10;golden-oak rocker, and a picture of Governor John Johnson.&#10;&#10;In late July Carol went to the Bjornstams' desirous of a chance to&#10;express her opinion of Beavers and Calibrees and Joralemons. She found&#10;Olaf abed, restless from a slight fever, and Bea flushed and dizzy but&#10;trying to keep up her work. She lured Miles aside and worried:&#10;&#10;&quot;They don't look at all well. What's the matter?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Their stomachs are out of whack. I wanted to call in Doc Kennicott," />
    <node id="The woman, Carol, is trying to convince Will to come over to her house on Dave's evening off because she is feeling lonely and wants his company. She also mentions that Dave will be at work until midnight due to a clerk being called away, so he won't be around to disapprove or interrupt their plans.

When he's cutting up at parties I see you standing back and&#10;watching him--the way a mastiff watches a terrier.&quot;&#10;&#10;He fought for professional dignity with, &quot;Dave 's not a bad fellow.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lingeringly she released his hand. &quot;Will, drop round by the house this&#10;evening and scold me.

You know I never hint around, but haven't you&#10;felt that----&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol was furious. &quot;I don't pretend that Will has no faults. But one&#10;thing I do know: He's as simple-hearted about what you call 'goings-on'&#10;as a babe. And if he ever were such a sad dog as to look at another&#10;woman, I certainly hope he'd have spirit enough to do the tempting, and&#10;not be coaxed into it, as in your depressing picture!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, what a wicked thing to say, Carrie!&quot; from Aunt Bessie.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, I mean it!

She's got more&#10;life to her than Carol has. All my fault, anyway. Why can't I be more&#10;cagey, like Calibree and McGanum and the rest of the doctors? Oh, I&#10;am, but Maud's such a demanding idiot. Deliberately bamboozling me into&#10;going up there tonight. Matter of principle: ought not to let her get&#10;away with it. I won't go. I'll call her up and tell her I won't go.&#10;Me, with Carrie at home, finest little woman in the world, and a&#10;messy-minded female like Maud Dyer--no, SIR!

    <node id="rescent of blackness was formed in&#10;the gray dust.&#10;&#10;Dave Dyer came along.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where going, Dave?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Down to the store.

Better drop in and have a cigar, if you're downtown.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I may, at that. May have to go down and see Mrs. Champ Perry.&#10;She's ailing. So long, Dave.&quot;&#10;&#10;Kennicott had not yet entered the house. He was conscious that Carol was&#10;near him, that she was important, that he was afraid of her disapproval;&#10;but he was content to be alone.

    <node id=" this&#10;trip?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I haven't any subscription-list, Will. I want to see you&#10;professionally.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you a Christian Scientist?

It's just that my faith isn't strong enough yet. So there&#10;now! And besides, you ARE kind of consoling, Will. I mean as a man, not&#10;just as a doctor. You're so strong and placid.&quot;&#10;&#10;He sat on the edge of his desk, coatless, his vest swinging open with&#10;the thick gold line of his watch-chain across the gap, his hands in his&#10;trousers pockets, his big arms bent and easy. As she purred he cocked&#10;an interested eye. Maud Dyer was neurotic, religiocentric, faded; her&#10;emotions were moist, and her figure was unsystematic--splendid thighs&#10;and arms, with thick ankles, and a body" />
    <node id="Kennicott's intentions for their new house are to make it a comfortable and practical home for Carol and their baby. He wants to build a sound example of the Sam Clark school, which prioritizes having the inside of the house right. He emphasizes this by bringing up Uncle Whit's wisdom in making his store successful, implying that he values functionality and comfort over external appearances. Kennicott also makes plans for closets for Carol's clothes and a sewing-room, showing his consideration for her needs. However, his greater attention to the garage's details, such as a cement floor, work-bench, and gasoline-tank, suggests that he prioritizes practicality and is more interested in the garage than the sewing-room. Overall, Kennicott aims to create a comfortable and functional home for his family, but his priorities may not align perfectly with Carol's desires." />
    <node id=" She was certain that they were discussing her, and foully&#10;forgiving her. She lay awake till she heard the distant creak of a bed&#10;which indicated that Kennicott had retired. Then she felt safe.&#10;&#10;It was Kennicott who brought up the matter of the Smails at breakfast.&#10;With no visible connection he said, &quot;Uncle Whit is kind of clumsy, but&#10;just the same, he's a pretty wise old coot. He's certainly making good&#10;with the store.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol smiled, and Kennicott was pleased that she had come to her senses.&#10;&quot;As Whit says, after all the first thing is to have the inside of a&#10;house right, and darn the people on the outside looking in!&quot;&#10;&#10;It seemed settled that the house was to be a sound example of the Sam&#10;Clark school.&#10;&#10;Kennicott made much of erecting it entirely for her and the baby. He&#10;spoke of closets for her frocks, and &quot;a comfy sewing-room.&quot; But when&#10;he drew on a leaf from an old account-book (he was a paper-saver and a&#10;string-picker) the plans for the garage, he gave" />

But the new place would be smooth, standardized, fixed. It was&#10;probable, now that Kennicott was past forty, and settled, that this&#10;would be the last venture he would ever make in building. So long as she&#10;stayed in this ark, she would always have a possibility of change, but&#10;once she was in the new house, there she would sit for all the rest of&#10;her life--there she would die. Desperately she wanted to put it off,&#10;against the chance of miracles.

I know how it is with young folks like you, Carrie; you want&#10;towers and bay-windows and pianos and heaven knows what all, but the&#10;thing to get is closets and a good furnace and a handy place to hang out&#10;the washing, and the rest don't matter.&quot;&#10;&#10;Uncle Whittier dribbled a little, put his face near to Carol's, and&#10;sputtered, &quot;Course it don't!

Drat him!&quot; Mrs. Westlake laughed&#10;comfortably.&#10;&#10;After such a disclosure what could Carol do but return the courtesy by&#10;remarking that as for Kennicott, he wasn't romantic enough--the darling.&#10;Before she left she had babbled to Mrs. Westlake her dislike for Aunt&#10;Bessie, the fact that Kennicott's income was now more than five thousand&#10;a year, her view of the reason why Vida had married Raymie (which&#10;included some thoroughly insincere praise of Raymie's &quot;kind heart&quot;), her&#10;opinion of the library-board, just what Kennicott had said about Mrs.&#10;Carthal's diabetes, and what Kennicott thought of the several surgeons&#10;in the Cities.&#10;&#10;She went" />

Every year Kennicott had talked of attending the American Medical&#10;Association convention, &quot;and then afterwards we could do the East&#10;up brown.

It seemed that Kennicott had&#10;to make a professional call on Mrs. Dave Dyer.&#10;&#10;Under the stilly boughs and the black gauze of dusk the street was&#10;meshed in silence. There was but the hum of motor tires crunching the&#10;road, the creak of a rocker on the Howlands' porch, the slap of a hand&#10;attacking a mosquito, a heat-weary conversation starting and dying, the&#10;precise rhythm of crickets, the thud of moths against the screen--sounds&#10;that were a distilled silence.

She giggled and bounced when Cy&#10;tickled her ear in village love. They strolled with the half-dancing&#10;gait of lovers, kicking their feet out sideways or shuffling a dragging&#10;jig, and the concrete walk sounded to the broken two-four rhythm. Their&#10;voices had a dusky turbulence. Suddenly, to the woman rocking on the&#10;porch of the doctor's house, the night came alive, and she felt that&#10;everywhere in the darkness panted an ardent quest which she was missing&#10;as she sank back to wait for----There must be something.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Since there were no sweating passengers crammed&#10;in beside her, she reveled in the train's slowness. She was part of&#10;these lakes and tawny wheat-fields. She liked the smell of hot earth and&#10;clean grease; and the leisurely chug-a-chug, chug-a-chug of the trucks&#10;was a song of contentment in the sun.&#10;&#10;She pretended that she was going to the Rockies. When they reached&#10;Joralemon she was radiant with holiday-making.&#10;&#10;Her eagerness began to lessen the moment they stopped at a red frame&#10;station exactly like the one they had just left at Gopher Prairie,&#10;and Kennicott yawned, &quot;Right on time.

She doubted her&#10;world, doubted herself, and was sick in the acid, smoke-stained air.&#10;&#10;She slipped back into brooding upon the habituality of the house.&#10;&#10;Kennicott was as fixed in routine as an isolated old man. At first&#10;he had amorously deceived himself into liking her experiments with&#10;food--the one medium in which she could express imagination--but now&#10;he wanted only his round of favorite dishes: steak, roast beef, boiled&#10;pig's-feet, oatmeal, baked apples. Because at some more flexible period&#10;he had advanced from oranges to grape-fruit he considered himself an&#10;epicure.&#10;&#10;During their first autumn she had smiled over his affection for his&#10;hunting-coat, but now that the leather had come unstitched in dribbles&#10;of pale yellow thread, and tatters of canvas, smeared with dirt of the&#10;fields and grease from gun-cleaning, hung in a border of rags, she hated&#10;the thing.&#10;&#10;Wasn't her whole life like that hunting" />

He must have felt guilty, everybody agreed,&#10;for as the train left town, a farmer saw him standing in the vestibule&#10;and looking out.&#10;&#10;His house--with the addition which he had built four months ago--was&#10;very near the track on which his train passed.&#10;&#10;When Carol went there, for the last time, she found Olaf's chariot with&#10;its red spool wheels standing in the sunny corner beside the stable. She&#10;wondered if a quick eye could have noticed it from a train.&#10;&#10;That day and that week she went reluctantly to Red Cross work; she&#10;stitched and packed silently, while Vida read the war bulletins. And she&#10;said nothing at all when Kennicott commented, &quot;From what Champ says,&#10;I guess Bjornstam was a bad egg, after all. In spite of Bea, don't&#10;know but what the citizens' committee ought to have forced him to&#10;be patriotic--let on like they could send him to jail if he didn't&#10;volunteer and come through for bonds and the Y.

He was curiously like his own brown-painted motor car, with&#10;eye-glasses for windshield. &quot;Want you to meet my wife, doctor--Carrie,&#10;make you 'quainted with Dr. Calibree,&quot; said Kennicott. Calibree bowed&#10;quietly and shook her hand, but before he had finished shaking it he was&#10;concentrating upon Kennicott with, &quot;Nice to see you, doctor.

    <node id="Carole's irritation with the clerk at Oleson &amp; McGuire's was due to her frayed nerves from the heat, and his brusque manner. She became further upset with his suggestions for her supper choices because she saw it as an unwanted attempt to instruct her in housekeeping, and a disregard for her personal preferences.

He was no more brusquely familiar than a dozen&#10;other clerks of the town, but her nerves were heat-scorched.&#10;&#10;When she asked for codfish, for supper, he grunted, &quot;What d'you want&#10;that darned old dry stuff for?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I like it!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Punk!

She had&#10;hoped for tiling, and a kerosene range for summer cooking, but Kennicott&#10;always postponed these expenses.&#10;&#10;She was better acquainted with the utensils in the kitchen than with&#10;Vida Sherwin or Guy Pollock. The can-opener, whose soft gray metal&#10;handle was twisted from some ancient effort to pry open a window,&#10;was more pertinent to her than all the cathedrals in Europe; and&#10;more significant than the future of Asia was the never-settled weekly&#10;question as to whether the small kitchen knife with the unpainted handle&#10;or the second-best buckhorn carving-knife was better for cutting up cold&#10;chicken for Sunday supper.&#10;&#10;&#10;II&#10;&#10;&#10;She was ignored by the males till midnight.

    <node id="CHAPTER XXIV&#10;&#10;&#10;I&#10;&#10;ALL that midsummer month Carol was sensitive to Kennicott. She recalled&#10;a hundred grotesqueries: her comic dismay at his having chewed tobacco,&#10;the evening when she had tried to read poetry to him; matters which had&#10;seemed to vanish with no trace or sequence. Always she repeated that&#10;he had been heroically patient in his desire to join the army. She made&#10;much of her consoling affection for him in little things. She liked the&#10;homeliness of his tinkering about the house; his strength and handiness&#10;as he tightened the hinges of a shutter; his boyishness when he ran&#10;to her to be comforted because he had found rust in the barrel of his&#10;pump-gun. But at the highest he was to her another Hugh, without the&#10;glamor of Hugh's unknown future.&#10;&#10;There was, late in June, a day of heat-lightning.&#10;&#10;Because of the work imposed by the absence of the other doctors the&#10;Kennicotts had not moved to the lake cottage but remained in town, dusty&#10;and irritable. In the afternoon, when she went to Oleson &amp; McGuire's&#10;" />
    <node id="The big-city woman, Carol, faces a future where she may become increasingly cynical, isolated, and bitter about her life in the small town. She is already experiencing physical discomfort from the daily grind of housework and childcare, and her ambition has diminished to simply making it through the day. While she finds solace in reading and values her work, she rejects the idea of being praised for labor and feels a growing distance from those around her, including her husband and friends.&#10;&#10;If Carol continues down this path, she may become more and more like the old eccentric woman she fears becoming – an embittered recluse who despises her town and its inhabitants. She may lose touch with her former talents and potential for practical matters and business skills, as suggested by her regret over not becoming a businesswoman. This could lead to a life of unfulfilled dreams and increasing isolation, ultimately impacting her mental and emotional well-being.&#10;&#10;To avoid this fate, Carol should consider finding healthier coping mechanisms beyond reading and seek support from those around her, like Mrs. Westlake, who understands her struggles. Exploring new opportunities within the community or pursuing her interests could also help rekindle her ambition and prevent further disillusionment." />

I can! I've hated it for thirty-two years. I'll die here--and&#10;I'll hate it till I die. I ought to have been a business woman. I had&#10;a good deal of talent for tending to figures. All gone now.

Want an office of my own, and sell things.&#10;Julius never hear of it. Too late.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol sat on the gritty couch, and sank into fear.

    <node id=" eyes ached; she&#10;was not the girl in breeches and a flannel shirt who had cooked over a&#10;camp-fire in the Colorado mountains five years ago. Her ambition was to&#10;get to bed at nine; her strongest emotion was resentment over rising at&#10;half-past six to care for Hugh. The back of her neck ached as she got&#10;out of bed. She was cynical about the joys of a simple laborious life.&#10;She understood why workmen and workmen's wives are not grateful to their&#10;kind employers.&#10;&#10;At mid-morning, when she was momentarily free from the ache in her neck&#10;and back, she was glad of the reality of work. The hours were living&#10;and nimble. But she had no desire to read the eloquent little newspaper&#10;essays in praise of labor which are daily written by the white-browed&#10;journalistic prophets. She felt independent and (though she hid it) a&#10;bit surly.&#10;&#10;In cleaning the house she pondered upon the maid's-room.

    <node id="In this narrative, Carol observes and reflects on her husband Kennicott's behavior and appearance during supper. She notes that he is preoccupied and not fully engaged in their conversation, as he often becomes engrossed in story-books and fails to tend to business matters promptly. This observation causes a feeling of alienation in Carol, who craves more romantic involvement from her husband.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol reflects on Kennicott's appearance, mentioning that she doesn't find him romantic enough. She also comments on his clothing, stating that his hunting-coat is worn and unattractive, which further emphasizes the disparity between her expectations and reality. The coat is described as being patched with grease from gun-cleaning, hanging in a border of rags, something Carol despises.&#10;&#10;Carol's observations about Kennicott and his appearance during supper make her question the monotony of her daily life, causing her to reconsider the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home she once regarded as the basis of all decent life. She wonders whether millions of women have lied to themselves about enjoying housework and suspects that there might be a better way to organize family life.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's realizations highlight the discrepancy between her idealized expectations of married life with Kennicott and the reality of their relationship. This revelation leads her to question societal norms and seek new ways to improve her daily experiences." />
    <node id=" her feet too long at the beginning. The moment&#10;Kennicott had ordered her to bed she had begun to collapse. One early&#10;evening she startled them by screaming, in an intense abdominal pain,&#10;and within half an hour she was in a delirium. Till dawn Carol was&#10;with her, and not all of Bea's groping through the blackness of&#10;half-delirious pain was so pitiful to Carol as the way in which Miles&#10;silently peered into the room from the top of the narrow stairs.&#10;Carol slept three hours next morning, and ran back. Bea was altogether&#10;delirious but she muttered nothing save, &quot;Olaf--ve have such a good&#10;time----&quot;&#10;&#10;At ten, while Carol was preparing an ice-bag in the kitchen, Miles&#10;answered a knock. At the front door she saw Vida Sherwin, Maud Dyer, and&#10;Mrs. Zitterel, wife of the Baptist pastor. They were carrying grapes,&#10;and women's-magazines, magazines with high-colored pictures and&#10;optimistic fiction.&#10;&#10;&quot;We just heard your wife was sick.

Carol was deft, and won shy praise from Kennicott, but as her&#10;shoulder blades began to sting, she wondered how many millions of women&#10;had lied to themselves during the death-rimmed years through which they&#10;had pretended to enjoy the puerile methods persisting in housework.&#10;&#10;She doubted the convenience and, as a natural sequent, the sanctity of&#10;the monogamous and separate home which she had regarded as the basis of&#10;all decent life.&#10;&#10;She considered her doubts vicious. She refused to remember how many of&#10;the women of the Jolly Seventeen nagged their husbands and were nagged&#10;by them.&#10;&#10;She energetically did not whine to Kennicott.

This suggests that he may sometimes perceive his wife's concerns as exaggerated or unfounded, which could potentially lead to misunderstandings in their relationship.&#10;&#10;Regarding fidelity and limitations placed on him by it, the text does not provide explicit information about Will's thoughts. However, there is a suggestion of an intimate moment between Carol and Will when she mentions that he is consoling as a man and finds her attractive, referring to his &quot;strong and placid&quot; nature. Will does not seem to react negatively to her comments, which might imply some level of comfort or attraction towards Carol. However, it is essential to note that the text does not explicitly suggest an inappropriate relationship between them; rather, it hints at a moment of connection between two friends.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Will appears to have a caring relationship with his wife, there may be some occasional misunderstandings regarding her health concerns.

They had not told her that word of&#10;Miles's rebuff to Vida had spread through town, a cyclonic fury.&#10;&#10;It was only by chance that, leaning on her elbow in bed, she glanced&#10;through the window and saw the funeral of Bea and Olaf.

    <node id="The speaker, Will Kennicott, contemplates starting over out West despite his reservations because he feels trapped in Gopher Prairie. He has worked hard to establish his dairy business and build a comfortable life for his family, but he is held back by the social expectations and constraints of the town. He mentions that the townsfolk view him as a &quot;town badman&quot; and that they have him &quot;hypnotized.&quot; Will feels that if he were to move away, people might be more accepting of his individual thoughts and actions.&#10;&#10;Another significant factor in his contemplation is the influence of his wife Bea (short for Beatrice). He values her as a &quot;jolly, square, faithful woman&quot; and wants to provide a good life for her and their child. However, he feels that the town's expectations are limiting their opportunities and keeping them from realizing their full potential. The idea of starting anew out West represents a chance for Will to break free from these constraints and live life on his own terms.&#10;&#10;Will's thoughts about moving away are further solidified when he meets with Miles Bjornstam ('BJ'), who has become a social outcast due to his agnostic beliefs and radical views. The town's intolerance of Miles's opinions highlights the restrictive nature of Gopher Prairie, making it easier for Will to consider leaving the town behind." />

    <node id="The reason Miles Bjornstam, or 'BJ,' is viewed as the &quot;town badman&quot; despite his attempts to fit in at social gatherings like church is due to his outspoken agnostic beliefs and radical views. His unfiltered criticism of Gopher Prairie and its inhabitants has made him a pariah in the community, with even Bea's Lutheran friends taking offense at his agnostic jokes and merchants being upset by his radical opinions.&#10;&#10;Despite trying to be accepted by attending church and sitting through sermons, BJ's radical beliefs set him apart from others. This highlights the narrow-mindedness of the townsfolk in Gopher Prairie who are unable to tolerate differing viewpoints or accept someone with unconventional beliefs. As a result, BJ remains an outcast and is viewed as the &quot;town badman&quot; by the community." />

    <node id="The speaker, Carol, is prevented from going out or engaging in activities as she usually prefers due to her feeling of tiredness. She has been overworking herself with housework, dealing with a slow learner maid, and taking care of her child, Hugh, who was whiny after being hot all afternoon. These responsibilities have worn her out, making her prefer to stay in and rest instead of going out." />
    <node id="Carol and Aunt Bessie have a conversation where they discuss their thoughts on Will Kennicott's potential interactions with other women. They both agree that Kennicott is simple-hearted when it comes to such matters, but Aunt Bessie expresses concern about the possibility of &quot;designing women&quot; tempting him. She mentions that as a doctor, he has many women coming to his office and implies that this could lead to improper relationships.&#10;&#10;Carol becomes angry at this suggestion and defends her husband, saying that he is too simple-hearted to hide anything from her. She also expresses the belief that if Kennicott were ever to be tempted by another woman, she hopes that he would have the spirit to do the tempting himself rather than being coaxed into it.&#10;&#10;Overall, both Carol and Aunt Bessie acknowledge Kennicott's simple nature, but they differ in their opinions on whether this makes him vulnerable to temptation from other women.

    <node id="While working on the addition to his house, Miles Bjornstam allowed Carol to handle all of the doctor's medical kit except for the saws. During this time, Miles spoke frankly to Carol and admitted that he would remain a social outcast in Gopher Prairie due to his agnostic jokes and radical views, which had offended many of the town's residents. He acknowledged that he found it difficult to keep his opinions to himself, which often led to others being offended.&#10;&#10;Miles also mentioned to Carol that his son would not go East to college and that he had been rebuffed by Vida Sherwin, leading to only a few neighbors attending his wife Bea and their baby Olaf's funeral. When the time for the funeral came, Carol was in bed and unable to attend as she was unaware of the situation due to her neighbors not telling her. She only discovered this when she saw Miles walking alone behind the hearse through her window.&#10;&#10;During their time working together, Karl and Carol traveled by freight-train to a convention in Joralemon. Although they had initially planned to take a passenger-train, their motor was out of order, and there was no passenger-train at an early hour. The journey on the freight-train provided an exciting and unusual experience for Carol as she enjoyed the slowness of the train and the feeling of being part of the lakes and wheat-fields they passed by. She liked the friendly independence of the men in the caboose, who were wearing blue silk kerchiefs, and appreciated the smell of hot earth and clean grease during the journey." />
    <node id="Carol's heightened sensitivity towards Kennicott during that midsummer month was due to her recalling various &quot;grotesqueries&quot; about him and reevaluating their relationship. She became aware of how patient he had been with her and began to appreciate his homely qualities, such as his handiness around the house and his boyishness when it came to his hobbies. However, she still saw him as lacking the glamor and unknown future of her previous idealized image of Hugh.&#10;&#10;The reason for Carol comparing Kennicott to Hugh, especially on a day of heat-lightning, was that they had not been able to move to their lake cottage due to the absence of the other doctors in town. This led to Carol feeling trapped and irritable in the heat, causing her to long for the freedom and excitement she associated with her time spent with Hugh before she was married. The day of heat-lightning served as a reminder of this and caused her to compare Kennicott unfavorably to her idealized image of Hugh." />

The baby curled in her lap, his head on her arm,&#10;listening with gravity while she sang from Gene Field:&#10;&#10;     'Tis little Luddy-Dud in the morning--&#10;     'Tis little Luddy-Dud at night:&#10;     And all day long&#10;     'Tis the same dear song&#10;     Of that growing, crowing, knowing little sprite.&#10;&#10;Kennicott was enchanted.&#10;&#10;&quot;Maud Dyer?

Carol had never been awake to the earth except as a show&#10;of changing color and great satisfying masses; she had lived in people&#10;and in ideas about having ideas; but Hugh's questions made her attentive&#10;to the comedies of sparrows, robins, blue jays, yellowhammers; she&#10;regained her pleasure in the arching flight of swallows, and added to it&#10;a solicitude about their nests and family squabbles.&#10;&#10;She forgot her seasons of boredom. She said to Hugh, &quot;We're two fat&#10;disreputable old minstrels roaming round the world,&quot; and he echoed her,&#10;&quot;Roamin' round--roamin' round.&quot;&#10;&#10;The high adventure, the secret place to which they both fled joyously,&#10;was the house of Miles and Bea and Olaf Bjornstam.&#10;&#10;Kennicott steadily disapproved of the Bjornstams. He protested, &quot;What&#10;do you want" />

She compares him unfavorably to another man, Bresnahan, who she feels would be more understanding and appreciative of her. This suggests a level of dissatisfaction in her marriage.&#10;&#10;During dinner, Carole observes the men around her, including her husband, engaging in coarse behavior such as noisily eating fish, spitting, smoking cigars, and using crude language. She feels disconnected from them and their world, which further exacerbates her feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;The observer's (Carole's) emotions in this scene are characterized by irritation, frustration, and a growing sense of alienation from those around her. The interactions between the individuals are marked by a lack of empathy and understanding, with the men engaging in boorish behavior while Carole feels increasingly isolated and marginalized.&#10;&#10;The observer's observations of her surroundings highlight the contrast between her delicate and refined world and the rough and unsophisticated behavior of the men around her. The stifling heat and the oppressive atmosphere of the dinner scene further contribute to Carole's feelings of discomfort and dissatisfaction, reinforcing her sense of alienation from those around her." />

She sat on the&#10;porch, rocking, fanning, twitchy with Hugh's whining.&#10;&#10;Kennicott came home, grumbled, &quot;What the devil is the kid yapping&#10;about?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I guess you can stand it ten minutes if I can stand it all day!&quot;&#10;&#10;He came to supper in his shirt sleeves, his vest partly open, revealing&#10;discolored suspenders.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why don't you put on your nice Palm Beach suit, and take off that&#10;hideous vest?&quot; she complained.&#10;&#10;&quot;Too much trouble.

And to Hugh, Olaf was lord among&#10;mortal men, less stalwart than the old monarch, King Miles, but more&#10;understanding of the relations and values of things, of small sticks,&#10;lone playing-cards, and irretrievably injured hoops.&#10;&#10;Carol saw, though she did not admit, that Olaf was not only more&#10;beautiful than her own dark child, but more gracious.

    <node id="Kennicott may be feeling restless because he is influenced by the overall atmosphere of the summer street fair, where people seem to be aimlessly wandering around and looking for entertainment. Additionally, his interaction with Calibree about going on the merry-go-round shows that he is hesitant and unsure, which could indicate a sense of restlessness or discomfort.&#10;&#10;Carol's lack of joviality can be attributed to her headache and her frustration with the monotonous routine of walking up and down the street. She had hoped to escape this dullness by going to their lake cottage, but they were unable to do so due to the absence of other doctors in town. The heat and the unenthusiastic response from the Calibrees may also contribute to her lack of joy. Furthermore, Carol's thoughts earlier in the day about Hugh and her idealized image of him could be making her compare Kennicott unfavorably to this image, leading to her dissatisfaction with the current situation." />

    <node id="After finishing his yard work, Kennicott is feeling restless and unsure of how to spend his time. He considers going on the merry-go-round but ultimately decides against it, perhaps due to a lack of enthusiasm or uncertainty about how Carol would react. Kennicott may be hesitant about Carol's reaction because he values her opinion and wants to make sure she approves of his actions. Additionally, he may feel self-conscious about engaging in leisure activities that could be perceived as childish or frivolous, especially if they are not aligned with Carol's interests or expectations for him.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Carol's fear about moving to the new house is that it may perpetuate her feeling of being trapped in a standardized life. She feels overwhelmed by housework, childcare, and the monotonous routine of small-town life, which has diminished her ambition and made her increasingly cynical and isolated. The prospect of moving to a new house, even though it is designed to be comfortable and functional, does not excite her because she fears that it will simply be another version of the same life.&#10;&#10;Carol sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they represent her husband's greater attention to practicality and his interest in the garage over other parts of the house, such as the sewing-room he plans for her. The garage doors symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles, which confine her to domestic responsibilities and limit her opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment. The image of prison doors suggests that she feels trapped in a life that does not allow her to express herself fully or use her talents and potential for practical matters and business skills, as suggested by her regret over not becoming a businesswoman.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's fear about moving to the new house is that it will perpetuate her feeling of being trapped in a standardized life, and she sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles." />
    <node id="The text does not provide explicit reasons for the Calibrees' hesitation to join Carol and Kennicott on a ride at the merry-go-round. However, Mrs. Calibree vaguely mentions that she doesn't believe she cares to much. This lack of enthusiasm might be due to fatigue, disinterest in carnival activities, or prior commitments. It is also possible that they abstain because they are not interested in appearing frivolous or unprofessional, as they are there to discuss medical matters with Kennicott." />
    <node id="The repetitive and mundane daily route that Carol Kennicott becomes familiar with in the small midwestern town consists of her housework and childcare responsibilities, as well as her social interactions with the town's residents. This includes tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for her son, as well as attending social events with other women in the town. Additionally, Carol often feels unchallenged and unfulfilled by these duties, leading to a growing sense of cynicism and isolation. The narrative highlights the monotony of her daily routine through descriptions of her trudging along the block of booths, trailing behind unsmiling companions, and experiencing physical discomfort from the repetitive nature of her work." />
    <node id="The person referred to as &quot;she&quot; in the text is Carol Kennicott, and there are a few reasons why she may be perceived as not particularly passionate or emotionally expressive. First, she is feeling overwhelmed by her responsibilities and the monotony of her life, which has made her increasingly cynical and isolated. This could make her seem less emotionally available or engaged with those around her. Additionally, she is compared unfavorably to another man, Bresnahan, who is perceived as more understanding and appreciative of her, suggesting that perhaps her husband Kennicott is not meeting her emotional needs in the way she would like.&#10;&#10;As for why the speaker (presumably Carol's husband, Kennicott) feels like an outsider in his own home despite being normal, this could be due to a variety of factors. One possibility is that he is not fully attuned to Carol's emotional state or needs, which can make her feel disconnected from him and the rest of the world. Additionally, the text suggests that there may be some misunderstandings in their relationship regarding her health concerns, which could create a sense of distance or disconnection between them. Finally, the garage doors that Carol sees as prison-like represent the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles, which may make her feel like she is living in a world that is not fully hers, leading to a sense of alienation even in her own home." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative and supporting materials, there are a few reasons why Kennicott may be hesitant to accept his friends' invitation to sneak off for an evening. Firstly, he has recently gotten married to Carol and may be trying to prioritize spending time with her and meeting her needs, as evidenced by his desire to ensure that she approves of his actions and interests.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Kennicott may feel self-conscious about engaging in activities that could be perceived as childish or frivolous, especially if they are not aligned with Carol's interests or expectations for him. This is suggested by his hesitation to go on the merry-go-round and his friends' vague reasons for declining the invitation, which may indicate a concern for professionalism or appearances.&#10;&#10;Lastly, it is possible that Kennicott is simply feeling content and comfortable in his married life and does not feel the need to engage in social activities outside of his relationship with Carol. He may have grown accustomed to the routine of married life and finds satisfaction in his work and time spent with his spouse.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there are several reasons why Kennicott may be hesitant to accept his friends' invitation, it is likely a combination of factors related to his new marriage, social expectations, and personal preferences." />
    <node id="based on the provided narrative, Carol's desire for alone time may be due to her overwhelming responsibilities and the monotony of her daily routine. She may feel exhausted and unfulfilled by her housework and childcare duties, as well as her social interactions with the town's residents. This could lead to a growing sense of cynicism and isolation, making her crave time alone to recharge and regain her emotional energy.&#10;&#10;Regarding her true feelings towards her loved ones, including her husband Kennicott, the narrative suggests that Carol may feel unappreciated or not fully understood by him. She is compared favorably to another man, Bresnahan, who is perceived as more understanding and appreciative of her, implying that perhaps Kennicott is not meeting her emotional needs in the way she would like. However, there is no explicit statement about Carol's feelings towards Kennicott or their relationship, so it is possible that she has mixed or complex emotions towards him that are not fully explored in the narrative. Ultimately, more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion about Carol's true feelings towards her loved ones." />

While she finds solace in reading and values her work, she rejects the idea of being praised for labor and feels a growing distance from those around her, including her husband and friends.&#10;&#10;If Carol continues down this path, she may become more and more like the old eccentric woman she fears becoming – an embittered recluse who despises her town and its inhabitants. She may lose touch with her former talents and potential for practical matters and business skills, as suggested by her regret over not becoming a businesswoman. This could lead to a life of unfulfilled dreams and increasing isolation, ultimately impacting her mental and emotional well-being.&#10;&#10;To avoid this fate, Carol should consider finding healthier coping mechanisms beyond reading and seek support from those around her, like Mrs. Westlake, who understands her struggles. Exploring new opportunities within the community or pursuing her interests could also help rekindle her ambition and prevent further disillusionment.">

She feels overwhelmed by housework, childcare, and the monotonous routine of small-town life, which has diminished her ambition and made her increasingly cynical and isolated. The prospect of moving to a new house, even though it is designed to be comfortable and functional, does not excite her because she fears that it will simply be another version of the same life.&#10;&#10;Carol sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they represent her husband's greater attention to practicality and his interest in the garage over other parts of the house, such as the sewing-room he plans for her. The garage doors symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles, which confine her to domestic responsibilities and limit her opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment.

She notes that he is preoccupied and not fully engaged in their conversation, as he often becomes engrossed in story-books and fails to tend to business matters promptly. This observation causes a feeling of alienation in Carol, who craves more romantic involvement from her husband.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol reflects on Kennicott's appearance, mentioning that she doesn't find him romantic enough. She also comments on his clothing, stating that his hunting-coat is worn and unattractive, which further emphasizes the disparity between her expectations and reality. The coat is described as being patched with grease from gun-cleaning, hanging in a border of rags, something Carol despises.&#10;&#10;Carol's observations about Kennicott and his appearance during supper make her question the monotony of her daily life, causing her to reconsider the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home she once regarded as the basis of all decent life. She wonders whether millions of women have lied to themselves about enjoying housework and suspects that there might be a better way to organize family life.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's realizations highlight the discrepancy between her idealized expectations of married life with Kennicott and the reality of their relationship. This revelation leads her to question societal norms and seek new ways to improve her daily experiences.">

This suggests that he may sometimes perceive his wife's concerns as exaggerated or unfounded, which could potentially lead to misunderstandings in their relationship.&#10;&#10;Regarding fidelity and limitations placed on him by it, the text does not provide explicit information about Will's thoughts.

The text does not provide clear insight into his thoughts on the limitations of fidelity, but there is a subtle suggestion of an intimate moment between him and Carol, another married woman.">

This observation causes a feeling of alienation in Carol, who craves more romantic involvement from her husband.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol reflects on Kennicott's appearance, mentioning that she doesn't find him romantic enough. She also comments on his clothing, stating that his hunting-coat is worn and unattractive, which further emphasizes the disparity between her expectations and reality. The coat is described as being patched with grease from gun-cleaning, hanging in a border of rags, something Carol despises.&#10;&#10;Carol's observations about Kennicott and his appearance during supper make her question the monotony of her daily life, causing her to reconsider the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home she once regarded as the basis of all decent life. She wonders whether millions of women have lied to themselves about enjoying housework and suspects that there might be a better way to organize family life.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's realizations highlight the discrepancy between her idealized expectations of married life with Kennicott and the reality of their relationship. This revelation leads her to question societal norms and seek new ways to improve her daily experiences.">

She compares him unfavorably to another man, Bresnahan, who she feels would be more understanding and appreciative of her. This suggests a level of dissatisfaction in her marriage.&#10;&#10;During dinner, Carole observes the men around her, including her husband, engaging in coarse behavior such as noisily eating fish, spitting, smoking cigars, and using crude language. She feels disconnected from them and their world, which further exacerbates her feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;The observer's (Carole's) emotions in this scene are characterized by irritation, frustration, and a growing sense of alienation from those around her. The interactions between the individuals are marked by a lack of empathy and understanding, with the men engaging in boorish behavior while Carole feels increasingly isolated and marginalized.&#10;&#10;The observer's observations of her surroundings highlight the contrast between her delicate and refined world and the rough and unsophisticated behavior of the men around her. The stifling heat and the oppressive atmosphere of the dinner scene further contribute to Carole's feelings of discomfort and dissatisfaction, reinforcing her sense of alienation from those around her.">

However, she still saw him as lacking the glamor and unknown future of her previous idealized image of Hugh.&#10;&#10;The reason for Carol comparing Kennicott to Hugh, especially on a day of heat-lightning, was that they had not been able to move to their lake cottage due to the absence of the other doctors in town.

She notes that he is preoccupied and not fully engaged in their conversation, as he often becomes engrossed in story-books and fails to tend to business matters promptly. This observation causes a feeling of alienation in Carol, who craves more romantic involvement from her husband.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol reflects on Kennicott's appearance, mentioning that she doesn't find him romantic enough. She also comments on his clothing, stating that his hunting-coat is worn and unattractive, which further emphasizes the disparity between her expectations and reality. The coat is described as being patched with grease from gun-cleaning, hanging in a border of rags, something Carol despises.&#10;&#10;Carol's observations about Kennicott and his appearance during supper make her question the monotony of her daily life, causing her to reconsider the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home she once regarded as the basis of all decent life. She wonders whether millions of women have lied to themselves about enjoying housework and suspects that there might be a better way to organize family life.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's realizations highlight the discrepancy between her idealized expectations of married life with Kennicott and the reality of their relationship. This revelation leads her to question societal norms and seek new ways to improve her daily experiences." target="The speaker, Carol, is prevented from going out or engaging in activities as she usually prefers due to her feeling of tiredness. She has been overworking herself with housework, dealing with a slow learner maid, and taking care of her child, Hugh, who was whiny after being hot all afternoon. These responsibilities have worn her out, making her prefer to stay in and rest instead of going out.">

She feels overwhelmed by housework, childcare, and the monotonous routine of small-town life, which has diminished her ambition and made her increasingly cynical and isolated. The prospect of moving to a new house, even though it is designed to be comfortable and functional, does not excite her because she fears that it will simply be another version of the same life.&#10;&#10;Carol sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they represent her husband's greater attention to practicality and his interest in the garage over other parts of the house, such as the sewing-room he plans for her. The garage doors symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles, which confine her to domestic responsibilities and limit her opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment. The image of prison doors suggests that she feels trapped in a life that does not allow her to express herself fully or use her talents and potential for practical matters and business skills, as suggested by her regret over not becoming a businesswoman.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's fear about moving to the new house is that it will perpetuate her feeling of being trapped in a standardized life, and she sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative, Carol's fear about moving to the new house is that it may perpetuate her feeling of being trapped in a standardized life. She feels overwhelmed by housework, childcare, and the monotonous routine of small-town life, which has diminished her ambition and made her increasingly cynical and isolated. The prospect of moving to a new house, even though it is designed to be comfortable and functional, does not excite her because she fears that it will simply be another version of the same life.&#10;&#10;Carol sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they represent her husband's greater attention to practicality and his interest in the garage over other parts of the house, such as the sewing-room he plans for her. The garage doors symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles, which confine her to domestic responsibilities and limit her opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment. The image of prison doors suggests that she feels trapped in a life that does not allow her to express herself fully or use her talents and potential for practical matters and business skills, as suggested by her regret over not becoming a businesswoman.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's fear about moving to the new house is that it will perpetuate her feeling of being trapped in a standardized life, and she sees the prospective garage doors as prison-like because they symbolize the limitations placed on her life by societal expectations and gender roles." target="The person referred to as &quot;she&quot; in the text is Carol Kennicott, and there are a few reasons why she may be perceived as not particularly passionate or emotionally expressive.

One possibility is that he is not fully attuned to Carol's emotional state or needs, which can make her feel disconnected from him and the rest of the world. Additionally, the text suggests that there may be some misunderstandings in their relationship regarding her health concerns, which could create a sense of distance or disconnection between them.

    <node id="Marianne Dashwood's behavior towards Colonel Brandon changes significantly after she learns of Willoughby's guilt. Initially, Marianne speaks to Colonel Brandon with a kind of compassionate respect, shows no signs of avoiding him, and even voluntarily talks to him. This change in behavior indicates that she no longer sees Colonel Brandon as a rival for Willoughby's affections but begins to appreciate his genuine character.&#10;&#10;The transformation in Marianne's attitude is likely due to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Disappointment and disillusionment with Willoughby: Once Marianne discovers Willoughby's true nature, she becomes more receptive to Colonel Brandon's kindness and admirable qualities.&#10;2. Sense of guilt for misjudging Colonel Brandon: As Marianne learns about Willoughby's deceitful behavior, she may feel remorse for having unfairly judged Colonel Brandon based on her infatuation with Willoughby.&#10;3. Maturity and self-awareness: The painful experience with Willoughby could have prompted Marianne to become more aware of her own emotions and actions, leading her to treat others, including Colonel Brandon, with greater consideration and respect.&#10;&#10;Overall, the revelation of Willoughby's guilt allows Marianne to grow emotionally and reassess her relationships, eventually leading her to appreciate Colonel Brandon's true worth." />

Her mind did&#10;become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.  She felt the&#10;loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the&#10;loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the&#10;misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE&#10;have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that&#10;she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor;&#10;and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister&#10;than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent&#10;confession of them.&#10;&#10;To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and&#10;answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what&#10;her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly&#10;less painful than Marianne's, and an" />

Not that Marianne&#10;appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to&#10;it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither&#10;objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and&#10;seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible.  But&#10;though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt&#10;WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the&#10;effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,&#10;in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of&#10;compassionate respect, and though" />

Mrs. Jennings was&#10;not struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked&#10;across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--&#10;&quot;The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows nothing of it;&#10;do tell him, my dear.&quot;&#10;&#10;He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look&#10;which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her&#10;sister.&#10;&#10;&quot;Marianne is not well,&quot; said she.  &quot;She has been indisposed all day,&#10;and we have persuaded her to go to bed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps, then,&quot; he hesitatingly replied, &quot;what I heard this morning&#10;may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at&#10;first.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What did you hear?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That" />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the&#10;tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was&#10;necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure&#10;while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss&#10;Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel&#10;Brandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of&#10;hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening&#10;more serious and thoughtful than usual.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the&#10;next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had&#10;closed her eyes.&#10;&#10;Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and&#10;before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and&#10;again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on&#10;Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on&#10;Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as&#10;unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others," />
    <node id="&#10;barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Marianne, in no possible way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long it&#10;may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is&#10;she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and&#10;attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--he&#10;talked to me only of myself.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.&#10;&#10;&quot;Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we be&#10;gone to-morrow?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow, Marianne!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake--and&#10;now who cares for me? Who regards me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more&#10;than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a&#10;hasty removal as that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />

I thought we HAD been&#10;safe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne moved to the window--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is Colonel Brandon!&quot; said she, with vexation.  &quot;We are never safe&#10;from HIM.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not trust to THAT,&quot; retreating to her own room.  &quot;A man who has&#10;nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on&#10;that of others.&quot;&#10;&#10;The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on&#10;injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who&#10;was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him" />
    <node id="Miss Dashwood's letter from John Willoughby reveals the true nature of his character, leading her to view him as a &quot;hardened villain&quot; and feel bitter towards him. In the letter, Willoughby confesses his inconstancy and inability to maintain his commitment to Miss Dashwood, while also acknowledging that he has long had his affections engaged elsewhere. He further demonstrates his lack of honor and decorum by sending such a crude and insulting message, which fails to show any remorse or regret for the pain caused. The letter confirms Miss Dashwood's suspicions about Willoughby's untrustworthy character and causes her to feel indignation towards him, as well as bitterness for having been deceived by his false promises and deceitful behavior." />
    <node id="     &quot;JOHN WILLOUGHBY.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss&#10;Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she began it, that it&#10;must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their&#10;separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be&#10;suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable&#10;of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and&#10;delicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to&#10;send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing&#10;with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no&#10;breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter of&#10;which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be&#10;deep in hardened villainy.&#10;&#10;She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read&#10;it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her&#10;abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,&#10;that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound&#10;Marianne still" />

That I should ever have meant more&#10;     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand&#10;     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,&#10;     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before&#10;     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great&#10;     regret that I obey your commands in returning the&#10;     letters with which I have been honoured from you,&#10;     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed&#10;     on me.&#10;&#10;     &quot;I am, dear Madam,&#10;               &quot;Your most obedient&#10;                    &quot;humble servant,&#10;                                        &quot;JOHN WILLOUGHBY.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss&#10;Dashwood, may be imagined" />
    <node id=" would be only to give a repetition of what&#10;her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly&#10;less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than&#10;Elinor's.  Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,&#10;arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her&#10;anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with&#10;fortitude under this misfortune.  Bad indeed must the nature of&#10;Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!&#10;mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which&#10;SHE could wish her not to indulge!&#10;&#10;Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had&#10;determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at&#10;that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be&#10;bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by&#10;constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen&#10;him there.  She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all&#10;means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which," />

Little did Mr. Willoughby&#10;imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in&#10;breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom&#10;he had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have&#10;availed?  Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of&#10;your sister?  No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel&#10;for another would do.  He had left the girl whose youth and innocence&#10;he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no&#10;creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!

    <node id="Marianne's distress is due to her unrequited love for John Willoughby, who has rejected her after leading her on. She is in despair and can't imagine how Elinor, who is loved by Edward Ferrars, could understand her suffering. Elinor responds to her sister's suffering with compassion and tries to help Marianne see that she must exert herself and think of their mother's feelings in her time of grief. However, Marianne is inconsolable and believes that Elinor is much happier because she is loved by Edward.&#10;&#10;Elinor, who has been keeping her own romantic disappointment a secret from Marianne, can't bring herself to correct her sister's misconception about her happiness. Instead, she lets Lucy, Edward's younger sister and secret fiancée, reprimand Marianne for her impertinence, which spares Elinor the trouble of checking her sister's behavior herself.&#10;&#10;The source of Marianne's distress is her heartbreak over Willoughby, who has callously rejected her after leading her on and stringing her along with false promises of love and marriage. She is overwhelmed by grief and can't imagine how Elinor, who seems to have everything she wants, could understand her suffering.&#10;&#10;Elinor responds to her sister's distress with compassion and tries to help her see that she must exert herself and think of their mother's feelings in her time of grief. She encourages Marianne to be strong and to remember that their mother is also suffering because of Willoughby's rejection. However, Marianne is inconsolable and can only focus on her own pain and heartbreak.&#10;&#10;Elinor's response to her sister's suffering highlights the contrast between their views on love and happiness. While Marianne believes that true love must be passionate and all-consuming, Elinor takes a more practical view of romantic relationships and believes that they require compromise and selflessness. Despite her own heartbreak, Elinor puts aside her own feelings to help Marianne through her time of need, demonstrating her deep love and concern for her sister's well-being." />
    <node id=" in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.&#10;Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne&#10;to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of&#10;patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she&#10;obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy&#10;till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;&#10;and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for&#10;the rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the&#10;pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's&#10;letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then&#10;sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat&#10;her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the&#10;drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table&#10;where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over&#10;her for the hardship of such a" />

Elinor, I am&#10;miserable, indeed,&quot; before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.&#10;&#10;Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in&#10;silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;Exert yourself, dear Marianne,&quot; she cried, &quot;if you would not kill&#10;yourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother; think of her&#10;misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot, I cannot,&quot; cried Marianne; &quot;leave me, leave me, if I&#10;distress you" />

But the letter, when she was&#10;calm enough to read it, brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled&#10;every page.  Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and&#10;relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by&#10;Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards&#10;them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection&#10;for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each&#10;other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.&#10;&#10;All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was&#10;dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken&#10;confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.&#10;Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne&#10;to" />

He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than&#10;Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe&#10;her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and&#10;asked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of all&#10;presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  But&#10;the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed.  Her face was&#10;crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,&#10;&quot;Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you not&#10;received my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?&quot;&#10;&#10;He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he&#10;held her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidently&#10;struggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw" />
    <node id="The effect of Miss Dashwood's communication to Colonel Brandon about Marianne's situation is that he becomes aware of her absence due to her disappointment and disillusionment with Willoughby. However, instead of being cheerful or glad as Mrs. Jennings expected, Colonel Brandon remains serious and thoughtful throughout the evening. The reason for his continued gravity could be attributed to his empathetic nature, as he genuinely cares for Marianne's well-being and feels for her distress.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Miss Dashwood's revelation might have reinforced Colonel Brandon's concerns about Marianne's relationship with Willoughby, whom he knows to be unworthy of her affections and capable of causing her pain. This information could also lead him to reflect on his own feelings towards Marianne and the possible implications for his future actions. Furthermore, Colonel Brandon might not want to appear overly cheerful or intrusive in light of Marianne's situation, which could explain his serious demeanor." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Mr. Willoughby has been intimate with Elinor Dashwood's sister, Marianne, and has even taken her to Allenham House, suggesting a plan for their future life together. However, he has not explicitly become engaged to Marianne. Later, it is revealed that Mr. Willoughby is going to marry another woman, Miss Grey, who is known to be connected to him. Despite his actions and promises, Mr. Willoughby left Marianne in a distressed state and did not return or relieve her situation. This leads Elinor to believe that he never was truly attached to Marianne." />

After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,&#10;with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be&#10;all the better for Colonel Brandon.

    <node id="  In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think&quot;--he stopped&#10;a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, &quot;And&#10;your sister--how did she--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her sufferings have been very severe.

Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;&#10;and even now, perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was&#10;really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and, in some&#10;points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah!&quot; said Colonel Brandon, &quot;there is, indeed!

I do assure you that nothing would surprise me&#10;more than to hear of their being going to be married.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Don't we&#10;all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in&#10;love with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I see&#10;them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I&#10;know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding&#10;clothes?  Come, come, this won't do.

Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to have&#10;been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded&#10;it to us.  Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladies&#10;were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other&#10;an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting&#10;concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all.

    <node id="1. What had caused Edward's feelings for Lucy to change: The narrative does not provide explicit information on what caused Edward's feelings for Lucy to change. However, it can be inferred that as he spent more time with the Dashwood sisters and got to know Elinor better, his initial infatuation with Lucy might have faded, allowing him to see her true character and intentions.&#10;2. Why does Marianne believe that some form of trickery must have been involved: Marianne finds it hard to accept that Willoughby could intentionally hurt her sister without any justification. Therefore, she assumes that someone must have instigated him against Elinor, possibly Lucy or other people in their social circle. This belief reflects Marianne's romantic view of the world, where she struggles to accept that people can act maliciously without any apparent reason." />
    <node id=" of great consolation to her, that what brought evil&#10;to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other&#10;hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward&#10;entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay&#10;would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better&#10;for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.&#10;&#10;Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's&#10;name mentioned, was not thrown away.  Marianne, though without knowing&#10;it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor&#10;Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.&#10;Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards&#10;herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day&#10;after day to the indignation of them all.&#10;&#10;Sir John, could not have thought it possible.  &quot;A man of whom he had&#10;always had such reason to think well!  Such a good-natured fellow!  He&#10;did not believe there was a bolder rider in England!  It was an&#10;unaccountable business" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10;&#10;For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had&#10;passed away, she added, in a firmer tone,&#10;&#10;&quot;Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he have been&#10;instigated?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;By all the world, rather than by his own heart.  I could rather&#10;believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me&#10;in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty.  This&#10;woman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your&#10;own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.&#10;Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not&#10;rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor would not contend, and only replied, &quot;Whoever may have been so&#10;detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,&#10;my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own&#10;" />
    <node id="stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which&#10;seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented&#10;her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with&#10;the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that&#10;would bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his regard, and&#10;convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a&#10;regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.&#10;&#10;As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already&#10;have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in&#10;its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest&#10;concern.  Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she&#10;could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in&#10;future, her mind might be always supported.  But every circumstance&#10;that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery&#10;of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and&#10;irreconcilable rupture with him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or" />
    <node id="1. Marianne is no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he calls and even speaks to him voluntarily with a kind of compassionate respect. However, this change in behavior does not indicate an improvement in her overall emotional state.&#10;2. Marianne feels wretched due to the loss of Willoughby's character, as she has discovered his deceitful behavior towards Miss Williams and possibly herself. This realization has led to a gloomy dejection that has settled in her mind.&#10;3. The sorrow she experiences is so profound that she cannot bring herself to speak about it even to Elinor, her closest sister. Marianne keeps her feelings to herself, which causes more pain for Elinor than if Marianne had openly and frequently confessed her emotions.&#10;4. The revelation of Willoughby's guilt has led to a significant change in Marianne's perception of Colonel Brandon. She no longer sees him as a rival but begins to appreciate his genuine character, showing compassionate respect towards him.&#10;5. Elinor, who is aware of her sister's suffering, offers no counsel of her own except to wait for their mother's wishes regarding Marianne's future actions. This situation demonstrates Elinor's patience and understanding in dealing with her sister's emotional turmoil." />
    <node id="Eliza, who was a close relation to the speaker and had been under his guardianship since she was three years old, was married against her inclination to the speaker's brother. This occurred when Eliza was seventeen, and it happened because she had a large fortune and the family estate was encumbered. The speaker, who loved Eliza deeply, had hoped that her regard for him would help her endure any difficulty in her marriage. However, his brother did not deserve or love Eliza, and he treated her unkindly.&#10;&#10;The young and inexperienced Mrs. Brandon resigned herself to the misery of her situation at first, but eventually fell into inconstancy due to the lack of a friend to advise or restrain her and the provocation of an unfaithful husband. The speaker had procured his exchange and left for the East Indies with the hope of promoting the happiness of both Eliza and himself by removing from her for years. However, he was shocked when he heard about her divorce two years later and feared that she might have fallen victim to some dishonorable designs from her husband.&#10;&#10;The speaker then tells Elinor that he believes that Mrs. Brandon, upon hearing the wretched situation of Eliza and comparing it with her own, will realize how fortunate she is and feel less regret over her own situation. The speaker requests that Elinor use her discretion in communicating this to Mrs. Brandon, as it might be of service in lessening her regrets.&#10;&#10;It was revealed later in the narrative that Eliza had promised the speaker that nothing would prevent their elopement together to Scotland, but his cousin's maid betrayed them. The speaker was banished to a distant relative's house, and Eliza was not allowed any liberty, society, or amusement until her father's point was gained. The speaker had depended on Eliza's fortitude too far, and the blow of their thwarted elopement and subsequent marriage of Eliza to his brother was severe. However, if her marriage had been happy, a few months might have reconciled him to it." />

But to what does all this lead?  I seem to have been distressing&#10;you for nothing.  Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched&#10;for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!  I WILL be&#10;more collected--more concise.  She left to my care her only child, a&#10;little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then&#10;about three years old.  She loved the child, and had always kept it&#10;with her.  It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I&#10;have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her&#10;education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I&#10;had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at&#10;school.  I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my&#10;brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the&#10;possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaf" />
    <node id=" lady was one of my nearest relations, an&#10;orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.  Our&#10;ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were&#10;playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the time when I did not&#10;love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as&#10;perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you&#10;might think me incapable of having ever felt.  Hers, for me, was, I&#10;believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and&#10;it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  At&#10;seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was married--married&#10;against her inclination to my brother.  Her fortune was large, and our&#10;family estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can be&#10;said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.&#10;My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.  I had hoped&#10;that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for&#10;some time it" />
    <node id=" the&#10;case.  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what&#10;they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly.&#10;The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so&#10;inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resigned&#10;herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it&#10;been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the&#10;remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such a&#10;husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or&#10;restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their&#10;marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should&#10;fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the&#10;happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose&#10;had procured my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,&quot;&#10;he continued, in a voice of great agitation, &quot;was of trifling&#10;weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years&#10;afterwards, of her divorce" />

Surely this comparison must have its use&#10;with her.  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They&#10;proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the&#10;contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.&#10;Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it,&#10;must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, in&#10;communicating to her what I have told you.

I have&#10;never told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours of&#10;eloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of my&#10;cousin's maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relation&#10;far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,&#10;till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude too&#10;far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so&#10;young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at&#10;least I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not the&#10;case.  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what&#10;they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Elinor's sister, Marianne, is in a distressed state due to being abandoned by Mr. Willoughby, who she thought had serious intentions towards her. They had spent time together at Allenham House, which suggested a plan for their future life together. However, Mr. Willoughby later decided to marry another woman, Miss Grey, leaving Marianne in despair.&#10;&#10;Marianne finds it difficult to accept that Willoughby intentionally hurt her and believes that someone must have instigated him against her, possibly Lucy or other people in their social circle. This reflects Marianne's romantic view of the world, as she struggles to accept that people can act maliciously without any apparent reason.&#10;&#10;However, Elinor, who has a more practical perspective, believes that Willoughby never truly cared for Marianne and is surprised by her sister's reluctance to acknowledge this fact. Eventually, Marianne accepts the truth and concludes that &quot;I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.&quot; She finds it hard to believe that Willoughby could intentionally hurt her and instead blames others for instigating him against her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Elinor's sister, Marianne, has been abandoned by Mr. Willoughby, leaving her in a state of distress and disbelief. She initially finds it hard to accept that he never truly cared for her and suspects that someone must have instigated him against her. However, she eventually comes to terms with the situation and acknowledges that she has been cruelly used by Willoughby himself. Elinor, who has a more practical perspective, is not surprised by Mr. Willoughby's actions and believes that he never truly cared for Marianne." />
    <node id="  Elinor was employed in walking&#10;thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,&#10;without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning&#10;objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,&#10;with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up&#10;Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,&#10;exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!&#10;Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whatever&#10;he might have heard against me--ought he not to have suspended his&#10;belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power&#10;of clearing myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)&#10;which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.&#10;Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,&#10;barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Marianne, in no possible way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Colonel Brandon did not display any instantaneous gaiety after learning about Miss Dashwood's feelings because his response to her situation was likely influenced by his empathetic nature and genuine concern for her well-being. Additionally, he might have been reflecting on his own feelings towards Marianne, which could have contributed to his continued serious demeanor. Moreover, Colonel Brandon might not have wanted to appear overly cheerful or intrusive in light of Marianne's distress.&#10;   &#10;2. Marianne continues to feel miserable the next morning because she is struggling to come to terms with Willoughby's betrayal and the loss of her idealized image of him. The revelation of his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, as well as his intention to marry another woman, has deeply affected her, causing her to question not only their relationship but also herself. Furthermore, she is unable to speak about her feelings with Elinor, which contributes to her &quot;gloomy dejection.&quot;" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Elinor is grieving over the imprudent letters written by Willoughby to Marianne due to their inappropriate nature. Although Elinor strongly disapproves of Willoughby's behavior and believes he does not truly care for her sister, she recognizes the impropriety of these love letters. These unsolicited expressions of tenderness, which lack proper justification or precedent, expose both Marianne and Willoughby to unnecessary pain and embarrassment, particularly in light of his hasty engagement to Miss Grey. Elinor silently mourns the imprudence that led to such letters, recognizing the regret and suffering they have caused her sister and their family." />

But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the&#10;impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silently&#10;grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs&#10;of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely&#10;condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished&#10;the letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any&#10;one would have written in the same situation.&#10;&#10;&quot;I felt myself,&quot; she added, &quot;to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if&#10;the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each" />
    <node id="1. The narrative does not provide explicit information on what caused Edward's feelings for Lucy to change. However, it can be inferred that as he spent more time with the Dashwood sisters and got to know Elinor better, his initial infatuation with Lucy might have faded, allowing him to see her true character and intentions.&#10;2. Marianne believes that some form of deceit must have been involved in Willoughby's decision to leave her for another woman because she finds it hard to accept that he could intentionally hurt her without any justification.

However, it can be inferred that as he spent more time with the Dashwood sisters and got to know Elinor better, his initial infatuation with Lucy might have faded, allowing him to see her true character and intentions.&#10;&#10;The supporting material 1 also mentions that Edward's feelings for Lucy may have changed due to him getting to know Elinor better and seeing Lucy's true character and intentions. As Edward spends more time with the Dashwood sisters, he might have developed feelings for Elinor, leading him to reconsider his relationship with Lucy.&#10;&#10;Without further information from the narrative, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer as to what caused Edward's feelings for Lucy to change. However, the inference can be made that his growing affection for Elinor and his disillusionment with Lucy played a significant role in this shift." />
    <node id="1. The signs that Marianne is struggling with strong emotions before saying goodbye to Willoughby include her eagerness to leave as soon as possible and her fixation on watching Elinor write the letter to their mother about what had happened. These actions indicate Marianne's distress and inability to fully process or express her feelings.&#10;2. Elinor tries to help her sister in their last moments together by offering no counsel of her own except for patience till their mother's wishes could be known, ultimately obtaining Marianne's consent to wait for that knowledge. In this situation, Elinor demonstrates her understanding and patient approach in dealing with Marianne's emotional turmoil." />
    <node id="From the provided text, it can be inferred that Elinor Dashwood has a negative opinion of John Willoughby. This is evident when she reads Marianne's letters detailing her relationship with Willoughby. Elinor disapproves of his behavior towards Marianne and believes he does not truly care for her sister, as shown by his hasty engagement to Miss Grey and the inappropriate love letters he wrote to Marianne. Elinor recognizes that these imprudent expressions of tenderness cause unnecessary pain and embarrassment for both Marianne and Willoughby, leading her to silently mourn the regret and suffering they have caused her sister and their family. Therefore, it is clear that Elinor has a strained and distrustful relationship with Willoughby based on his actions towards her sister." />
    <node id="1. Marianne was motivated to dine with her sister despite Elinor's advice due to her desire to minimize the bustle around her as she coped with her emotional turmoil. She wanted some semblance of normalcy, even if it meant participating in a family dinner.&#10;2. Marianne managed to maintain an unexpected calmness during the dinner by remaining largely detached from her surroundings. Her fixation on her thoughts and ignoring everything happening around her helped preserve this calmness, as she was not drawn into conversations or interactions that might have otherwise distressed her further." />
    <node id="Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with&#10;them.  Elinor even advised her against it.  But &quot;no, she would go down;&#10;she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.&quot;&#10;Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,&#10;though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,&#10;said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,&#10;while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into&#10;the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.&#10;&#10;When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer&#10;than her sister had expected.  Had she tried to speak, or had she been&#10;conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions&#10;to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a&#10;syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts&#10;preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.&#10;&#10;Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its&#10;effusions were" />
    <node id="1. Marianne became agitated and insistent on leaving the card party because she spotted Willoughby in attendance, engaging in conversation with another woman. This sight upset her greatly, as it served as a painful reminder of his betrayal and left her feeling vulnerable amidst the crowd of people. The narrative mentions that Elinor &quot;perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman&quot; and that he &quot;could not but see her [Marianne].&quot; This revelation distresses Marianne, and she implores her sister to request that Lady Middleton take them home immediately." />
    <node id="With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him&#10;herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,&#10;with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more&#10;privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued&#10;incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,&#10;by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby&#10;quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne&#10;that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that&#10;evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.  She instantly begged&#10;her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was&#10;too miserable to stay a minute longer.&#10;&#10;Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed&#10;that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her&#10;wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they&#10;departed as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word was&#10;spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in" />

When they had paid their tribute of&#10;politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted&#10;to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and&#10;inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some&#10;time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to&#10;Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and&#10;Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great&#10;distance from the table.&#10;&#10;They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived&#10;Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest&#10;conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She soon&#10;caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to&#10;speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor&#10;regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby&#10;neither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that time&#10;to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept&#10;away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,&#10;Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming&#10;equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one&#10;look of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the&#10;drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's&#10;arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude,&#10;lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; and&#10;when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the&#10;door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.&#10;&#10;They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as&#10;the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the&#10;stairs, heard their names announced from" />

This allows Elinor to maintain her composure and civility while declining Miss Steele's proposal to visit Marianne." />

My sister will be equally sorry to miss the&#10;pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with&#10;nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and&#10;me!--I think she might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.  Her sister was&#10;perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore&#10;not able to come to them.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, if that's all,&quot; cried Miss Steele, &quot;we can just as well go and see&#10;HER.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she&#10;was saved the" />

I&#10;am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her&#10;self-command to make it appear that she did NOT.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, &quot;and how did you travel?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not in the stage, I assure you,&quot; replied Miss Steele, with quick&#10;exultation; &quot;we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to&#10;attend us. " />
    <node id="Marianne's reaction to reading her mother's letter is one of distress and urgency to return home. The letter, filled with her mother's mistaken confidence in Willoughby's constancy and the belief in their future happiness together, only intensifies Marianne's pain. She becomes wildly urgent to be gone, as his inappropriate love letters and her mother's blind trust in him are a reproach that brings little comfort. The contrast between her romanticized view of Willoughby and the reality of his actions deepens her emotional turmoil, making her long for the solace of her home and the comfort of her dear mother." />
    <node id="1. Elinor is hesitant to allow Miss Steele and Mrs. Jennings to visit her sick sister, Marianne, because she believes that Marianne is not in a state to receive visitors. Marianne had been suffering from nervous headaches and had secluded herself in her room. Elinor politely declines their proposal by implying that Marianne may be resting or undressed, making it impossible for her to meet the guests. Additionally, Elinor might worry that visitors could exhaust Marianne, given her fragile health condition, and she wants to protect her sister from any unnecessary stress or discomfort." />
    <node id="Marianne Dashwood's disappointment and astonishment are caused by John Willoughby's unexpected and cold behavior during their encounter. She had sent him notes informing him of her arrival in town, but he did not acknowledge receiving them. Instead, he acted as if he was unaware of their intended meetings and made no effort to explain the situation. Marianne is confused by this strange behavior and demands an explanation, asking Willoughby what could be the meaning of his actions. In her note, she is requesting clarification about why he is behaving in such a distant manner towards her." />
    <node id=" her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidently&#10;struggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw its&#10;expression becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spoke&#10;with calmness.&#10;&#10;&quot;I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,&#10;and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find&#10;yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But have you not received my notes?&quot; cried Marianne in the wildest&#10;anxiety.  &quot;Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake.  What&#10;can be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell&#10;me, what is the matter?&quot;&#10;&#10;He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment&#10;returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he&#10;had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,&#10;he recovered himself again, and after saying, &quot;Yes, I had the pleasure&#10;of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so&#10;good as to send me,&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Marianne wants to leave the card party immediately because she spots Willoughby there, engaged in conversation with another woman. This sight upsets her greatly as it serves as a painful reminder of his betrayal and leaves her feeling vulnerable amidst the crowd of people. She implores her sister Elinor to request that Lady Middleton take them home immediately.&#10;2. In response to this situation, Elinor plans to write to their mother for advice on how to handle the situation. She is aware of the pain she is going to communicate and perceives by Marianne's letter how ill she has succeeded in laying any foundation for it. Elinor offers no counsel of her own except for patience till their mother's wishes can be known, ultimately obtaining Marianne's consent to wait for that knowledge." />
    <node id="1. In this narrative, &quot;he&quot; refers to Willoughby, who is the former love interest of Marianne Dashwood. Marianne's reaction to his presence is very strong because she had developed a deep emotional connection with him and was expecting to marry him. However, Willoughby suddenly left her for another woman, causing Marianne immense pain and heartbreak.&#10;2. Elinor and Marianne are reacting to Willoughby's unexpected appearance in London, where he had come to attend a social event with his new fiancée. Marianne is shocked and distressed by this encounter, as she struggles to understand why Willoughby would intentionally hurt her. Elinor, on the other hand, tries to remain calm and supportive of her sister while also protecting her from any unnecessary stress or discomfort caused by visitors.&#10;&#10;In summary, Elinor and Marianne are reacting to Willoughby's presence in London after he had left Marianne for another woman. Marianne's reaction is very strong due to the deep emotional connection she had developed with him and her difficulty in accepting his intentional hurt towards her." />
    <node id="1. Why was Marianne oblivious to Willoughby's name in the narrative?&#10;Marianne's obliviousness to Willoughby's name can be attributed to her emotional state, as she was deeply absorbed in her own thoughts and feelings. After learning about Willoughby's engagement to Miss Grey, Marianne fell into a state of despair, which caused her to distance herself from the world around her, including any mention of Willoughby's name.&#10;2. Why did Elinor shield her sister from hearing about him?&#10;Elinor took measures to prevent Marianne from hearing about Willoughby because she wanted to protect her sister from further pain and disappointment. Knowing how deeply Marianne cared for Willoughby, Elinor feared that hearing his name or learning about his engagement would cause even more distress and heartache. By shielding her sister from such information, Elinor hoped to minimize the emotional impact on Marianne's already fragile state of mind.&#10;3. Why did Sir John and Mrs. Jennings express their indignation towards Willoughby's actions?&#10;Sir John and Mrs. Jennings expressed their disapproval of Willoughby's behavior because they were offended by his actions, particularly as he had left Marianne in such a distressed state without providing any explanation or relieving her situation. As friends of the Dashwood family, Sir John and Mrs. Jennings felt responsible for helping to console Marianne and protect Elinor from further harm. Their indignation towards Willoughby was a reflection of their loyalty to the sisters and their desire to see justice done." />
    <node id="1. The role of Lucy's reprimand in this interaction between Elinor and Lucy's brother is to check Elinor's impertinence, as she begins to find it too much for her temper. Lucy's sharp reprimand helps control Elinor's response towards her brother, preventing any further escalation of tension or conflict in their conversation. This allows Elinor to maintain her composure and civility while declining Miss Steele's proposal to visit Marianne.&#10;&#10;The supporting material provided also highlights that Lucy's reprimand serves to govern Elinor's manners, keeping the situation from escalating further and ensuring that Elinor maintains her composure. This allows for a more civil and respectful interaction between all parties involved." />
    <node id="1. The cause of Marianne's immediate and desperate reaction on the morning after a rupture with someone, as observed by Elinor in their shared living space, can be inferred from the supporting materials provided. While the narrative does not explicitly state the reason for her emotional state, it is likely due to her struggle in processing strong emotions, as indicated by her eagerness to leave and fixation on watching Elinor write the letter to their mother about what had happened. These actions suggest that Marianne is experiencing distress and unable to fully express or understand her feelings, leading to her intense reaction." />
    <node id="The narrative mentions that Mrs. Jennings brings a glass of Constantia wine for Marianne, believing it to be &quot;some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted.&quot; The wine was previously enjoyed by Mrs. Jennings' late husband when he experienced discomfort from his &quot;colicky gout.&quot; However, based on the information provided, it is not explicitly clear why Mrs. Jennings brings the wine to Elinor instead of giving it directly to Marianne. It can be inferred that she either wants Elinor's assistance in administering the wine or simply wishes to inform Elinor of its presence." />

Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,&#10;however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her&#10;aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet&#10;rest before she left her.&#10;&#10;In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by&#10;Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear,&quot; said she, entering, &quot;I have just recollected that I have&#10;some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was&#10;tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poor&#10;husband! how fond he was of it!  Whenever he had a touch of his old&#10;colicky gout" />

This information suggests that Colonel Brandon is eager to share with Elinor an encounter or some details about Mr. Willoughby that occurred after the latter's departure from Barton, which could potentially change Marianne's opinion of him. The gravity in Colonel Brandon's manner implies that this information might not be positive and may further confirm the unworthiness of Mr. Willoughby as a suitable partner for Marianne." />

What had caused Edward's feelings for Lucy to change: The narrative does not provide explicit information on what caused Edward's feelings for Lucy to change. However, it can be inferred that as he spent more time with the Dashwood sisters and got to know Elinor better, his initial infatuation with Lucy might have faded, allowing him to see her true character and intentions.&#10;2. Why does Marianne believe that some form of trickery must have been involved: Marianne finds it hard to accept that Willoughby could intentionally hurt her sister without any justification. Therefore, she assumes that someone must have instigated him against Elinor, possibly Lucy or other people in their social circle. This belief reflects Marianne's romantic view of the world, where she struggles to accept that people can act maliciously without any apparent reason.">

Additionally, he might have been reflecting on his own feelings towards Marianne, which could have contributed to his continued serious demeanor. Moreover, Colonel Brandon might not have wanted to appear overly cheerful or intrusive in light of Marianne's distress.&#10;   &#10;2. Marianne continues to feel miserable the next morning because she is struggling to come to terms with Willoughby's betrayal and the loss of her idealized image of him. The revelation of his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, as well as his intention to marry another woman, has deeply affected her, causing her to question not only their relationship but also herself. Furthermore, she is unable to speak about her feelings with Elinor, which contributes to her &quot;gloomy dejection.&quot;">

However, he was shocked when he heard about her divorce two years later and feared that she might have fallen victim to some dishonorable designs from her husband.&#10;&#10;The speaker then tells Elinor that he believes that Mrs. Brandon, upon hearing the wretched situation of Eliza and comparing it with her own, will realize how fortunate she is and feel less regret over her own situation. The speaker requests that Elinor use her discretion in communicating this to Mrs. Brandon, as it might be of service in lessening her regrets.&#10;&#10;It was revealed later in the narrative that Eliza had promised the speaker that nothing would prevent their elopement together to Scotland, but his cousin's maid betrayed them. The speaker was banished to a distant relative's house, and Eliza was not allowed any liberty, society, or amusement until her father's point was gained. The speaker had depended on Eliza's fortitude too far, and the blow of their thwarted elopement and subsequent marriage of Eliza to his brother was severe. However, if her marriage had been happy, a few months might have reconciled him to it.">

They had spent time together at Allenham House, which suggested a plan for their future life together. However, Mr. Willoughby later decided to marry another woman, Miss Grey, leaving Marianne in despair.&#10;&#10;Marianne finds it difficult to accept that Willoughby intentionally hurt her and believes that someone must have instigated him against her, possibly Lucy or other people in their social circle. This reflects Marianne's romantic view of the world, as she struggles to accept that people can act maliciously without any apparent reason.&#10;&#10;However, Elinor, who has a more practical perspective, believes that Willoughby never truly cared for Marianne and is surprised by her sister's reluctance to acknowledge this fact.

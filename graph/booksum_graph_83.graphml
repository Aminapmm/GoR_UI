    <node id="The objects presented by the Trojan prince to Latinus are a golden charger, a royal robe and tiara, and a golden scepter. These objects are symbolic of the Trojans' royal lineage and their connection to the ancient city of Troy. By presenting these items to Latinus, the Trojan prince is attempting to establish a sense of respect and trust between the two groups. He is also subtly implying that the Trojans have a legitimate claim to the land, as their ancestors once lived there.&#10;&#10;Latinus reacts to these objects with a mix of internal thoughts and emotions. On one hand, he is clearly impressed by the quality and significance of the items. The text states that he &quot;seem'd, and anxious in his breast; Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest, But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight; Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.&quot; This suggests that Latinus is deeply contemplating the implications of these objects, particularly in relation to his own position as ruler and the future of his kingdom.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Latinus is also aware of the prophecy that a foreign son will marry his daughter and rule over the land. The text states that &quot;when now the Trojan navy was in view&quot; (meaning that the Trojans had arrived on the shores of Latium), Latinus received a divine message indicating that the prophecy would soon be fulfilled. This further complicates Latinus' reaction to the presented objects, as he must weigh their symbolic significance against the larger forces at play.&#10;&#10;Overall, the presented objects are significant in establishing the Trojans' royal lineage and connection to the land, while also serving as a catalyst for Latinus' contemplation of his kingdom's future." />

    <node id="The initial peaceful scene is described as the sacred lake of Trivia, Veline fountains, and Nar, which are usually tranquil bodies of water. However, they start to shake due to the baleful blast, indicating that a dark storm is approaching. This transformation is a metaphor for the peace being disrupted and giving way to war. The fear among young mothers further highlights the sudden change in the atmosphere. The clowns and troops, who were ungoverned and boisterous, now prepare for battle with fresh recruits and embattled men, making the fields bright with flaming swords and brazen shields. This shining harvest displayed by both hosts symbolizes the readiness of both armies to fight, reflecting the escalating tension as they engage in war.

    <node id="1. Introduction: Hippolytus is a figure from Greek mythology, famed as the son of Theseus, the king of Athens, and Hippolyta, the queen of the Amazons. According to the supporting materials, he was born and raised in the Egerian groves near Aricia, where Diana's peaceful altars flame. He was also known by the name Virbius.&#10;&#10;2. Attempted Assault and Imprisonment: The text mentions that Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, who sought to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. As a result, Theseus imprisoned and ultimately sentenced Hippolytus to death.&#10;&#10;3. Death: Hippolytus was killed by wild horses on the sandy shore, bearing the guilt of his stepmother's false accusations. Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life.&#10;&#10;4. Resurrection and Name Change: Jupiter, angered by Diana's actions in bringing Hippolytus back to life, struck him down with a flaming dart. However, Diana once again intervened and kept Hippolytus hidden in secret shades, renaming him Virbius to protect him from Jupiter's wrath.&#10;&#10;5. Later Life: The text reveals that the second Virbius, Hippolytus' son, continued his father's legacy as a warrior and charioteer. This younger Virbius retained his father's art and trained horses for war.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hippolytus (also known as Virbius) was a figure from Greek mythology, famed as the son of Theseus and Hippolyta. He was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, falsely accused of attempting to rape her, and ultimately killed by wild horses. Diana intervened twice to restore his life and protect him from Jupiter's wrath, renaming him Virbius. The second Virbius continued his father's legacy as a warrior and charioteer." />

    <node id="The speaker's wife is concerned about her husband's decision to support Aeneas because she believes it goes against his prior commitments and loyalties. Specifically, she reminds him that he had previously promised to give his daughter Lavinia in marriage to Turnus, a friend and relative. By supporting Aeneas instead, her husband would be breaking this promise and wronging Turnus. Furthermore, she argues that by favoring a foreigner over his own people, her husband would open himself up to accusations of disloyalty and unfairness. She therefore urges him to reconsider his decision and uphold his original commitment to Turnus. This is inferred from the provided narrative excerpt, where the wife is portrayed as pleading with her husband not to give in to the &quot;cruel doom&quot; of supporting Aeneas, but rather to remember his duty to Turnus and the potential consequences of favoring foreigners." />

    <node id="1. Picus is a figure from Latin mythology, known as the son of Saturn and the father of Faunus. He was the king of the Sabines and was renowned for his beauty, which attracted the goddess Circe. However, Picus refused her love and remained faithful to his wife, Canens. As a result, Circe transformed him into a woodpecker out of spite.&#10;2. Picus was placed as the chief of the band of heroes depicted in the text due to his high status in Latin genealogy and mythology. He was considered the first king of Latium and was revered for his wisdom and justice. Although he met a tragic end by being transformed into a woodpecker, his legacy as a just ruler and a symbol of fidelity made him an appropriate choice to lead the band of heroes in the text.&#10;3. Additionally, Picus' association with Saturn, who was considered the founder of the Latin civilization, added to his significance in the mythology. By placing Picus at the helm of the heroic band, the author emphasized the importance of Latium's ancient heritage and its connection to the gods, which played a significant role in shaping the culture and identity of the Latin people." />

    <node id="The queen's distressing behavior in response to her inability to dissuade her son from seeking a foreign bride is expressed through her pleading with her husband and reminding him of his prior commitments and loyalties. She is worried that by supporting Aeneas, the Trojan prince, her husband would be breaking his promise to give their daughter Lavinia in marriage to Turnus, a friend and relative. She argues that this decision would open her husband up to accusations of disloyalty and unfairness, as he would be favoring a foreigner over his own people. The queen is so concerned about this issue that she urges her husband to reconsider his decision and uphold his original commitment to Turnus. This is evident in the narrative excerpt where the queen is portrayed as pleading with her husband not to give in to the &quot;cruel doom&quot; of supporting Aeneas, but rather to remember his duty to Turnus and the potential consequences of favoring foreigners." />

This is suggested when Latinus says, &quot;Say what you seek, and whither were you bound: Were you by stress of weather cast aground?&quot; The text then clarifies that this was not the case.&#10;2. Instead, it can be inferred that the Trojans deliberately sailed to the coast of Latium with a specific purpose. They intended to establish diplomatic relations with Latinus by presenting him gifts that symbolize their royal lineage and connection to the ancient city of Troy.&#10;3. The Trojan prince's actions are meant to create respect, trust, and a subtle claim to the land based on their ancestors' history in the region. Therefore, the primary reason for the Trojan train's presence in Latinus' kingdom is to seek an alliance, not to take refuge from stormy weather or repair their ships." />

The items presented by the Trojan prince to Latinus - a golden charger, a royal robe and tiara, and a golden scepter - are symbolic of the Trojans' royal lineage and their connection to the ancient city of Troy.

As Latinus gazes at the ground while holding the scepter, he is contemplating several important matters related to his kingdom's future. He is deeply contemplating the implications of these items, particularly in relation to his own position as ruler and the future of his kingdom.

The goddess Diana (also known as Trivia) ascends to a roof and blows her crooked horn, causing rocks, woods, and mountains to tremble at the infernal sound. This gathering has significant implications for the natural world, with tremors occurring in the sacred lake of Trivia, Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar, highlighting the power and impact of this assembly." />
    <node id="The Stygian Fury, Allecto, flies to a specific infernal lake in Italy, which is Avernus. This lake was believed by the Romans to be an entrance to the underworld. By having Allecto come from this lake, it emphasizes her supernatural and fearsome nature as well as highlights the seriousness of her actions in inciting conflict and war.&#10;&#10;The Fury's flight to Avernus is also related to Juno's attention to the progression of the war. Juno has commanded Allecto to stir up trouble between the Trojans and the Latins, and Allecto's arrival from Avernus underscores the dangerous and otherworldly consequences of Juno's interference. By involving Allecto, Juno is escalating the situation and ensuring that there will be no turning back from war.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Allecto comes from a lake that was believed to lead to the underworld suggests that Juno is willing to go to great lengths to achieve her goals. She is not afraid of bringing about chaos and destruction, and she is prepared to use any means necessary to ensure that her wishes are fulfilled. This highlights the depths of Juno's determination and the seriousness of the situation for both the Trojans and the Latins." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the Trojans continue to prosper despite Juno's enmity and efforts to destroy them mainly due to factors beyond Juno's control. First, when Juno first notices the Trojans' arrival in Latium, she observes that they have already managed to reach the shore safely, &quot;descend upon the shore, desert the main, / Design a town, and, with unhop'd success, / Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace&quot; (Virgil, Aeneid, Book VII). This early escape from destruction suggests that the Trojans have already been granted some degree of protection or good fortune.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Turnus himself acknowledges Juno's attention to his fate but dismisses her fears of war as delusional inventions in her lonely state. He believes that men should decide their own fates regarding peace and war rather than being controlled by the whims of a goddess. This implies that there are forces beyond Juno's control at play, such as human agency and decision-making.&#10;&#10;Moreover, although Juno attempts to incite conflict between the Latins and the Trojans by causing a storm at sea, this plan ultimately backfires and results in the death of Almon and Galesus, two well-regarded individuals. This development serves to heighten tensions and bring Juno closer to achieving her desired alliance through conflict, but it does not directly harm the Trojans themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Juno certainly tries her best to destroy the Trojans, her efforts are ultimately thwarted by factors beyond her control, such as human agency and good fortune. The narrative suggests that despite Juno's enmity, the Trojans continue to prosper due to a combination of their own resilience and external circumstances that work in their favor." />

Additionally, Picus' association with Saturn, who was considered the founder of the Latin civilization, added to his significance in the mythology. By placing Picus at the helm of the heroic band, the author emphasized the importance of Latium's ancient heritage and its connection to the gods, which played a significant role in shaping the culture and identity of the Latin people.">

According to the supporting materials, he was born and raised in the Egerian groves near Aricia, where Diana's peaceful altars flame. He was also known by the name Virbius.&#10;&#10;2. Attempted Assault and Imprisonment: The text mentions that Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, who sought to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. As a result, Theseus imprisoned and ultimately sentenced Hippolytus to death.&#10;&#10;3. Death: Hippolytus was killed by wild horses on the sandy shore, bearing the guilt of his stepmother's false accusations. Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life.&#10;&#10;4. Resurrection and Name Change: Jupiter, angered by Diana's actions in bringing Hippolytus back to life, struck him down with a flaming dart. However, Diana once again intervened and kept Hippolytus hidden in secret shades, renaming him Virbius to protect him from Jupiter's wrath.&#10;&#10;5. Later Life: The text reveals that the second Virbius, Hippolytus' son, continued his father's legacy as a warrior and charioteer. This younger Virbius retained his father's art and trained horses for war.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hippolytus (also known as Virbius) was a figure from Greek mythology, famed as the son of Theseus and Hippolyta. He was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, falsely accused of attempting to rape her, and ultimately killed by wild horses. Diana intervened twice to restore his life and protect him from Jupiter's wrath, renaming him Virbius. The second Virbius continued his father's legacy as a warrior and charioteer.">

Picus is a figure from Latin mythology, known as the son of Saturn and the father of Faunus. He was the king of the Sabines and was renowned for his beauty, which attracted the goddess Circe. However, Picus refused her love and remained faithful to his wife, Canens. As a result, Circe transformed him into a woodpecker out of spite.&#10;2. Picus was placed as the chief of the band of heroes depicted in the text due to his high status in Latin genealogy and mythology. He was considered the first king of Latium and was revered for his wisdom and justice. Although he met a tragic end by being transformed into a woodpecker, his legacy as a just ruler and a symbol of fidelity made him an appropriate choice to lead the band of heroes in the text.&#10;3. Additionally, Picus' association with Saturn, who was considered the founder of the Latin civilization, added to his significance in the mythology. By placing Picus at the helm of the heroic band, the author emphasized the importance of Latium's ancient heritage and its connection to the gods, which played a significant role in shaping the culture and identity of the Latin people.">

Specifically, she takes the form of a bird and flies to the Latian palace where she besieges the door of the queen's apartment. She then appears before Amata, who is distressed about her husband's decision to support Aeneas instead of Turnus, and urges Amata to incite war against the Trojans. Allecto also causes a hunting dog to go on a rampage, leading to confusion and fear among the people. These actions contribute to the growing tensions and hostilities between the Latins and the Trojans, setting the stage for conflict and war.">

This is suggested when Latinus says, &quot;Say what you seek, and whither were you bound: Were you by stress of weather cast aground?&quot; The text then clarifies that this was not the case.&#10;2. Instead, it can be inferred that the Trojans deliberately sailed to the coast of Latium with a specific purpose. They intended to establish diplomatic relations with Latinus by presenting him gifts that symbolize their royal lineage and connection to the ancient city of Troy.&#10;3. The Trojan prince's actions are meant to create respect, trust, and a subtle claim to the land based on their ancestors' history in the region. Therefore, the primary reason for the Trojan train's presence in Latinus' kingdom is to seek an alliance, not to take refuge from stormy weather or repair their ships.">

Attempted Assault and Imprisonment: The text mentions that Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, who sought to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. As a result, Theseus imprisoned and ultimately sentenced Hippolytus to death.&#10;&#10;3.

By having Allecto come from this lake, it emphasizes her supernatural and fearsome nature as well as highlights the seriousness of her actions in inciting conflict and war.&#10;&#10;The Fury's flight to Avernus is also related to Juno's attention to the progression of the war. Juno has commanded Allecto to stir up trouble between the Trojans and the Latins, and Allecto's arrival from Avernus underscores the dangerous and otherworldly consequences of Juno's interference. By involving Allecto, Juno is escalating the situation and ensuring that there will be no turning back from war.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Allecto comes from a lake that was believed to lead to the underworld suggests that Juno is willing to go to great lengths to achieve her goals. She is not afraid of bringing about chaos and destruction, and she is prepared to use any means necessary to ensure that her wishes are fulfilled.

First, when Juno first notices the Trojans' arrival in Latium, she observes that they have already managed to reach the shore safely, &quot;descend upon the shore, desert the main, / Design a town, and, with unhop'd success, / Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace&quot; (Virgil, Aeneid, Book VII). This early escape from destruction suggests that the Trojans have already been granted some degree of protection or good fortune.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Turnus himself acknowledges Juno's attention to his fate but dismisses her fears of war as delusional inventions in her lonely state. He believes that men should decide their own fates regarding peace and war rather than being controlled by the whims of a goddess. This implies that there are forces beyond Juno's control at play, such as human agency and decision-making.&#10;&#10;Moreover, although Juno attempts to incite conflict between the Latins and the Trojans by causing a storm at sea, this plan ultimately backfires and results in the death of Almon and Galesus, two well-regarded individuals. This development serves to heighten tensions and bring Juno closer to achieving her desired alliance through conflict, but it does not directly harm the Trojans themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Juno certainly tries her best to destroy the Trojans, her efforts are ultimately thwarted by factors beyond her control, such as human agency and good fortune. The narrative suggests that despite Juno's enmity, the Trojans continue to prosper due to a combination of their own resilience and external circumstances that work in their favor.">

Furthermore, she argues that by favoring a foreigner over his own people, her husband would open himself up to accusations of disloyalty and unfairness. She therefore urges him to reconsider his decision and uphold his original commitment to Turnus. This is inferred from the provided narrative excerpt, where the wife is portrayed as pleading with her husband not to give in to the &quot;cruel doom&quot; of supporting Aeneas, but rather to remember his duty to Turnus and the potential consequences of favoring foreigners.">

Introduction: Hippolytus is a figure from Greek mythology, famed as the son of Theseus, the king of Athens, and Hippolyta, the queen of the Amazons. According to the supporting materials, he was born and raised in the Egerian groves near Aricia, where Diana's peaceful altars flame. He was also known by the name Virbius.&#10;&#10;2. Attempted Assault and Imprisonment: The text mentions that Hippolytus was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, who sought to seduce him. When he rejected her advances, she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her. As a result, Theseus imprisoned and ultimately sentenced Hippolytus to death.&#10;&#10;3. Death: Hippolytus was killed by wild horses on the sandy shore, bearing the guilt of his stepmother's false accusations. Diana, who held affection for Hippolytus, deplored his death and used Aesculapian herbs to restore his life.&#10;&#10;4. Resurrection and Name Change: Jupiter, angered by Diana's actions in bringing Hippolytus back to life, struck him down with a flaming dart. However, Diana once again intervened and kept Hippolytus hidden in secret shades, renaming him Virbius to protect him from Jupiter's wrath.&#10;&#10;5. Later Life: The text reveals that the second Virbius, Hippolytus' son, continued his father's legacy as a warrior and charioteer. This younger Virbius retained his father's art and trained horses for war.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hippolytus (also known as Virbius) was a figure from Greek mythology, famed as the son of Theseus and Hippolyta. He was pursued by his stepmother Phaedra, falsely accused of attempting to rape her, and ultimately killed by wild horses. Diana intervened twice to restore his life and protect him from Jupiter's wrath, renaming him Virbius. The second Virbius continued his father's legacy as a warrior and charioteer.">

Specifically, she reminds him that he had previously promised to give his daughter Lavinia in marriage to Turnus, a friend and relative. By supporting Aeneas instead, her husband would be breaking this promise and wronging Turnus. Furthermore, she argues that by favoring a foreigner over his own people, her husband would open himself up to accusations of disloyalty and unfairness. She therefore urges him to reconsider his decision and uphold his original commitment to Turnus. This is inferred from the provided narrative excerpt, where the wife is portrayed as pleading with her husband not to give in to the &quot;cruel doom&quot; of supporting Aeneas, but rather to remember his duty to Turnus and the potential consequences of favoring foreigners.">

Picus is a figure from Latin mythology, known as the son of Saturn and the father of Faunus. He was the king of the Sabines and was renowned for his beauty, which attracted the goddess Circe. However, Picus refused her love and remained faithful to his wife, Canens. As a result, Circe transformed him into a woodpecker out of spite.&#10;2. Picus was placed as the chief of the band of heroes depicted in the text due to his high status in Latin genealogy and mythology. He was considered the first king of Latium and was revered for his wisdom and justice. Although he met a tragic end by being transformed into a woodpecker, his legacy as a just ruler and a symbol of fidelity made him an appropriate choice to lead the band of heroes in the text.&#10;3. Additionally, Picus' association with Saturn, who was considered the founder of the Latin civilization, added to his significance in the mythology. By placing Picus at the helm of the heroic band, the author emphasized the importance of Latium's ancient heritage and its connection to the gods, which played a significant role in shaping the culture and identity of the Latin people.">

This early escape from destruction suggests that the Trojans have already been granted some degree of protection or good fortune.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Turnus himself acknowledges Juno's attention to his fate but dismisses her fears of war as delusional inventions in her lonely state. He believes that men should decide their own fates regarding peace and war rather than being controlled by the whims of a goddess. This implies that there are forces beyond Juno's control at play, such as human agency and decision-making.&#10;&#10;Moreover, although Juno attempts to incite conflict between the Latins and the Trojans by causing a storm at sea, this plan ultimately backfires and results in the death of Almon and Galesus, two well-regarded individuals. This development serves to heighten tensions and bring Juno closer to achieving her desired alliance through conflict, but it does not directly harm the Trojans themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Juno certainly tries her best to destroy the Trojans, her efforts are ultimately thwarted by factors beyond her control, such as human agency and good fortune. The narrative suggests that despite Juno's enmity, the Trojans continue to prosper due to a combination of their own resilience and external circumstances that work in their favor.">

He believes that Juno has been paying special attention to his fate, but he also implies that she has become delusional in her lonely state by imagining weapons and conflicts in her temple. Turnus tells his mother to focus on the temple and allow men to decide their own fate regarding peace and war.">

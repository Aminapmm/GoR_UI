    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon is asking Alice to help locate a missing important document, which Matthew Maule claims to be able to discover through her means. The document in question is significant as it went missing long before Alice's birth and its recovery could have potential importance for the Pyncheon family. Mr. Pyncheon requests his daughter to answer Matthew Maule's inquiries, comply with reasonable requests, and engage in a lawful investigation to find the document." />
    <node id=", Alice,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and confusion.&#10;    &quot;This young man--his name is Matthew Maule--professes, so far as I can&#10;    understand him, to be able to discover, through your means, a certain&#10;    paper or parchment, which was missing long before your birth.  The&#10;    importance of the document in question renders it advisable to neglect&#10;    no possible, even if improbable, method of regaining it.  You will&#10;    therefore oblige me, my dear Alice, by answering this person's&#10;    inquiries, and complying with his lawful and reasonable requests, so&#10;    far as they may appear to have the aforesaid object in view.  As I&#10;    shall remain in the room, you need apprehend no rude nor unbecoming&#10;    deportment, on the young man's part; and, at your slightest wish, of&#10;    course, the investigation, or whatever we may call it, shall&#10;    immediately be broken off.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Mistress Alice Pyncheon,&quot; remarked Matthew Maule, with the utmost&#10; " />
    <node id="   that made Maule so subtile in his preception.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Does the girl look at me as if I were a brute beast?&quot; thought he,&#10;    setting his teeth.  &quot;She shall know whether I have a human spirit; and&#10;    the worse for her, if it prove stronger than her own!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;My father, you sent for me,&quot; said Alice, in her sweet and harp-like&#10;    voice.  &quot;But, if you have business with this young man, pray let me go&#10;    again.  You know I do not love this room, in spite of that Claude, with&#10;    which you try to bring back sunny recollections.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Stay a moment, young lady, if you please!&quot; said Matthew Maule.  &quot;My&#10;    business with your father is over.  With yourself, it is now to begin!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Alice looked towards her father, in surprise and inquiry.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Yes, Alice,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and confusion.&#10;    &quot;This young man--his name is Matthew Maule--" />

He waved her back, and, retreating, Alice sank again into her&#10;    seat.&#10;&#10;    &quot;She is mine!&quot; said Matthew Maule.  &quot;Mine, by the right of the&#10;    strongest spirit!&quot;&#10;&#10;    In the further progress of the legend, there is a long, grotesque, and&#10;    occasionally awe-striking account of the carpenter's incantations (if&#10;            so they are to be called), with a view of discovering the lost&#10;    document.  It appears to have been his object to convert the mind of&#10;    Alice into a kind of telescopic medium, through which Mr. Pyncheon and&#10;    himself might obtain a glimpse into the spiritual world.  He succeeded,&#10;    accordingly, in holding an imperfect sort of intercourse, at one&#10;    remove, with the departed personages in whose custody the so much&#10;    valued secret had been carried beyond the precincts of earth.  During&#10;    her" />

It was an ordinary saying that the old wizard, hanged&#10;    though he was, had obtained the best end of the bargain in his contest&#10;    with Colonel Pyncheon; inasmuch as he had got possession of the" />
    <node id=" Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at&#10;    last, there was anger mixed up with his pride.  &quot;What can my daughter&#10;    have to do with a business like this?&quot;&#10;&#10;    Indeed, at this new demand on the carpenter's part, the proprietor of&#10;    the Seven Gables was even more thunder-struck than at the cool&#10;    proposition to surrender his house.  There was, at least, an assignable&#10;    motive for the first stipulation; there appeared to be none whatever&#10;    for the last.  Nevertheless, Matthew Maule sturdily insisted on the&#10;    young lady being summoned, and even gave her father to understand, in a&#10;    mysterious kind of explanation,--which made the matter considerably&#10;    darker than it looked before,--that the only chance of acquiring the&#10;    requisite knowledge was through the clear, crystal medium of a pure and&#10;    virgin intelligence, like that of the fair Alice.

It was then his&#10;    daughter's will, in opposition to his own, that the experiment should&#10;    be fully tried.  Henceforth, therefore, he did but consent, not urge&#10;    it.  And was it not for her sake far more than for his own that he&#10;    desired its success? That lost parchment once restored, the beautiful&#10;    Alice Pyncheon, with the rich dowry which he could then bestow, might&#10;    wed an English duke or a German reigning-prince, instead of some New&#10;    England clergyman or lawyer! At the thought, the ambitious father&#10;    almost consented, in his heart, that, if the devil's power were needed&#10;    to the accomplishment of this great object, Maule might evoke him.&#10;    Alice's own purity would be her safeguard.&#10;&#10;    With his mind full of" />
    <node id="The search of the wizard's grave near Gallows Hill did not yield much. The only notable discovery was that the right hand of the skeleton was missing. This detail is significant because it connects to the popular belief that the Maules had a mysterious connection to the vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons. According to rumors, the old wizard, despite being hanged, had obtained the best end of his contest with Colonel Pyncheon by possessing the great Eastern claim. The lawyers were interested in finding something in that particular grave because they traced some of these popular beliefs to chance words and obscure hints of the executed wizard's son, who was the father of the present Matthew Maule. They hoped to find evidence supporting these rumors or shedding light on the Pyncheon family's past." />

A very&#10;    aged woman, recently dead, had often used the metaphorical expression,&#10;    in her fireside talk, that miles and miles of the Pyncheon lands had&#10;    been shovelled into Maule's grave; which, by the bye, was but a very&#10;    shallow nook, between two rocks, near the summit of Gallows Hill.&#10;    Again, when the lawyers were making inquiry for the missing document,&#10;    it was a by-word that it would never be found, unless in the wizard's&#10;    skeleton hand.  So much weight had the shrewd lawyers assigned to these&#10;    fables, that (but Mr. Pyncheon did not see fit to inform the carpenter&#10;            of the fact) they had secretly caused the wizard's grave to be&#10;    searched.

Nothing was discovered, however, except that, unaccountably,&#10;    the right hand of the skeleton was gone.&#10;&#10;    Now, what was unquestionably important, a portion of these popular&#10;    rumors could be traced, though rather doubtfully and indistinctly, to&#10;    chance words and obscure hints of the executed wizard's son, and the&#10;    father of this present Matthew Maule.  And here Mr. Pyncheon could&#10;    bring an item of his own personal evidence into play.  Though but a&#10;    child at the time, he either remembered or fancied that Matthew's&#10;    father had had some job to perform on the day before, or possibly the&#10;    very morning of the Colonel's decease, in the private room where he and&#10;    the carpenter were at this moment talking.  Certain papers belonging to&#10;    Colonel Pyncheon, as his grandson distinctly recollected, had been&#10;    spread out on the table.&#10;&#10;    Matthew Mau" />

But, in truth, the picture was no more to him at&#10;    that moment than the blank wall against which it hung.  His mind was&#10;    haunted with the many and strange tales which he had heard, attributing&#10;    mysterious if not supernatural endowments to these Maules, as well the&#10;    grandson here present as his two immediate ancestors.  Mr. Pyncheon's&#10;    long residence abroad, and intercourse with men of wit and&#10;    fashion,--courtiers, worldings, and free-thinkers,--had done much&#10;    towards obliterating the grim Puritan superstitions, which no man of&#10;    New England birth at that early period could entirely escape.

Might not&#10;    this influence be the same that was called witchcraft?&#10;&#10;    Turning half around, he caught a glimpse of Maule's figure in the&#10;    looking-glass.  At some paces from Alice, with his arms uplifted in the&#10;    air, the carpenter made a gesture as if directing downward a slow,&#10;    ponderous, and invisible weight upon the maiden.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Stay, Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, stepping forward.  &quot;I forbid&#10;    your proceeding further!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Pray, my dear father, do not interrupt the young man,&quot; said Alice,&#10;    without changing her position.  &quot;His efforts, I assure you, will prove&#10;  " />

It was a wild&#10;   story, perhaps, but seemed not altogether so incredible to those who&#10;   could remember what an inflexibly obstinate old fellow this wizard&#10;   Maule had been.&#10;&#10;   Now, the wizard's grandson, the young Matthew Maule of our story, was&#10;   popularly supposed to have inherited some of his ancestor's&#10;   questionable traits.  It is wonderful how many absurdities were&#10;   promulgated in reference to the young man.  He was fabled, for example,&#10;   to have a strange power of getting into people's dreams, and regulating&#10;   matters there according to his own fancy, pretty much like the&#10;   stage-manager of a theatre.

    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon finds it difficult to accept the carpenter's seemingly reasonable terms because of the sentimental and symbolic value of the House of the Seven Gables, which has been in his family for generations. The house represents his ancestry and family history, and he feels that giving up the house would not be in line with his dead grandfather's wishes. Additionally, Mr. Pyncheon may have an emotional attachment to the house, as it was his childhood home, and he may have pleasant associations connected with it despite the &quot;ghastly&quot; presence of his grandfather's spirit.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Pyncheon is focused on settling the Eastern claim and securing his family's financial future by acquiring vast tracts of land in Maine. He sees the House of the Seven Gables as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. Therefore, he initially finds it difficult to accept the carpenter's terms, which require him to give up the house without any clear benefit to his financial situation or his family's legacy.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Pyncheon eventually considers Maule's conditions and enters into negotiations with him, indicating that his initial reluctance may have been due to a mixture of sentimentality, a sense of obligation to his dead grandfather, and a lack of clear incentive to give up the house." />

The Eastern claim once&#10;    fairly settled, and put upon the firm basis of actual possession, Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon's property--to be measured by miles, not acres--would be worth&#10;    an earldom, and would reasonably entitle him to solicit, or enable him&#10;    to purchase, that elevated dignity from the British monarch.  Lord&#10;    Pyncheon!--or the Earl of Waldo!--how could such a magnate be expected&#10;    to contract his grandeur within the pitiful compass of seven shingled&#10;    gables?&#10;&#10;    In short, on an enlarged view of the business, the carpenter's terms&#10;    appeared so ridiculously easy that Mr. Pyncheon could scarcely forbear&#10;    laughing in his face.  He was quite ashamed, after the foregoing&#10;    reflections, to propose any diminution of so moderate a recompense for&#10;    the immense service to be rendered.&#10;&#10;    &quot;I consent to your proposition" />
    <node id=" The carpenter, however, stepped at once to the hearth, and turned&#10;    himself about, so as to look Mr. Pyncheon in the face.&#10;&#10;    &quot;You sent for me,&quot; said he.  &quot;Be pleased to explain your business, that&#10;    I may go back to my own affairs.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Ah! excuse me,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon quietly.  &quot;I did not mean to tax&#10;    your time without a recompense.  Your name, I think, is Maule,--Thomas&#10;    or Matthew Maule,--a son or grandson of the builder of this house?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Matthew Maule,&quot; replied the carpenter,--&quot;son of him who built the&#10;    house,--grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I know the dispute to which you allude,&quot; observed Mr. Pyncheon with&#10;    undisturbed equanimity.  &quot;I am well aware that my grandfather was&#10;    compelled to resort to a suit at law, in order to establish his claim&#10;    to the foundation-site of this" />

Others say that Matthew Maule was contented&#10;    with a private written agreement, in which Mr. Pyncheon pledged his&#10;    honor and integrity to the fulfillment of the terms concluded upon.&#10;    The gentleman then ordered wine, which he and the carpenter drank&#10;    together, in confirmation of their bargain.  During the whole preceding&#10;    discussion and subsequent formalities, the old Puritan's portrait seems&#10;    to have persisted in its shadowy gestures of disapproval; but without&#10;    effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he&#10;    thought" />

I have no other terms to propose.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Impossible as he at first thought it to comply with Maule's conditions,&#10;    still, on a second glance, Mr. Pyncheon was of opinion that they might&#10;    at least be made matter of discussion.  He himself had no personal&#10;    attachment for the house, nor any pleasant associations connected with&#10;    his childish residence in it.  On the contrary, after seven-and-thirty&#10;    years, the presence of his dead grandfather seemed still to pervade it,&#10;    as on that morning when the affrighted boy had beheld him, with so&#10;    ghastly an" />

For a long time Matthew Maule is said to have turned a&#10;    cold ear to these propositions. At last, however, with a strange kind&#10;    of laugh, he inquired whether Mr. Pyncheon would make over to him the&#10;    old wizard's homestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, now standing on it, in requital of the documentary evidence so&#10;    urgently required.&#10;&#10;    The wild, chimney-corner legend (which, without copying all its&#10;            extravagances, my narrative essentially follows) here gives an account&#10;    of some very strange behavior on the part of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    portrait.

The carpenter, Matthew Maule, is preventing Mr. Pyncheon from gaining custody of the secret because he believes that there is a &quot;mysterious connection and dependence&quot; between his family and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions.

Matthew thinks that he can exercise some subtle influence over the Pyncheon household through this connection, and he sees Alice as a way to tap into that influence. He insists that she is necessary for acquiring the requisite knowledge due to his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; to serve as a clear medium for discovering hidden truths or information.&#10;&#10;2. Mr. Pyncheon's blood relation to Maule plays a significant role in their confrontation because Matthew claims that he has subtle influence over the Pyncheon household through his grandfather's curse. The community also supports these claims, believing in a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. This belief adds weight to Matthew's demands and makes Mr. Pyncheon more cautious about opposing him directly.&#10;&#10;In summary, the carpenter, Matthew Maule, is preventing Mr. Pyncheon from gaining custody of the secret because he believes that he has a subtle influence over the Pyncheon household due to his family's alleged connection to the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. This belief stems from the popular legend that Maule's grandfather, who was accused of witchcraft, had cursed the Pyncheon family. Mr. Pyncheon's blood relation to Maule adds a layer of complexity to their confrontation, as Matthew's claims of subtle influence are taken more seriously due to their familial connection." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there is a thematic connection between the rumors about the stolen right hand of the wizard's skeleton and Matthew Maule's father's activities in Colonel Pyncheon's private room before his death. The connection lies in the popular belief that the Maules have some mysterious connection to the vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, including the missing papers. This belief stems from rumors suggesting that the wizard had obtained the best end of his contest with Colonel Pyncheon by possessing the great Eastern claim.&#10;&#10;The narrative mentions that Matthew Maule's father was believed to have performed some job in Colonel Pyncheon's private room on the day before or possibly the very morning of the Colonel's decease, when papers belonging to him were spread out on the table. Although it is not explicitly stated that Matthew Maule's father had anything to do with the missing papers belonging to Colonel Pyncheon, there is a suggestion in the narrative that he might have been involved or at least present when the documents were accessible.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no definitive proof of Matthew Maule's father being connected to the stolen right hand or the missing papers, there are thematic connections and rumors suggesting a possible involvement due to the belief in a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions." />

However, it was said that the wizard obtained the better end of the bargain since he haunted the land and the mansion after his death.&#10;&#10;The ghostly Matthew Maule threatens to interfere with the mansion's affairs if his demands for ground-rent or ownership are not met because he wants to exercise control over the Pyncheons, just like his grandfather did when he was alive. The neighbors and even Mr. Pyncheon acknowledge that there is a connection between the Maule family and the unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, which adds weight to Matthew Maule's haunting and claims.&#10;&#10;In summary, the ghost of Matthew Maule insists on haunting the House of the Seven Gables and demanding an unsettled claim for ground-rent because of his belief in rightful ownership passed down from his ancestor, as well as a desire to exert control over the Pyncheon family and influence their affairs." />

    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon allows Matthew Maule's experiment with the Claude mirror to continue, despite his initial reluctance, primarily due to two reasons:&#10;&#10;1. The potential significance of the missing document: Mr. Pyncheon is extremely motivated to find this important document for the Pyncheon family's interests. Its recovery could have substantial importance, and he sees it as a crucial step in securing a better future for his daughter Alice. He even considers overlooking social conventions and making deals with Maule to ensure the document's recovery.&#10;&#10;2. Alice's will and safeguarding her purity: When Alice shows no fear of Matthew Maule and insists on letting him continue with the experiment, Mr. Pyncheon consents not only for his sake but also for hers. He believes that if it takes invoking the devil's power to recover the document, then so be it; as long as Alice remains pure, she will be safe from any ill effects. By allowing the experiment to continue, he hopes to secure a better future for her, possibly even with an English duke or German reigning-prince instead of a local clergyman or lawyer.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Pyncheon's motivation for allowing Maule's experiment to continue is driven by his desire to recover the missing document and secure a better future for his daughter Alice while ensuring her safety and purity throughout the process." />
    <node id="Alice Pyncheon was compelled by Matthew Maule, an individual who believed in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; for discovering hidden truths, to attend his wedding to a laborer's daughter. Feeling humiliated and degraded, she was made to wait on his bride despite her own lost self-control and desire not to marry due to Maule's influence over her. This series of events led her to feel such a strong longing to change her nature, wishing to be as lowly as a worm. The inclement weather further added to her misery after she left the wedding. This situation highlights how Matthew Maule's manipulations and Alice's susceptibility due to her virginity drove her to feel extreme humiliation, ultimately desiring a complete change in nature." />

    <node id="Young Matthew Maule is a carpenter who is generally disliked in the town where he resides. The animosity towards him doesn't stem from any dishonorable actions on his part but rather from his character and deportment, as well as his lineage. Matthew is the grandson of an infamous wizard named Matthew Maule, one of the early settlers who was known to be a terrible wizard in his day. This older Maule was hanged during the time when witch-hunts were prevalent, and rumors circulated that he had secretly caused Colonel Pyncheon's death.&#10;&#10;After the elder Matthew's execution, his right hand was found missing from his grave. There were whispers that the son of the executed wizard, who is Matthew Maule's father, may have been involved in some way with the Colonel's demise. As a child, Mr. Pyncheon remembered or imagined that this father had been performing some job in the private room where Colonel Pyncheon kept his papers on the day before or possibly the morning of his death. This connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons has contributed to the townspeople's mistrust of Matthew Maule.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are many superstitions surrounding Matthew, such as having the ability to get into people's dreams and control their actions, and being able to cast spells through his eye, contributing to the animosity towards him despite no concrete evidence of wrongdoing on his part." />

    <node id="Alice Pyncheon, a character from Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; experiences a profound emotional and psychological bondage to Matthew Maule. This bondage is primarily due to two factors:&#10;&#10;1. Matthew Maule's belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; as a clear medium for discovering hidden truths or information: Matthew Maule targets Alice Pyncheon due to her virginity and perceived innocence, believing she can help him uncover hidden secrets related to the Pyncheon family.&#10;&#10;2. Matthew Maule's alleged subtle influence over the Pyncheon household, which stems from the community's belief that his grandfather, accused of witchcraft, had cursed the Pyncheon family: Matthew Maule capitalizes on this belief and manipulates Alice into feeling that she is &quot;fairly mine&quot; and will remember him.&#10;&#10;As a result of these factors, Matthew Maule is able to control Alice's emotions and actions by:&#10;&#10;- Compelling her to attend his wedding despite her reluctance and humiliation&#10;- Influencing her desire to change her nature and feel as lowly as a worm due to her susceptibility&#10;- Making Alice believe that she is necessary for acquiring the requisite knowledge&#10;- Causing Alice's father, Mr. Pyncheon, to overlook social conventions and make financial offers to Matthew Maule in pursuit of an important document&#10;&#10;These manipulations show how Matthew Maule exerts emotional and psychological control over Alice Pyncheon, creating a bondage that significantly impacts her life and relationships within the novel." />

Alice feels humiliated and degraded by this experience, as she is made to wait on Maule's bride despite her own lost self-control and desire not to marry. This situation highlights how Matthew Maule's manipulations and Alice's susceptibility due to her virginity drove her to feel extreme humiliation, ultimately desiring a complete change in nature.

    <node id="The question seems to be comparing an event from Lewis Carroll's &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; with a scenario from Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; but the provided text does not include any event related to the Mad Hatter from &quot;Through the Looking-Glass.&quot; Therefore, I'm assuming you want an answer based on the excerpt provided, which is about Matthew Maule humbling Alice Pyncheon in &quot;The House of the Seven Gables.&quot;&#10;&#10;Matthew Maule attempted to subtly influence and humble Alice Pyncheon by using a gesture that made her feel as if she was under some sort of evil power. Instead of being harmed physically, Alice faced psychological consequences from this encounter. She instinctively knew an evil force was trying to penetrate her sphere, so she decided to confront it with her own strength, which she believed was derived from her beauty, purity, and womanhood.&#10;&#10;However, by putting herself on terms of defiance against Maule's power, Alice inadvertently set off a chain of events that led to her demise. Matthew Maule was known for his supposed ability to enter people's dreams and manipulate them according to his own fancy. Because of Alice's confrontational attitude, he took advantage of this ability to bring about her downfall. He haunted Alice in her dreams until she became ill and eventually died, which caused great sorrow and mourning for the Pyncheon family." />

Setting aside all advantages of&#10;    rank, this fair girl deemed herself conscious of a power--combined of&#10;    beauty, high, unsullied purity, and the preservative force of&#10;    womanhood--that could make her sphere impenetrable, unless betrayed by&#10;    treachery within.  She instinctively knew, it may be, that some&#10;    sinister or evil potency was now striving to pass her barriers; nor&#10;    would she decline the contest.

    <node id="1. Colonel Pyncheon had confidently anticipated success in his Eastern claim, which indicates that he had some form of substantial evidence or documents to support this claim. However, such grounds were not apparent to his heirs. This suggests that the colonel might have kept the essential document secret or hidden it away from others' knowledge.&#10;&#10;2. The family traditions and legal advisers believe that Colonel Pyncheon was in possession of some deed or other document that was crucial for this claim but has since disappeared. The fact that the document is missing indicates that someone might have taken it or destroyed it deliberately, or it could be lost or misplaced accidentally.&#10;&#10;3. There are rumors and popular beliefs suggesting a mysterious connection between the Maule family and the vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, including the missing papers. Matthew Maule's father was present in Colonel Pyncheon's private room before his death when papers belonging to him were spread out on the table. It is possible that he might have had access to or knowledge about the whereabouts of the essential document related to the Eastern claim, especially considering the recent discovery of the missing right hand in the wizard's grave.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is no definitive evidence pointing to what happened to Colonel Pyncheon's essential document for his Eastern claim, rumors and thematic connections suggest a possible involvement of Matthew Maule's father due to the belief in a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. It is plausible that the missing right hand from the wizard's grave could have some relevance to this situation, hinting at a hidden truth waiting to be uncovered." />

    <node id="1. Circumstances of Alice's strange trance and waking: In Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; Matthew Maule puts Alice Pyncheon into a trance-like state using an upward gesture of his hands while claiming that she is &quot;fairly mine.&quot; After Maule leaves, Alice awakens from her trance without any recollection of the experience. She instantly assumes a cold but gentle demeanor when recognizing Matthew Maule.&#10;2. Inferred relationship between Alice Pyncheon and Matthew Maule: From their interaction, we can infer that there is a significant power imbalance in their relationship. Matthew Maule exerts emotional and psychological control over Alice, who is unable to resist his manipulations due to his alleged subtle influence on the Pyncheon household and his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot; This power dynamic eventually leads to Alice's downfall as she becomes ill and dies after Maule haunts her in her dreams due to her confrontational attitude towards him." />
    <node id="1. The power or force that caused Alice Pyncheon to become the &quot;slave&quot; of Matthew Maule is never explicitly stated in the narrative. However, it is heavily implied that Matthew Maule has some sort of subtle psychological control over her due to his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot; He manipulates her through this alleged influence, leading her into a trance-like state and compelling her to do his bidding.&#10;   &#10;2. The reason why this became a consequence of her father's desire to measure his land by miles instead of acres is because he had martyred his daughter to this inordinate desire. This likely means that he prioritized his obsession with land measurement over Alice's well-being, making her vulnerable to Matthew Maule's manipulations and ultimately leading to her downfall. The text suggests that the power controlling Alice was something she &quot;little dreamed of,&quot; indicating that it was related to her father's actions and obsessions rather than any conscious choice on her part." />
    <node id=" On recognizing Matthew Maule, she assumed an air of&#10;    somewhat cold but gentle dignity, the rather, as there was a certain&#10;    peculiar smile on the carpenter's visage that stirred the native pride&#10;    of the fair Alice.   So ended, for that time, the quest for the lost&#10;    title-deed of the Pyncheon territory at the Eastward; nor, though often&#10;    subsequently renewed, has it ever yet befallen a Pyncheon to set his&#10;    eye upon that parchment.&#10;&#10;    But, alas for the beautiful, the gentle, yet too haughty Alice!  A&#10;    power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden&#10;    soul.  A will, most unlike her own, constrained her to do its grotesque&#10;    and fantastic bidding.  Her father as it proved, had martyred his poor&#10;    child to an inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead&#10;    of acres.

Matthew Maule insists that the only way to acquire the necessary knowledge is through Alice, whose pure and virgin intelligence can serve as a clear medium. Mr. Pyncheon believes he has &quot;old Maule's blood to drink&quot; because he feels dominated by the carpenter, who seems to exercise an influence over his daughter. Mr. Pyncheon demands the return of his daughter because he fears for her safety and wants to protect her from any potential harm or manipulation." />

Despite his initial reluctance due to sentimental and symbolic value, lack of clear incentive, and a sense of obligation to his dead grandfather, Mr. Pyncheon eventually realized that he himself had no personal attachment to the house, nor any pleasant associations connected with his childish residence in it.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Mr. Pyncheon's plans for the house changed once he learned about its supposed connection to the Maule family and the alleged curse that came with it. He may have thought that keeping the house would somehow help settle the score or appease the curse. Ultimately, Mr. Pyncheon returned to the House of the Seven Gables because his financial situation and legacy were secured through the settlement of the Eastern claim, and he saw a new purpose for the house beyond just being a means to an end." />

Yet it was a call for&#10;    help!--his conscience never doubted it;--and, little more than a&#10;    whisper to his ear, it was a dismal shriek, and long reechoed so, in&#10;    the region round his heart! But this time the father did not turn.&#10;&#10;    After a further interval, Maule spoke.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Behold your daughter,&quot; said he.&#10;&#10;    Mr. Pyncheon came hastily forward.  The carpenter was standing erect in&#10;    front of Alice's chair, and pointing his finger towards the maiden with&#10;    an expression of triumphant power, the limits of which could not be&#10;    defined" />
    <node id="Yes, Mr. Pyncheon might consider discussing the carpenter's condition of giving up his house because, despite his initial disbelief and reluctance, he ultimately recognizes that he has no personal attachment to the house and is negatively affected by his dead grandfather's lingering presence there. The carpenter's proposal presents an opportunity for Mr. Pyncheon to free himself from this burden, even though it was initially difficult for him to accept due to sentimental reasons and a sense of obligation to his ancestry. Furthermore, the carpenter's connection to the house and the alleged curse on the Pyncheon family might give Mr. Pyncheon an additional incentive to negotiate and consider giving up the house as part of settling the score or appeasing the curse." />
    <node id=" of disapproval; but without&#10;    effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he&#10;    thought he beheld his grandfather frown.&#10;&#10;    &quot;This sherry is too potent a wine for me; it has affected my brain&#10;    already,&quot; he observed, after a somewhat startled look at the picture.&#10;    &quot;On returning to Europe, I shall confine myself to the more delicate&#10;    vintages of Italy and France, the best of which will not bear&#10;    transportation.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;My Lord Pyncheon may drink what wine he will, and wherever he&#10;    pleases,&quot; replied the carpenter, as if he had been privy to Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon's ambitious projects.  &quot;But first, sir, if you desire tidings&#10;    of this lost document, I must crave the favor of a little talk with&#10;    your fair daughter Alice.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;You are mad, Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at&#10;    last, there was anger mixed up with his pride." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Alice Pyncheon defies Matthew Maule's perceived strength and influence by asserting her independence and courage. This occurs after a series of manipulations and humiliations at Maule's hand, culminating in her attending his wedding to a laborer's daughter. Feeling degraded and desiring a complete change in nature, Alice experiences an extreme emotional response, leading to her confrontational attitude towards Maule.&#10;&#10;Alice's statement of fearlessness is a testament to her determination to resist Maule's control, even if it puts her at risk. She asserts her individuality and autonomy by remaining true to herself, refusing to submit to his manipulations despite his alleged subtle influence on the Pyncheon household and his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this context, Alice's defiance signifies her growing resistance to Maule's psychological control and her desire to reclaim her agency. Her courage is a crucial aspect of her character development, as it highlights her ability to confront and challenge oppressive power dynamics, even in the face of potential harm or backlash." />
    <node id="The carpenter, Matthew Maule, chose to defy social norms and approach the principal entrance of the Pyncheon house instead of using the back or side door as a form of protest against the Pyncheon family. This action signified his resentment for what he believed was unjust treatment towards his ancestors. Centuries prior, Maule's grandfather had owned the land where the Pyncheon House now stood before Colonel Pyncheon took it from him, which eventually led to the alleged curse on the Pyncheon family. By using the main entrance, Matthew Maule intended to make a statement about his connection to the house and his belief in its rightful ownership by his family lineage." />

But the&#10;   carpenter had a great deal of pride and stiffness in his nature; and,&#10;   at this moment, moreover, his heart was bitter with the sense of&#10;   hereditary wrong, because he considered the great Pyncheon House to be&#10;   standing on soil which should have been his own.  On this very site,&#10;   beside a spring of delicious water, his grandfather had felled the&#10;   pine-trees and built a cottage, in which children had been born to him;&#10;   and it was only from a dead man's stiffened fingers that Colonel&#10;   Pyncheon had wrested away the title-deeds.  So young Maule went&#10;   straight to the principal entrance, beneath a portal of carved oak, and&#10;   gave such a peal of the iron knocker that you would have imagined the&#10;   stern old wizard himself to be standing at the threshold.&#10;&#10; " />
    <node id="1. Circumstances of Alice's strange trance and waking: In Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; Matthew Maule puts Alice Pyncheon into a trance-like state using an upward gesture of his hands while claiming that she is &quot;fairly mine.&quot; After Maule leaves, Alice awakens from her trance without any recollection of the experience. She instantly assumes a cold but gentle demeanor when recognizing Matthew Maule.&#10;   &#10;2. Inferred relationship between Alice Pyncheon and Matthew Maule: Matthew Maule has emotional and psychological control over Alice, who is unable to resist his manipulations due to his alleged subtle influence on the Pyncheon household and his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot; This power dynamic eventually leads to Alice's downfall as she becomes ill and dies after Maule haunts her in her dreams due to her confrontational attitude towards him.&#10;&#10;In summary, Matthew Maule puts Alice Pyncheon into a trance through an upward gesture of his hands. Upon waking, Alice resumes her normal behavior without any recollection of the experience. Matthew Maule is a carpenter who believes in his subtle influence over the Pyncheon household due to his grandfather's alleged curse on the family. He sees Alice as a means to tap into that influence and maintain control, given her &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the observations of the carpenter, we can discern that the family mansion is in a very good condition, with no signs of disrepair. The peaks are sharp, the roof looks water-tight, and the plaster-work on the exterior walls sparkles like new. This indicates that the kinsman responsible for maintaining the house has done an excellent job.&#10;&#10;The mansion appears to be bustling with activity, which suggests a large family living within its walls. The carpenter observes a huge load of oak-wood being brought into the outbuildings at the rear, and mentions seeing the &quot;fat cook&quot; or perhaps the housekeeper, indicating that there is plenty of work going on to keep the household running smoothly. All these observations point to a well-maintained and active household." />
    <node id=".  During this period, the&#10;   family mansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman, who was&#10;   allowed to make it his home for the time being, in consideration of&#10;   keeping the premises in thorough repair.  So faithfully had this&#10;   contract been fulfilled, that now, as the carpenter approached the&#10;   house, his practised eye could detect nothing to criticise in its&#10;   condition.  The peaks of the seven gables rose up sharply; the shingled&#10;   roof looked thoroughly water-tight; and the glittering plaster-work&#10;   entirely covered the exterior walls, and sparkled in the October sun,&#10;   as if it had been new only a week ago.&#10;&#10;   The house had that pleasant aspect of life which is like the cheery&#10;   expression of comfortable activity in the human countenance.  You could&#10;   see, at once, that there was the stir of a large family within it.  A&#10;   huge load of oak-wood was passing through the gateway, towards the&#10;   outbuildings in the rear; the fat cook--or probably it might be the&#10;   house" />
    <node id="In the narrative, it is suggested that Matthew Maule needs to engage in a &quot;lawful investigation&quot; with Alice, Mr. Pyncheon's daughter, to uncover the missing document. While specific actions are not mentioned, Mr. Pyncheon agrees to allow this investigation to take place, despite his initial haughty response. This implies that Matthew Maule must work within the bounds of the law and cooperate with Alice in order to find the lost document, according to Mr. Pyncheon's conditions." />

    <node id="Alice's faint exclamation, &quot;Oh, Mr. Maule!&quot; signifies her sudden recognition of Matthew Maule as the person who put her in a trance earlier. This exclamation indicates that she is now aware of his influence over her and contributes to the tension in the room by highlighting the power imbalance between them.&#10;&#10;Maule's behavior during this scene also heightens the tension. He intentionally puts Alice into a trance-like state, exerting emotional and psychological control over her. The upward gesture of his hands when claiming she is &quot;fairly mine&quot; reinforces his belief in his subtle influence on the Pyncheon household due to his alleged curse on the family. By making an invisible weight descend upon Alice while uplifting his arms, Maule further emphasizes his supposed power over her and adds to the eerie atmosphere, which disturbs Mr. Pyncheon.&#10;&#10;In this context, it is also essential to consider that the community believes Maule's grandfather was a wizard. The legacy of hatred against the Pyncheons combined with Matthew Maule's behavior creates an aura of suspicion and unease in the room, fueling the building tension. Overall, Alice's faint exclamation and Maule's behavior reveal the power imbalance, manipulation, and supernatural elements at play, contributing to the increasing anxiety in the scene." />

Alice sat in an attitude of profound repose, with the&#10;    long brown lashes drooping over her eyes.&#10;&#10;    &quot;There she is!&quot; said the carpenter.  &quot;Speak to her!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Alice! My daughter!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon.  &quot;My own Alice!&quot;&#10;&#10;    She did not stir.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Louder!&quot; said Maule, smiling.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Alice!

But the sound&#10;    evidently reached her not.  It is indescribable what a sense of remote,&#10;    dim, unattainable distance betwixt himself and Alice was impressed on&#10;" />
    <node id="Alice faintly calls for help because she feels overwhelmed by Matthew Maule's gestures and the pressure of being involved in his search for the missing document. The narrative suggests that Maule is using some sort of psychological manipulation or perhaps even making her uncomfortable with his physical presence, as indicated by Mr. Pyncheon observing Maule making a gesture &quot;as if directing downward a slow, ponderous, and invisible weight upon the maiden.&quot;&#10;&#10;When informed about his daughter's distress, Mr. Pyncheon reacts with anger and haughtiness, demanding that Matthew Maule stop his actions. He expresses confusion about why his daughter needs to be involved in this matter, emphasizing his protective stance towards her safety and well-being. Mr. Pyncheon's scruples also arise from the implication that Matthew Maule might exercise an influence over Alice similar to what was once referred to as witchcraft, invoking the historical context of their ancestors' conflict." />

This bondage is primarily due to two factors:&#10;&#10;1.

Matthew Maule's alleged subtle influence over the Pyncheon household, which stems from the community's belief that his grandfather, accused of witchcraft, had cursed the Pyncheon family: Matthew Maule capitalizes on this belief and manipulates Alice into feeling that she is &quot;fairly mine&quot; and will remember him.&#10;&#10;As a result of these factors, Matthew Maule is able to control Alice's emotions and actions by:&#10;&#10;- Compelling her to attend his wedding despite her reluctance and humiliation&#10;- Influencing her desire to change her nature and feel as lowly as a worm due to her susceptibility&#10;- Making Alice believe that she is necessary for acquiring the requisite knowledge&#10;- Causing Alice's father, Mr. Pyncheon, to overlook social conventions and make financial offers to Matthew Maule in pursuit of an important document&#10;&#10;These manipulations show how Matthew Maule exerts emotional and psychological control over Alice Pyncheon, creating a bondage that significantly impacts her life and relationships within the novel.">

The family traditions and legal advisers believe that Colonel Pyncheon was in possession of some deed or other document that was crucial for this claim but has since disappeared. The fact that the document is missing indicates that someone might have taken it or destroyed it deliberately, or it could be lost or misplaced accidentally.&#10;&#10;3.

The carpenter, Matthew Maule, is preventing Mr. Pyncheon from gaining custody of the secret because he believes that there is a &quot;mysterious connection and dependence&quot; between his family and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. This belief stems from the popular legend that Maule's grandfather, who was accused of witchcraft, had cursed the Pyncheon family. Matthew thinks that he can exercise some subtle influence over the Pyncheon household through this connection, and he sees Alice as a way to tap into that influence. He insists that she is necessary for acquiring the requisite knowledge due to his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; to serve as a clear medium for discovering hidden truths or information.&#10;&#10;2. Mr. Pyncheon's blood relation to Maule plays a significant role in their confrontation because Matthew claims that he has subtle influence over the Pyncheon household through his grandfather's curse. The community also supports these claims, believing in a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. This belief adds weight to Matthew's demands and makes Mr. Pyncheon more cautious about opposing him directly.&#10;&#10;In summary, the carpenter, Matthew Maule, is preventing Mr. Pyncheon from gaining custody of the secret because he believes that he has a subtle influence over the Pyncheon household due to his family's alleged connection to the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. This belief stems from the popular legend that Maule's grandfather, who was accused of witchcraft, had cursed the Pyncheon family. Mr. Pyncheon's blood relation to Maule adds a layer of complexity to their confrontation, as Matthew's claims of subtle influence are taken more seriously due to their familial connection.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative provided, there is a thematic connection between the rumors about the stolen right hand of the wizard's skeleton and Matthew Maule's father's activities in Colonel Pyncheon's private room before his death. The connection lies in the popular belief that the Maules have some mysterious connection to the vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, including the missing papers. This belief stems from rumors suggesting that the wizard had obtained the best end of his contest with Colonel Pyncheon by possessing the great Eastern claim.&#10;&#10;The narrative mentions that Matthew Maule's father was believed to have performed some job in Colonel Pyncheon's private room on the day before or possibly the very morning of the Colonel's decease, when papers belonging to him were spread out on the table. Although it is not explicitly stated that Matthew Maule's father had anything to do with the missing papers belonging to Colonel Pyncheon, there is a suggestion in the narrative that he might have been involved or at least present when the documents were accessible.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no definitive proof of Matthew Maule's father being connected to the stolen right hand or the missing papers, there are thematic connections and rumors suggesting a possible involvement due to the belief in a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions." target="1. Colonel Pyncheon had confidently anticipated success in his Eastern claim, which indicates that he had some form of substantial evidence or documents to support this claim. However, such grounds were not apparent to his heirs. This suggests that the colonel might have kept the essential document secret or hidden it away from others' knowledge.&#10;&#10;2. The family traditions and legal advisers believe that Colonel Pyncheon was in possession of some deed or other document that was crucial for this claim but has since disappeared. The fact that the document is missing indicates that someone might have taken it or destroyed it deliberately, or it could be lost or misplaced accidentally.&#10;&#10;3. There are rumors and popular beliefs suggesting a mysterious connection between the Maule family and the vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, including the missing papers. Matthew Maule's father was present in Colonel Pyncheon's private room before his death when papers belonging to him were spread out on the table. It is possible that he might have had access to or knowledge about the whereabouts of the essential document related to the Eastern claim, especially considering the recent discovery of the missing right hand in the wizard's grave.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is no definitive evidence pointing to what happened to Colonel Pyncheon's essential document for his Eastern claim, rumors and thematic connections suggest a possible involvement of Matthew Maule's father due to the belief in a mysterious connection between the Maules and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions. It is plausible that the missing right hand from the wizard's grave could have some relevance to this situation, hinting at a hidden truth waiting to be uncovered.">

She instantly assumes a cold but gentle demeanor when recognizing Matthew Maule.&#10;   &#10;2. Inferred relationship between Alice Pyncheon and Matthew Maule: Matthew Maule has emotional and psychological control over Alice, who is unable to resist his manipulations due to his alleged subtle influence on the Pyncheon household and his belief in the power of a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence.&quot; This power dynamic eventually leads to Alice's downfall as she becomes ill and dies after Maule haunts her in her dreams due to her confrontational attitude towards him.&#10;&#10;In summary, Matthew Maule puts Alice Pyncheon into a trance through an upward gesture of his hands. Upon waking, Alice resumes her normal behavior without any recollection of the experience.

By making an invisible weight descend upon Alice while uplifting his arms, Maule further emphasizes his supposed power over her and adds to the eerie atmosphere, which disturbs Mr. Pyncheon.&#10;&#10;In this context, it is also essential to consider that the community believes Maule's grandfather was a wizard. The legacy of hatred against the Pyncheons combined with Matthew Maule's behavior creates an aura of suspicion and unease in the room, fueling the building tension.

    <node id="Based on the alien manual and Lin's description, farn beasts are carnivorous creatures that inhabit the planet where the story takes place. They have two very long, sharp fangs, and when enraged, they are capable of tearing apart an &quot;alien,&quot; which suggests that their strength is significant enough to consider them dangerous. Lin mentions that farn beasts are particularly hostile towards humans or &quot;aliens,&quot; making them a threat to the explorers on this planet. The manual describes the farn beasts as the &quot;particular enemy of men&quot; or aliens.&#10;&#10;The sounds they make include coughs, which seem to be a way of communication or a signal to others in the vicinity. Their physical characteristics and behavior suggest that they are agile creatures, able to charge through water and pursue their prey. The farn beasts' movements and actions indicate some level of intelligence, allowing them to set up traps for their prey.&#10;&#10;In terms of diet, the farn beasts are undoubtedly carnivorous, as stated in the alien manual and corroborated by Lin's description. They appear to view humans or aliens as potential prey, making them a significant risk to the explorers on this planet." />

He smacked his lips wetly. &quot;Very ludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen for guides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me, twenty years ago, damn them.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lin waited.&#10; &#10; &quot;Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The farn beasts are dangerous, sir,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Eh?

Of tearing an alien to pieces, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone laughed harshly. &quot;It's 'sir' whenever you contradict me?&quot;&#10; &#10; Lin's face remained impassive. &quot;I guess it seems that way. Sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Damned few people would dare go as far as you do,&quot; Extrone said. &quot;But you're afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Lin shrugged. &quot;Maybe.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I can see you are. Even my wives are.

It's the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as I was saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, of aliens. Sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Extrone said, annoyed. &quot;I'll be careful.&quot;&#10; &#10; In the distance, a farn beast coughed.&#10; &#10; Instantly alert, Extrone said, &quot;Get the bearers! Have some of them cut a path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get the hell over here!&quot;&#10; &#10; Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Four hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked leisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at the vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their sharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy breathing.&#10; &#10; Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for" />

He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath beginning to sound like an asthmatic pump.&#10; &#10; The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look!&quot; Extrone cried excitedly. &quot;Here it comes!&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri began to scream again.&#10; &#10; Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin waited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination.&#10; &#10; The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing a sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri.&#10; &#10; &quot;Watch! Watch!&quot; Extrone cried gleefully.&#10; &#10; And then the aliens sprang their trap." />
    <node id=" spoor.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lin said, &quot;We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone laughed. &quot;This is enough.&quot; He gestured with the rifle and stood up.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; &quot;One is enough in my camp.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The two of them went forward, alone, into the forest. Extrone moved agilely through the tangle, following Lin closely. When they came to the tracks, heavily pressed into drying mud around a small watering hole, Extrone nodded his head in satisfaction.&#10; &#10; &quot;This way,&quot; Lin said, pointing, and once more the two of them started off.&#10; &#10; They went a good distance through the forest, Extrone becoming more alert with each additional foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with a restraining hand. &quot;They may be quite a way ahead. Hadn't we ought to bring up the column?&quot;&#10; &#10; The farn beast, somewhere beyond a ragged clump of bushes, coughed. Extrone clenched the blast rifle convulsively.&#10; &#10; The farn beast coughed again, more distant" />
    <node id="hed, far in the matted forest.&#10; &#10; Extrone laughed nervously. &quot;He must have heard.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We're lucky to rouse one so fast,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; Extrone dug his boot cleats into the tree, braced himself. &quot;I like this. There's more excitement in waiting like this than in anything I know.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lin nodded.&#10; &#10; &quot;The waiting, itself, is a lot. The suspense. It's not only the killing that matters.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's not only the killing,&quot; Lin echoed.&#10; &#10; &quot;You understand?&quot; Extrone said. &quot;How it is to wait, knowing in just a minute something is going to come out of the forest, and you're going to kill it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; &quot;But it's not only the killing. It's the waiting, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; The farn beast coughed again; nearer.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's a different one,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; &quot;How do you know?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hear the lower pitch, the more of a roar?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey!&quot; Extrone shouted. &quot;You" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Ri has located signs of the farn beast through the coughing roar that he heard. He correctly identified it as a farn beast and informed Extrone about it. Extrone was glad to hear this because it meant they wouldn't have to cross the ridge, and they could hunt the farn beast the next day. Extrone also mentioned that he had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter. Therefore, Ri's report of the farn beast's presence was significant, and Extrone made the decision to camp in that location and hunt the farn beast the next day." />

Listen to me.&quot; Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands were trembling. &quot;It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir. He killed a farn beast before I did, sir. And last night—last night, he—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He what?&quot; Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.&#10; &#10; Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. &quot;He said he ought to kill you, sir. That's what he said" />
    <node id=" they're on this side of the ridge, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; Delicately, Extrone raised a hand to his beard. &quot;I'd hate to lose a day crossing the ridge,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Ri said. Suddenly he threw back his head. &quot;Listen!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Eh?&quot; Extrone said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hear it? That cough? I think that's one, from over there. Right up ahead of us.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone raised his eyebrows.&#10; &#10; This time, the coughing roar was more distant, but distinct.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is!&quot; Ri said. &quot;It's a farn beast, all right!&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone smiled, almost pointed teeth showing through the beard. &quot;I'm glad we won't have to cross the ridge.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri wiped his forehead on the back of his sleeve. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll pitch camp right here, then,&quot; Extrone said. &quot;We'll go after it tomorrow.&quot; He looked at the sky. &quot;Have the bearers hurry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. &quot;You, there!&quot;" />
    <node id=" guide.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It was an honor, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. &quot;If I had waited until it was safe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able to find such an illustrious guide.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... I'm flattered, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; Extrone said. &quot;But you should have spoken to me about it, when you discovered the farn beast in our own system.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity, sir....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; Extrone said dryly. &quot;Like all of my subjects,&quot; he waved his hand in a broad gesture, &quot;the highest as well as the lowest slave, know me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri squirmed, his face pale. &quot;We do indeed love you, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone bent forward. &quot; Know me and love me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir. Know you and love you, sir,&quot; Ri said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Get out!&quot; Extrone said.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's frightening,&quot;" />
    <node id=" The floor, heavy, portable tile blocks, not the hollow kind, were neatly and smoothly inset into the ground. Hanging from the center, to the left of the slender, hand-carved center pole, was a chain of crystals. They tinkled lightly when Extrone dropped the flap. The light was electric from a portable dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He crossed to the bed, sat down.&#10; &#10; &quot;You were, I believe, the first ever to kill a farn beast?&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I.... No, sir. There must have been previous hunters, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Extrone narrowed his eyes. &quot;I see by your eyes that you are envious—that is the word, isn't it?—of my tent.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri looked away from his face.&#10; &#10; &quot;Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I have never killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't seen a farn beast.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone's glittering ones. &quot;Few people have seen them, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh?&quot; Extrone questioned" />
    <node id=" like this at a hunt.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I feel it,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; Extrone chuckled. &quot;You were with me on Meizque?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That was something, that time.&quot; He ran his hand along the stock of the weapon.&#10; &#10; The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled Extrone's head. He slapped at it, angry. The forest was quiet, underlined by an occasional piping call, something like a whistle. Ri's screams were shrill, echoing away, shiveringly. Lin sat quiet, hunched.&#10; &#10; Extrone's eyes narrowed, and he began to pet the gun stock with quick, jerky movements. Lin licked his lips, keeping his eyes on Extrone's face. The sun seemed stuck in the sky, and the heat squeezed against them, sucking at their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away. Still, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A farn beast coughed, far in the matted forest.&#10; &#10; Extrone laughed nervously. &quot;He must have heard.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We're lucky to r" />

The pilot must have been the one who told Extrone we'd hunted this area.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going to the alien system?

He may have sent a spy in.&quot;&#10; &#10; They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were not professional guides.&#10; &#10; &quot;We don't want to get too near,&quot; Ri said after toiling through the forest for many minutes. &quot;Without guns, we don't want to get near enough for the farn beast to charge us.&quot;&#10; &#10; They stopped.

We're not—not just anybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even him . And besides, why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Too many people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mia said, &quot;I hope you're right.&quot; They stood side by side, studying the blast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, &quot;We better be getting back.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What'll we tell him?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?&quot;&#10; &#10; They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.&#10; &#10; &quot;It gets hotter at sunset,&quot; Ri said nervously.&#10; &#10; &quot;The breeze dies down.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;" />

Before them lay a blast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, but the tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath.&#10; &#10; &quot;This isn't ours!&quot; Ri said. &quot;This looks like it was made nearly a year ago!&quot;&#10; &#10; Mia's eyes narrowed. &quot;The military from Xnile?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Ri said. &quot;They don't have any rockets this small. And I don't think there's another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one we leased from the Club. Except the one he brought.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place?&quot; Mia asked. &quot;You think it's their blast?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So?&quot; Ri said. &quot;But who are they?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was Mia's turn to shrug. &quot;Whoever they were, they couldn't have been hunters.

They were spruce, the officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and knees almost stiff.&#10; &#10; &quot;What in hell do you want?&quot; Extrone asked.&#10; &#10; They stopped a respectful distance away. &quot;Sir....&quot; one began.&#10; &#10; &quot;Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?&quot; Extrone demanded, ominously not raising his voice.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sir,&quot; the lead officer said, &quot;it's another alien ship. It was sighted a few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone's face looked much too innocent. &quot;How did it get there, gentlemen?

There must be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There may be a pass,&quot; Mia said, pushing a vine away.&#10; &#10; Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. &quot;I guess that's it. If there were a lot of them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it's damned funny, when you think about it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mia looked up at the darkening sky. &quot;We better hurry,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low, obviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the outpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the blazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet.

While waiting for the march to resume, he sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted, reflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.&#10; &#10; &quot;For you, sir,&quot; the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn,&quot; Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. &quot;It better be important.&quot; He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The bearer twiddled the dials.&#10; &#10; &quot;Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother me?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Blasted them right out of space,&quot; the voice crackled excitedly. &quot;Right in the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!&quot; Extrone tore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. &quot;" />

Temporarily, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So?&quot; Extrone mocked.&#10; &#10; &quot;We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could locate and destroy it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned away, in the direction of a resting bearer. &quot;You!&quot; he said. &quot;Hey! Bring me a drink!&quot; He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. &quot;I'm staying here.&quot;&#10; &#10; The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. &quot;But, sir....&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone toyed with his beard. &quot;About a year ago, gentlemen, there was an alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it, didn't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll destroy this one, too,&quot; Extrone said.&#10; &#10; &quot;We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through.

The Army put him in power when the people were in rebellion against military rule.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Ri swallowed. &quot;We couldn't make the people believe that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No?&quot; Mia challenged. &quot;Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow? You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the alien system!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The people won't support them,&quot; Ri answered woodenly.&#10; &#10; &quot; Think.

    <node id="The tense and anxious situation that Lin and Extrone are in is evident through their behavior and the events taking place in the story. Lin is quiet and hunched, indicating his anxiety or apprehension. Extrone's jerky movements, nervous laughter, and hand-petting of the gun stock suggest his growing tension as they wait for the farn beasts to appear. Ri's screams echoing through the forest add to the anxious atmosphere, making it clear that the characters are in a dangerous and uncertain situation. The distant coughing of a farn beast adds to their anxiety, reminding them of the imminent threat." />
    <node id=". &quot;People should hunt because they have to. For food. For safety.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Extrone argued. &quot;People should hunt for the love of hunting.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Killing?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hunting,&quot; Extrone repeated harshly.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and there was a noise of crackling underbrush.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's good bait,&quot; Extrone said. &quot;He's fat enough and he knows how to scream good.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully eying the forest across from the watering hole.&#10; &#10; Extrone began to tremble with excitement. &quot;Here they come!&quot;&#10; &#10; The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his lap.&#10; &#10; The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank, swinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed. Its mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs behind them, rattling leaves.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shoot!&quot; Lin hissed. &quot;" />
    <node id="&#10; Extrone nodded genially. &quot;The farn beast hunter, eh?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. &quot;Tell me what they look like,&quot; he said suddenly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, sir, they're ... uh....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Pretty frightening?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, sir....

Lin's face was impassive.&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course you will,&quot; Extrone said genially. &quot;Get me a rope, Lin. A good, long, strong rope.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Ri asked, terrified.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as bait.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, come now.

    <node id="Captain Extrone is insisting on staying on the planet because he believes that he is safe there and that the military would lose a fleet before allowing anything to happen to him. He thinks that the alien ship probably doesn't know he's there, and even if they did, they wouldn't be able to hit the area. He also feels that they can't afford to let the aliens get a shot at him. Extrone plans to destroy the alien ship by allowing it to engage in a long-range bombardment, which he believes would not be accurate enough to harm him or his camp. The tight patrol is in place to ensure that the alien ship does not slip through and launch a surprise attack on Extrone's location." />
    <node id=" sir. It can't slip through. But it might try a long range bombardment, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Extrone said, &quot;To begin with, they probably don't even know I'm here. And they probably couldn't hit this area if they did know. And you can't afford to let them get a shot at me, anyway.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's why we'd like you to return to an inner planet, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; Extrone plucked at his right ear lobe, half closing his eyes. &quot;You'll lose a fleet before you'll dare let anything happen to me, gentlemen. I'm quite safe here, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; The bearer brought Extrone his drink.&#10; &#10; &quot;Get off,&quot; Extrone said quietly to the four officers.&#10; &#10; Again they turned reluctantly. This time, he did not call them back. Instead, with amusement, he watched until they disappeared into the tangle of forest.&#10; &#10; Dusk was falling. The takeoff blast of the rocket illuminated the area, casting weird shadows on the gently swaying grasses; there was a hot breath of dry air and the rocket dwindled toward the stars.&#10; &#10; Extrone stood up lazily," />
    <node id="Based on Extrone's behavior towards his guides and the farn beasts, several observations can be made:&#10;&#10;1. Extrone is dismissive of the alien manual that contains essential information about the farn beasts. He considers it &quot;ludicrous&quot; that they have to rely on an external source for knowledge about their newly discovered fauna, showing his arrogance and lack of respect for other sources of wisdom.&#10;2. Extrone is aware of the power dynamics between him and his guides. He acknowledges that businessmen would have looked down upon him 20 years ago, but now he can assert dominance over them. This suggests a narcissistic personality who enjoys having control over others.&#10;3. Despite being warned about the dangers of farn beasts by Lin and the manual, Extrone underestimates their threat. He even considers using Ri as bait to lure the beasts, showing his recklessness and lack of empathy for others' well-being.&#10;4. Extrone's behavior towards the farn beasts reveals his eagerness for a thrilling hunting experience. When they finally come across tracks, he expresses satisfaction and insists on going further into the forest alone with Lin. This shows his inclination towards risky activities and disregard for safety precautions.&#10;5. Extrone's constant corrections of Lin when contradicted indicate his desire to assert dominance in their relationship. He wants to prove that he is in charge, which can also be seen in his decision not to bring additional weapons or allow more people to join them during the hunt." />
    <node id="1. Signs of the farn beast have been located through the coughing roar that Ri heard. He correctly identified it as a farn beast and informed Extrone about its presence.&#10;2. Ri was invited into Extrone's luxurious tent after mentioning that he had killed a farn beast on his trip because Extrone had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter. Extrone likely wanted to learn more about the farn beasts and Ri's hunting experiences from the firsthand account of someone who had actually killed one. Additionally, inviting Ri into his tent could have been a gesture of respect or appreciation for Ri's hunting skills and knowledge." />
    <node id="1. Extrone did not shoot the lead farn beast that was heading towards Ri, even though Lin urged him to do so. Instead, he waited and watched as the farn beast plunged into the water and headed towards Ri. This was unexpected because it seemed like Extrone had the opportunity to hunt the farn beast, but he chose not to take it.&#10;2. It was later revealed that Extrone had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter. He likely wanted to see the farn beast in action and witness its ferocity for himself. This is why he did not shoot it immediately and instead chose to observe it.&#10;3. The aliens then sprang their trap, which was not detailed in the story. It is unclear what happened to Ri or the farn beast, but it is clear that Extrone's refusal to shoot the lead farn beast led to an unexpected turn of events." />
    <node id="The communications man delivered the news that their military rocket had blasted another alien ship out of space. However, Extrone dismisses him because he is more focused on his hunting expedition and doesn't want to be bothered with this news." />
    <node id="The passage describes a hunting expedition led by a character named Extrone. The scene shifts between Extrone's preoccupation with his hunt and the ongoing conflict with alien ships invading their space. The bearers, who are subordinates to Extrone, are attentive to his needs and quick to respond, even in tense situations. This is demonstrated when Extrone demands breakfast upon waking up. The bearers promptly set up a table, bring food and drink, and serve him despite the uncertainty and danger presented by the invading alien ships.&#10;&#10;The peaceful and nostalgic atmosphere of the morning contrasts sharply with Extrone's demanding attitude and the tension surrounding the invasion. The description of birds singing, dew on the ground, and breakfast smells creates a sense of normalcy and tranquility, which is in stark contrast to Extrone's preoccupation with hunting and his irritation at being interrupted by news of the alien ships.&#10;&#10;The significance of this scene lies in the portrayal of Extrone's character and priorities. Despite the seriousness of the situation with the invading aliens, he remains focused on his hunt and expects others to cater to his needs. The bearers' quick response to his demands for breakfast highlights their subservient role and willingness to prioritize his needs above their own. This scene also emphasizes the contrast between the peaceful morning atmosphere and the tension surrounding the invasion, which serves to heighten the dramatic effect of the story." />

I know you're wrong.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mia smiled twistedly. &quot;How many has he already killed? How can we even guess?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri swallowed sickly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri shuddered. &quot;That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all like that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; With morning came birds' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells. The air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike, uncontaminated.&#10; &#10; And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting the flap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared around the camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep.&#10; &#10; &quot;Breakfast!&quot; he shouted, and two bearers came running with a folding table and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray of various foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcher and a drinking mug.&#10; &#10; Extrone ate hugely, with" />
    <node id="1. Extrone believes that the purpose of hunting is for the love of hunting, while Lin disagrees and thinks that people should hunt only for food and safety. This difference in beliefs becomes evident when Extrone refuses to shoot the lead farn beast, despite having the opportunity to do so, simply because he wants to observe it and see its ferocity for himself. Lin, on the other hand, believes that hunting should serve a practical purpose, such as providing food or protecting oneself from danger, and thinks that Extrone's actions are reckless and unnecessary.&#10;2. This difference in beliefs between Extrone and Lin is further highlighted when Extrone decides to use Ri as bait for the farn beasts. While Extrone sees this as a thrilling hunting experience, Lin remains quiet and hunched, seemingly uncomfortable with the situation. This suggests that Lin does not agree with Extrone's approach to hunting and believes that it is wrong to put someone in danger simply for the sake of a hunt.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Extrone and Lin have different beliefs about the purpose of hunting. While Extrone sees it as a thrilling and enjoyable activity, Lin believes that it should serve a practical purpose and not put anyone in danger unnecessarily. This difference in beliefs becomes evident throughout the story and leads to tension between the two characters." />
    <node id="The military rocket with the Ninth Fleet emblem is searching for a landing site near Extrone's tent because they have important news to deliver to him. Based on the story, the likely news they want to convey is about the sighting of another alien ship and discuss plans for dealing with it. This is evident when a group of four high-ranking officers comes out of the forest to inform Extrone about the sighting of another alien ship. However, Extrone seems uninterested in their news and more focused on hunting farn beasts in the area, as seen by his dismissive attitude towards the communications man who delivered the news." />
    <node id="1. The tense and anxious situation that Lin and Extrone are in is evident through their behavior and the events taking place in the story. They are waiting for farn beasts to appear, which adds to their anxiety. Ri's continuous screams echoing through the forest create a dangerous and uncertain atmosphere, making it clear that they are in a perilous situation. The distant coughing of a farn beast reminds them of the imminent threat. Lin's quietness and hunched position indicate his apprehension, while Extrone's jerky movements, nervous laughter, and hand-petting of the gun stock suggest his growing tension. Additionally, Extrone becomes angry when an insect circles his head, which could be a sign of his irritation or anxiety in the situation." />
    <node id=" I imagine.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri was almost slobbering in fear.&#10; &#10; &quot;Let me hear you scream,&quot; Extrone said.&#10; &#10; Ri moaned weakly.&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll have to do better than that.&quot; Extrone inclined his head toward a bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Ri screamed.&#10; &#10; &quot;See that you keep it up that way,&quot; Extrone said. &quot;That's the way I want you to sound.&quot; He turned toward Lin. &quot;We can climb this tree, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; Slowly, aided by the bearers, the two men climbed the tree, bark peeling away from under their rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly.&#10; &#10; Once at the crotch, Extrone settled down, holding the rifle at alert. Lin moved to the left, out on the main branch, rested in a smaller crotch.&#10; &#10; Looking down, Extrone said, &quot;Scream!&quot; Then, to Lin, &quot;You feel the excitement? It's always in the air like this at a hunt.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I feel it,&quot; Lin said.&#10; &#10; Extrone chuckled. &quot;You were with me on Meiz" />

However, Mia suspects that the army actually helped him gain power and is now planning to invade an alien system. Ri and Mia are worried because they believe this powerful individual will kill anyone who threatens his control, and they fear that their knowledge of the farn beasts and the army's plans could make them targets.&#10;&#10;Mia believes that when the invasion starts, this individual will have to command all the loyalties of the army in order to prevent another rebellion. She thinks that people would be more likely to believe them about the true nature of this individual's intentions at that point, but Ri is more optimistic and believes they will be safe. Nonetheless, they are both clearly anxious about the situation and the power that this unnamed individual wields.&#10;&#10;They also mention that they won't be able to convince people of the truth due to the propaganda and manipulation that has been used to control public opinion. Ri believes that even if they tried to tell people, no one would believe them because of everything they have been led to believe about this individual and the army.&#10;&#10;Overall, Ri and Mia are discussing their concerns about the powerful individual taking away their civilization and the role of the army in this situation, including the invasion of an alien system and the potential danger that they face as individuals who have knowledge of the farn beasts and the army's plans." />

They trust him.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri looked around at the shadows.&#10; &#10; &quot;That explains a lot of things,&quot; Mia said. &quot;I think the Army's been preparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's why Extrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them from learning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keep them from exposing him to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooled like we were, so easy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; Ri snapped. &quot;It was to keep the natural economic balance.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You know that's not right.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ri lay down on his bed roll. &quot;Don't talk about it. It's not good to talk like this. I don't even want to listen.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;When the invasion starts, he'll have to command all their loyalties. To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then. He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying to tell the truth.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you" />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, Extrone seems to view hunting as a thrilling and enjoyable activity that involves more than just killing. He enjoys the suspense and excitement of waiting for the farn beast to appear, as indicated by his nervous laughter and comments about the waiting being part of the experience. He also appears to have a fascination with farn beasts, as he has never seen one before and seems envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter.&#10;2. Lin, on the other hand, seems to view hunting from a more practical standpoint. While he acknowledges the excitement of waiting for the farn beast to appear, he also emphasizes the importance of being prepared to take action when it does. His response to Extrone's question about understanding the experience of waiting and killing suggests that he views hunting as a serious matter that requires focus and concentration. However, his discomfort with using Ri as bait and his quietness during the tense situation also suggest that he may have reservations about the ethics or safety of certain hunting practices." />
    <node id="In the morning, Extrone is shown to be excited and eager for the hunt, expressing his desire to observe the ferocity of the farn beast and even using Ri as bait to attract the creatures. His behavior during this time can be described as thrill-seeking and reckless, with little regard for the safety of others.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, when Mia, Ri, and their unnamed companion are discussing someone who has a history of killing, the atmosphere among them is tense and ominous. They speak in hushed tones, and there is a sense of unease and apprehension as they talk about this mysterious figure. The contrast between Extrone's behavior in the morning and the tense atmosphere among Mia, Ri, and their companion can be attributed to the difference in their perspectives on hunting.&#10;&#10;Extrone sees hunting as a thrilling and enjoyable activity that involves more than just killing, while Mia, Ri, and their companion view it from a more practical standpoint, emphasizing the importance of being prepared to take action when necessary and being mindful of safety concerns. This difference in perspectives creates a tension between Extrone and the others, as his reckless behavior and disregard for safety put them at risk during the hunt." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Ri is pleading with Extrone to be used as bait instead of Mia because he believes that Mia poses a greater threat to Extrone's safety. The story mentions that Mia had killed a farn beast before Ri did and that he allegedly expressed a desire to harm Extrone. This, combined with the tense atmosphere among Mia, Ri, and their unnamed companion when discussing someone who has a history of killing, suggests that Mia may be dangerous or unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Ri, on the other hand, appears to be more safety-conscious and is concerned for his own well-being as well as Extrone's. By volunteering to be used as bait, Ri likely believes that he can better protect himself and Extrone from any potential harm that Mia may cause.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the story does not explicitly confirm whether Mia actually expressed a desire to harm Extrone or if Ri is misrepresenting the situation for his own benefit. However, based on the information provided, it seems likely that Ri believes Mia poses a greater threat than he does and is therefore trying to protect himself and Extrone by volunteering to be used as bait." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, Extrone believes that people should hunt for the love of hunting because he views it as a thrilling and enjoyable activity that involves more than just killing. He enjoys the suspense and excitement of waiting for the farn beast to appear, as indicated by his nervous laughter and comments about the waiting being part of the experience. He also appears to have a fascination with farn beasts, as he has never seen one before and seems envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter. Extrone's trembling with excitement at the sight of a farn beast shows his passion and enthusiasm for hunting, which stems from his love of the activity rather than necessity or safety." />
    <node id="Based on the story, Mia suspects that the pilot is the one who revealed their hunting location to Extrone. This suspicion arises due to the pilot's dislike for businessmen and his animosity towards the Hunting Club, which Extrone is a part of. Mia also mentions that they should have shot the pilot instead of their guide, suggesting that he believes the pilot's actions were intentional and harmful to their hunting expedition." />
    <node id="1. Extrone became angry when he found out that the communications man had interrupted him during his hunt because he was more focused on hunting at that moment and did not want to be bothered with other news.&#10;2. He dismisses the importance of their military victory over the alien ship, stating &quot;I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!&quot; indicating his priority and interest at that time was hunting and not military matters.&#10;3. Additionally, Extrone may have also been annoyed by the interruption because he was expecting news related to the hunt or their hunting location, as suggested by Mia's suspicion about the pilot revealing their location to Extrone." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Ri offers to pay Lin to protect him during his upcoming meeting with Extrone. Ri is worried and unhappy about the meeting, and he asks Lin if he can prevent Extrone from doing anything harmful to him. Ri offers to pay Lin for this service, indicating that he is willing to spend money to ensure his own safety. This suggests that Ri perceives himself to be in danger during the meeting with Extrone and is taking steps to protect himself." />

One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously at Lin's bare forearm. &quot;Look,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You know him. I have—a little money. If you were able to ... if he wants,&quot; Ri gulped, &quot;to do anything to me—I'd pay you, if you could....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You better come along,&quot; Lin said, turning.&#10; &#10; Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound, ineffectual.

The reason Captain Extrone and his men have decided to camp and pursue their hunt for the farn beast the next day instead of crossing the ridge is that Ri, one of their team members, has located signs of the farn beast through the coughing roar that he heard. Ri correctly identified it as a farn beast and informed Extrone about its presence. This was significant because it meant they wouldn't have to cross the ridge, and they could hunt the farn beast the next day. Additionally, Extrone had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter, further contributing to his decision to camp and hunt in that location." />

Additionally, Extrone had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter, contributing to his decision to camp and hunt in that location." />
    <node id="based on the story, Mia and Ri are in a precarious situation where they suspect the pilot may have revealed their hunting location to Extrone, and there's tension between them due to differing perspectives on hunting. Given that their only observation is seeing tracks, Mia and Ri should tell the truth when they return to the group. They can report that they found signs of the farn beast's presence, such as footprints or other indications that the creature has been in the area, without disclosing any specific location or details that could put them at risk. By focusing on providing useful information for the hunt while remaining cautious about what they reveal, Mia and Ri can mitigate some of the danger they face and maintain their credibility as competent guides." />
    <node id="The farn beasts are carnivorous creatures that inhabit the planet where the story takes place. They have two long, sharp fangs and are particularly hostile towards humans or &quot;aliens,&quot; making them a threat to the explorers on this planet. The manual describes them as the &quot;particular enemy of men&quot; or aliens. The farn beasts communicate through coughs, which seem to be a signal to others in their vicinity. They are agile creatures that can charge through water and pursue their prey. The farn beasts' movements and actions indicate some level of intelligence, allowing them to set up traps for their prey. According to the alien manual and Lin's description, they are undoubtedly carnivorous and view humans or aliens as potential prey.&#10;&#10;This information about the farn beasts comes from the dialogue between Extrone and Lin, as well as the alien manual that Lin refers to in their conversation." />
    <node id="1. Ri and Mia are facing several challenges as they navigate through the forest while trying to avoid detection from the individual they are evading:&#10;2. Uncertainty about whether their location has been compromised: The pilot's potential betrayal of their hunting location to Extrone puts them in a precarious situation, making them anxious and cautious about revealing any specific details that could put them at risk.&#10;3. Differing perspectives on hunting: Mia and Ri have different approaches to hunting the farn beast, leading to tension between them. They must work together despite their differences to ensure their safety.&#10;4. Difficulty in navigating the forest: Although they have prior knowledge and experience of the area, Ri and Mia are not professional hunters or guides. The dense forest and clinging vines create challenges for them as they try to make their way through.&#10;5. Fear of being targeted: Given their knowledge of the farn beasts and the army's plans, Ri and Mia believe they could be in danger if they return from their hunting trip. This fear adds to their anxiety and caution while navigating the forest.&#10;6. Danger from the farn beast: Ri and Mia must remain vigilant for signs of the farn beast's presence, such as footprints or other indications that the creature has been in the area. However, they do not want to get too close without guns, as it could put them in danger if the farn beast charges at them.&#10;7. Need for secrecy: They must avoid being detected by the person they are evading while trying to pick up tracks of the farn beast for their hunting party. This requires them to blaze the trees and create a path without drawing attention to themselves." />
    <node id="1. Ri is being pressured to serve as bait for the farn beast because he and the rest of the group believe that Mia poses a greater threat to Extrone's safety due to her history of killing a farn beast and allegedly expressing a desire to harm Extrone. By volunteering to serve as bait, Ri likely believes that he can better protect himself and Extrone from any potential harm that Mia may cause.&#10;2. The fact that Mia has killed a farn beast before Ri is relevant because it suggests that she may be more experienced or skilled at hunting farn beasts than Ri is. This, combined with the allegation that she expressed a desire to harm Extrone, makes her seem like a potential threat to the group's safety. Ri's offer to serve as bait may be an attempt to mitigate this perceived threat and protect both himself and Extrone." />
    <node id="Based on the conversation between Mia and Ri, it is suggested that the blast area in the forest was created by the same group of people who first discovered the farn beasts. This theory is supported by the fact that the blast looks like it was made nearly a year ago, which matches the timeline of when the farn beasts were first discovered. Additionally, Mia and Ri note that the blast doesn't match the military's rockets or the cargo rocket leased from the Club, suggesting that it must have been created by another group altogether. While they don't know who exactly these people are, they speculate that they couldn't have been hunters, as they would have kept the secret of the farn beasts better." />

The bearers promptly set up a table, bring food and drink, and serve him despite the uncertainty and danger presented by the invading alien ships.&#10;&#10;The peaceful and nostalgic atmosphere of the morning contrasts sharply with Extrone's demanding attitude and the tension surrounding the invasion.

Extrone believes that the purpose of hunting is for the love of hunting, while Lin disagrees and thinks that people should hunt only for food and safety. This difference in beliefs becomes evident when Extrone refuses to shoot the lead farn beast, despite having the opportunity to do so, simply because he wants to observe it and see its ferocity for himself. Lin, on the other hand, believes that hunting should serve a practical purpose, such as providing food or protecting oneself from danger, and thinks that Extrone's actions are reckless and unnecessary.&#10;2. This difference in beliefs between Extrone and Lin is further highlighted when Extrone decides to use Ri as bait for the farn beasts. While Extrone sees this as a thrilling hunting experience, Lin remains quiet and hunched, seemingly uncomfortable with the situation. This suggests that Lin does not agree with Extrone's approach to hunting and believes that it is wrong to put someone in danger simply for the sake of a hunt.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Extrone and Lin have different beliefs about the purpose of hunting. While Extrone sees it as a thrilling and enjoyable activity, Lin believes that it should serve a practical purpose and not put anyone in danger unnecessarily. This difference in beliefs becomes evident throughout the story and leads to tension between the two characters.">

The reason Captain Extrone and his men have decided to camp and pursue their hunt for the farn beast the next day instead of crossing the ridge is that Ri, one of their team members, has located signs of the farn beast through the coughing roar that he heard. Ri correctly identified it as a farn beast and informed Extrone about its presence. This was significant because it meant they wouldn't have to cross the ridge, and they could hunt the farn beast the next day. Additionally, Extrone had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter, further contributing to his decision to camp and hunt in that location.">

By volunteering to be used as bait, Ri likely believes that he can better protect himself and Extrone from any potential harm that Mia may cause.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the story does not explicitly confirm whether Mia actually expressed a desire to harm Extrone or if Ri is misrepresenting the situation for his own benefit. However, based on the information provided, it seems likely that Ri believes Mia poses a greater threat than he does and is therefore trying to protect himself and Extrone by volunteering to be used as bait.">

The bearers promptly set up a table, bring food and drink, and serve him despite the uncertainty and danger presented by the invading alien ships.&#10;&#10;The peaceful and nostalgic atmosphere of the morning contrasts sharply with Extrone's demanding attitude and the tension surrounding the invasion.

This was significant because it meant they wouldn't have to cross the ridge, and they could hunt the farn beast the next day. Additionally, Extrone had never seen a farn beast before and seemed envious of Ri's reputation as a hunter, further contributing to his decision to camp and hunt in that location.">

The bearers promptly set up a table, bring food and drink, and serve him despite the uncertainty and danger presented by the invading alien ships.&#10;&#10;The peaceful and nostalgic atmosphere of the morning contrasts sharply with Extrone's demanding attitude and the tension surrounding the invasion.

Despite the seriousness of the situation with the invading aliens, he remains focused on his hunt and expects others to cater to his needs.

They have two long, sharp fangs and are particularly hostile towards humans or &quot;aliens,&quot; making them a threat to the explorers on this planet. The manual describes them as the &quot;particular enemy of men&quot; or aliens. The farn beasts communicate through coughs, which seem to be a signal to others in their vicinity. They are agile creatures that can charge through water and pursue their prey. The farn beasts' movements and actions indicate some level of intelligence, allowing them to set up traps for their prey.

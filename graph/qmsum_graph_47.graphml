    <node id="1. Current status of reducing delay in the silence detector: Based on the conversation, it appears that PhD C and their team are still working on reducing the delay of the silence detector. They had been working on this issue two days prior to the meeting. However, there seems to be a constraint in implementing a silence detector on the server side due to delays.&#10;&#10;2. Potential benefits of using a low-pass filter cepstrum: Professor B mentioned that they have observed some results with a low-pass filter cepstrum, and it appears to have a small positive impact in certain places. While it may not drastically improve the situation, it could help fine-tune some aspects of their work.&#10;&#10;3. Limitations of using a low-pass filter cepstrum: Although there might be some benefits, it is unclear if implementing a low-pass filter cepstrum would significantly address the main issues being faced by the team, such as reducing delays in the silence detector." />
    <node id=" Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Except I don't know because they {disfmarker} I think they are still working well .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh - huh .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and {disfmarker} but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the {disfmarker} the feature computation and so we don't&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK . So Alright so for now at least that 's not there you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum doesn't have a huge effect but it {disfmarker} but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: I th&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh little bit .&#10;Speaker: PhD" />

    <node id="Based on the conversation, there are indications that implementing a silence detector at the server side for the &quot;filt&quot; system is not feasible due to existing delays. These delays do not allow for the integration of a silence detector at the server side. The team has been working on reducing the delay related to the silence detector, but it appears to be a challenging constraint they are facing. They seem to be exploring other possibilities, such as reducing delay on the handset side or finding a compromise between delays on both sides, but these may not have been implemented or tested yet." />

    <node id=" um go through a contextual {disfmarker} uh l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . Um those features go through a contextualized KLT .

Yeah .

    <node id="Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK So uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual but um got tables in front of us . Um what is {disfmarker} what does combo mean ?&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features . And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh {disfmarker} another MLP and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT . Um the output is used as uh features as well .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Um so let me try to restate this and see if I have it right . There is uh {disfmarker} there is the features uh there 's the OGI features and then um those features um go through a contextual {disfmarker} uh l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . Um those features" />
    <node id=" twenty - eight dimensions .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: I see . OK . And what {disfmarker} and what 's OGI forty - five ? The bottom one there ?&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , it 's {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} th it 's the features from the first line&#10;Speaker: PhD D&#10;Content: It 's in fact OGI two .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: S&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: and {disfmarker} yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right , but I mean what 's the {disfmarker} what does the last row mean ?&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: So it 's uh basically this but without the KLT on the {disfmarker} from the left path .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: I thought that was the one {disfmarker} I thought that was the second row . So what 's the difference between the second&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Uh the second line you don't have" />
    <node id=" Yeah .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames {disfmarker} several frames of features&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah .

That 's it .&#10;Speaker: PhD D&#10;Content: Two HTK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK so that 's {disfmarker} that 's this bottom one .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content:" />
    <node id="Content: Um and how does this compare to the numbers {disfmarker} oh so OGI two is just the top {disfmarker} top row ?&#10;Speaker: PhD D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: So yeah to {disfmarker} actually OGI two is the {disfmarker} the baseline with the OGI features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've {disfmarker} they 're still made some changes in the features&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: and {disfmarker} well but uh actually our results are better than their results . Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Uh&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh OK so the one {disfmarker} one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: An&#10;" />
    <node id="The improvement in results comes from the ability to extract more relevant information and capture dependencies between frames when running the neural net transformation in parallel with the features. When run in sequence, each frame is processed independently, which may not fully exploit the relationships between consecutive frames. By processing them in parallel, the model can consider the context of multiple frames simultaneously, leading to improved performance. This was PhD C's suggested approach, and the results indicate that it has been more effective than running the neural net transformation in sequence." />

    <node id="Yes, that's correct. According to Professor B, the change that led to improved and consistent results was running the neural net transformation in parallel with the features, instead of in sequence as initially suggested by PhD C. This approach allows for the exploration of relationships between consecutive frames, which can lead to better performance compared to processing each frame independently." />

    <node id="1. Current status of reducing delay in the silence detector: Based on the conversation, it appears that PhD C and their team are still working on reducing the delay of the silence detector. They had been working on this issue two days prior to the meeting. However, there seems to be a constraint in implementing a silence detector on the server side due to delays.&#10;&#10;The reason for not being able to implement a silence detector at the server side for the filt system is primarily due to existing delays that do not allow for its integration. The team has been working on reducing the delay related to the silence detector, but it appears to be a challenging constraint they are facing. While there may be potential benefits to using a low-pass filter cepstrum, as mentioned by Professor B, it seems unlikely that this would significantly address the main issue of reducing delays in the silence detector.&#10;&#10;At the time of the conversation, PhD C mentions that their team has been working on reducing delay issues for the silence detector within the past two days, but implementing a silence detector at the server side remains unfeasible due to the existing delays. Other possibilities, such as reducing delay on the handset side or finding a compromise between delays on both sides, are being explored but have not been implemented or tested yet." />

    <node id="1. The difference between the second line of content with and without the &quot;combo stuff&quot; refers to the inclusion or exclusion of additional processing steps in the feature extraction pipeline. In this context, the &quot;combo stuff&quot; likely includes the low-pass filtering and the combination of the linear output from two MLPs before applying the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT).&#10;2. Based on the discussion about a delay problem, the relevant lines to consider are those that have been processed while taking the &quot;filt&quot; ones out due to the delay issue. The transcript mentions that the &quot;second line&quot; and the &quot;ones you said I agree are the ones to look at&quot; should be considered, but it is not explicitly clear which lines these refer to.

    <node id="Based on the given transcript, I infer that the &quot;second line of content&quot; refers to a processing pipeline without the additional steps including low-pass filtering and combining linear outputs from two MLPs before applying Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT). The &quot;combo stuff&quot; likely refers to these extra processes.&#10;&#10;The main differences between the second line with and without &quot;combo stuff&quot; are:&#10;1. Additional low-pass filtering of features stream in the &quot;combo&quot; path.&#10;2. Combining linear outputs from two MLPs in the &quot;combo&quot; path.&#10;3. Applying Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) on the combined output in the &quot;combo&quot; path.&#10;&#10;The inclusion of all the output of the &quot;combo&quot; does not seem to affect the selection of lines directly. However, considering the discussion about a delay problem, some specific lines are excluded from the analysis due to filtering constraints. The transcript does not provide enough context for explicit line references; nevertheless, it implies that the focus is on comparing the second line with and without &quot;combo stuff&quot; while taking into account the delay problem's impact on the selection of lines.&#10;&#10;In summary, the differences between processing pipelines with and without &quot;combo stuff&quot; lie in low-pass filtering, combining MLP outputs, and applying KLT, which are not explicitly specified in the provided transcript. The selection of lines to consider is influenced by a delay problem rather than the inclusion of &quot;combo&quot; output." />

    <node id="1. The main topic of discussion between Speakers PhD C and Professor B is related to a neural network system with a focus on channel error resilience. Channel error resilience refers to the system's ability to maintain performance even when there are errors in the communication channels, such as those caused by interference or noise.&#10;&#10;2. The performance of the neural network has been optimized for &quot;seen&quot; databases, which are databases used during the development and tuning phase of the model. However, they mention that it may not perform as well for &quot;unseen&quot; or new databases due to multi-condition tuning, indicating that the system might be overfitted to the seen databases.&#10;&#10;3. Speakers PhD C and Professor B have implemented changes to improve the performance of their neural network system, such as running the neural net transformation in parallel with features and exploring relationships between consecutive frames for better results. They also consider testing a new architecture with a single KLT (Karhunen-Loève Transform) at the end, aiming for lower maintenance while maintaining satisfactory performance.&#10;&#10;4. Professor B briefly touched upon the topic of silence detection in their neural network system and mentioned that they have results related to &quot;word error rates&quot; and the number of sentences recognized by the HTK (Hidden Markov Model Toolkit) system. However, specific values for these metrics were not provided in the transcript.&#10;&#10;5. The speakers discussed a split between seen and unseen databases, where the system has been tuned for better performance on seen databases but may struggle with unseen databases due to the lack of tuning for those conditions. This difference highlights the importance of ensuring that neural network systems can generalize well to new data and not just perform well on the data they have been trained on." />
    <node id="1. The first path, referred to as &quot;KLT,&quot; involves using a Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) with multiple frames of the features.&#10;2. The second path is also an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) that uses several frames of features, similar to the first path but with different processing.&#10;3. The third path, referred to as &quot;combo,&quot; consists of a low-pass filter, another MLP for processing both the original and low-pass filtered features, and a Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) applied to the combined output. This KLT output serves as features for further processing.&#10;&#10;The third path involves more stages than the first two paths, combining the outputs of the first and second proposals with additional processing using a low-pass filter and another MLP." />

    <node id="1. The transcript indicates that a weighting scheme of forty percent (40%) was used for evaluating the TI-digits, while sixty percent (60%) was used for all SpeechDat languages. However, the specifics of how this weighting scheme was applied (whether to percentages or raw errors) is not clarified in the conversation.&#10;2. The mismatch between the testing and training data is handled by categorizing the data into different mismatch levels: well-matched (40% weight), medium mismatch (35% weight), and high mismatch (25% weight). However, the transcript does not provide information on how these categories were determined or applied in the evaluation process.&#10;3. It is important to note that there may have been variations in sentence length within the test sets, with some sentences having as few as one digit and others having up to sixteen digits (including credit card numbers). This variation could potentially affect the weighting scheme and should be taken into account when interpreting the results.&#10;4. Unfortunately, the transcript does not provide specific values for word error rates or the number of sentences recognized by the HTK system, so a more detailed analysis cannot be performed." />

However, the speakers do agree that there is a deadline on Wednesday, with potential concerns about time zone differences.&#10;&#10;When clarifying the deadline, PhD D mentions that &quot;three PM here is in Europe midnight,&quot; to which Professor B responds by saying, &quot;three PM . . . six in the morning here.&quot; This implies that the speakers are considering three PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) as their deadline, which would be six in the morning on January 31st in Central European Time (CET).&#10;&#10;Given this information, the speakers should aim to complete the task by the morning of Wednesday, January 31st, CET.

Current status of reducing delay in the silence detector: Based on the conversation, it appears that PhD C and their team are still working on reducing the delay of the silence detector. They had been working on this issue two days prior to the meeting. However, there seems to be a constraint in implementing a silence detector on the server side due to delays.&#10;&#10;The reason for not being able to implement a silence detector at the server side for the filt system is primarily due to existing delays that do not allow for its integration. The team has been working on reducing the delay related to the silence detector, but it appears to be a challenging constraint they are facing. While there may be potential benefits to using a low-pass filter cepstrum, as mentioned by Professor B, it seems unlikely that this would significantly address the main issue of reducing delays in the silence detector.&#10;&#10;At the time of the conversation, PhD C mentions that their team has been working on reducing delay issues for the silence detector within the past two days, but implementing a silence detector at the server side remains unfeasible due to the existing delays. Other possibilities, such as reducing delay on the handset side or finding a compromise between delays on both sides, are being explored but have not been implemented or tested yet.">

Current status of reducing delay in the silence detector: Based on the conversation, it appears that PhD C and their team are still working on reducing the delay of the silence detector. They had been working on this issue two days prior to the meeting. However, there seems to be a constraint in implementing a silence detector on the server side due to delays.&#10;&#10;The reason for not being able to implement a silence detector at the server side for the filt system is primarily due to existing delays that do not allow for its integration. The team has been working on reducing the delay related to the silence detector, but it appears to be a challenging constraint they are facing. While there may be potential benefits to using a low-pass filter cepstrum, as mentioned by Professor B, it seems unlikely that this would significantly address the main issue of reducing delays in the silence detector.&#10;&#10;At the time of the conversation, PhD C mentions that their team has been working on reducing delay issues for the silence detector within the past two days, but implementing a silence detector at the server side remains unfeasible due to the existing delays. Other possibilities, such as reducing delay on the handset side or finding a compromise between delays on both sides, are being explored but have not been implemented or tested yet.">

    <edge source="1. Current status of reducing delay in the silence detector: Based on the conversation, it appears that PhD C and their team are still working on reducing the delay of the silence detector. They had been working on this issue two days prior to the meeting. However, there seems to be a constraint in implementing a silence detector on the server side due to delays.&#10;&#10;The reason for not being able to implement a silence detector at the server side for the filt system is primarily due to existing delays that do not allow for its integration. The team has been working on reducing the delay related to the silence detector, but it appears to be a challenging constraint they are facing. While there may be potential benefits to using a low-pass filter cepstrum, as mentioned by Professor B, it seems unlikely that this would significantly address the main issue of reducing delays in the silence detector.&#10;&#10;At the time of the conversation, PhD C mentions that their team has been working on reducing delay issues for the silence detector within the past two days, but implementing a silence detector at the server side remains unfeasible due to the existing delays. Other possibilities, such as reducing delay on the handset side or finding a compromise between delays on both sides, are being explored but have not been implemented or tested yet." target="Based on the conversation, the primary tasks for the team next Thursday, after the fixing of the system, will include:&#10;&#10;1. Processing new data from Germany and Denmark by taking whatever is available and running it through the fixed system. This process won't involve any new training but rather new HTK runs.&#10;2. Working with partners to fill out tables in the days leading up to Wednesday (the 31st), as mentioned by PhD C. There seems to be a need to finalize these tables by a specific hour in European time on that day, and there might be some concerns about potential differences in time zones or valid workdays between regions.&#10;&#10;The exact details of the tasks may depend on further information not provided in the transcript, but the primary focus will be on processing the new data from Germany and Denmark using the fixed system and collaborating with partners on completing tables for submission.">

The transcript does not provide enough context for explicit line references; nevertheless, it implies that the focus is on comparing the second line with and without &quot;combo stuff&quot; while taking into account the delay problem's impact on the selection of lines.&#10;&#10;In summary, the differences between processing pipelines with and without &quot;combo stuff&quot; lie in low-pass filtering, combining MLP outputs, and applying KLT, which are not explicitly specified in the provided transcript.

The conversation continues with other topics, and there is no further context given about any new details regarding the architectures. Therefore, I'm unable to answer this question without more context or information." target="1. The main topic of discussion between Speakers PhD C and Professor B is related to a neural network system with a focus on channel error resilience. Channel error resilience refers to the system's ability to maintain performance even when there are errors in the communication channels, such as those caused by interference or noise.&#10;&#10;2. The performance of the neural network has been optimized for &quot;seen&quot; databases, which are databases used during the development and tuning phase of the model. However, they mention that it may not perform as well for &quot;unseen&quot; or new databases due to multi-condition tuning, indicating that the system might be overfitted to the seen databases.&#10;&#10;3. Speakers PhD C and Professor B have implemented changes to improve the performance of their neural network system, such as running the neural net transformation in parallel with features and exploring relationships between consecutive frames for better results. They also consider testing a new architecture with a single KLT (Karhunen-Loève Transform) at the end, aiming for lower maintenance while maintaining satisfactory performance.&#10;&#10;4. Professor B briefly touched upon the topic of silence detection in their neural network system and mentioned that they have results related to &quot;word error rates&quot; and the number of sentences recognized by the HTK (Hidden Markov Model Toolkit) system. However, specific values for these metrics were not provided in the transcript.&#10;&#10;5. The speakers discussed a split between seen and unseen databases, where the system has been tuned for better performance on seen databases but may struggle with unseen databases due to the lack of tuning for those conditions. This difference highlights the importance of ensuring that neural network systems can generalize well to new data and not just perform well on the data they have been trained on.">

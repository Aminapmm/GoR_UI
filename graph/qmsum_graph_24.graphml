    <node id=": Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: OK ? And um {disfmarker} And then after three tasks the system breaks down . And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator .

I mean {pause} you know , if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff , then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic {disfmarker} more interesting linguistic stuff .

    <node id=" looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from {disfmarker} sort of as general as argument structure constructions . Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . I have to do uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} unbounded dependencies , you know , which have a variety of constructions in {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} instantiate that .

    <node id="1. Build a prototype that handles activities in a hierarchical fashion: This means creating a system where high-level activities are broken down into smaller, more specific tasks. For example, the overarching goal of &quot;going to a place&quot; could have sub-options like &quot;symphony,&quot; &quot;opera,&quot; &quot;tourist site guide,&quot; or &quot;nightclub/disco.&quot;&#10;2. Evaluate the prototype by trying it out with various scenarios: Instead of deciding on a single scenario, consider exploring two different ones, such as planning and giving instructions on the spot. This will help ensure that the system can handle multiple types of situations.&#10;3. Consider the linguistic aspect: Decide what aspects of language are important for your system to recognize and build those features into the prototype. Determine whether you want a simple response system or if more complex linguistic structures should be allowed.&#10;4. Collect speech data through conversations about specific places (e.g., &quot;visiting the zoo tomorrow&quot;) to train the prototype on different ways users might phrase their requests.&#10;5. As for evaluating success, gather rich, complex data during testing and ensure that your system can handle various linguistic structures. Additionally, monitor if the system accurately handles hierarchical activities as per the designed scenarios." />
    <node id=" uh build a prototype , uh probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway . So , Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah , the this was sort of {disfmarker} these are all different sort of activities . Um But I think y I {disfmarker} I got the point and I think I like it . We can do {disfmarker} put them in a more hierarchical fashion . So , &quot; Go to place &quot; and then give them a choice , you know either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say &quot; yeah this is {disfmarker} on that &quot; go to big - ish place &quot; ,&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: this is what I would do . &quot; And then we have the &quot; Fix &quot; thing , and then maybe &quot; Do something the other day &quot; thing , so . My question is {disfmarker} I guess , to some extent , we should {disfmarker} y we just have to try it out and see if" />
    <node id=": So we would rather just ask {disfmarker} uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo , uh and assume that that will {disfmarker} that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Bigger {disfmarker} Y yeah thi well this is a question for {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: And that way you get the speech data of people saying &quot; zoo &quot; over and over again or whatever too .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Yeah . So this is a question for you ,&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: and , you know , if we {disfmarker} if we do , and we probably will , actually try to uh build a prototype , uh probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway . So , Um {disfmarker}&#10;" />
    <node id=" build in explicitly into our data collection ? &quot; So {disfmarker} Um , one could {disfmarker} sort of {disfmarker} think of {disfmarker} you know we could call the z see or {disfmarker} you know , people who visit the zoo we could s call it &quot; Visit the zoo tomorrow &quot; , so we have an intention of seeing something , but not now {disfmarker} but later .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Right . Yeah . Yeah , so {disfmarker} let 's s uh s see I th I think that from one point of view , Uh , um , all these places are the same , so that d d That , um {disfmarker} in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , so I th i it seems to me that We ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us . And um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . Um are all big - ish things that um {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} have different parts to" />
    <node id=" to {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: I think so .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this {pause} side . Commented and {disfmarker} what they 're about and sort of {disfmarker} the properties we may um give them . And here are the uh {disfmarker} tasks to be implemented via our data collection . So all of these tasks {disfmarker} The reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other . And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um {disfmarker} intention . And these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . Analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and {pause} that may or may not be a problem . We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that" />

    <node id="&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: And what w what happened is that um design - wise I 'd sort of n noticed that we can {disfmarker} we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go - there User Go - there Situation nodes . So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user . How much will he {disfmarker} is he willing to spend ? Or can spend .

Twenty - two million to fly to International Space Station , you know . just {disfmarker} Not all people can do that .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: So , and this actually turned out to be pretty key ," />

    <node id="1. The speakers are discussing the trade-off between building a system with redundant data and creating a system that covers a wide range of possibilities, keeping in mind the potential boredom of individuals who may have to provide similar data multiple times.&#10;2. Professor D mentions that building a system with the most data on a relatively confined set of things is useful for certain applications (like speech), but having everyone say exactly the same thing isn't interesting. This suggests they prefer some level of diversity in user inputs.&#10;3. The speakers seem to agree that there should be a balance between gathering rich, complex data and ensuring that the system can handle various linguistic structures without overburdening users with repetitive tasks.&#10;4. Grad C likes the idea of demonstrating the system's inferencing capabilities with ideal speaker utterances, suggesting they value showcasing the system's strengths in addition to handling diverse inputs.&#10;5.

    <node id="1. The speakers are discussing the trade-off between building a system with redundant data and creating a system that covers a wide range of possibilities, keeping in mind the potential boredom of individuals who may have to provide similar data multiple times. This is related to the discussion about whether it's more effective to carefully plan and schedule a complex task or to give the impression of only six simple steps that can be completed in two days.&#10;&#10;Professor D mentions that building a system with the most data on a relatively confined set of things is useful for certain applications (like speech), but having everyone say exactly the same thing isn't interesting. This suggests they prefer some level of diversity in user inputs, which could include both carefully planned and spontaneous responses.&#10;&#10;Grad C likes the idea of demonstrating the system's inferencing capabilities with ideal speaker utterances, suggesting they value showcasing the system's strengths in addition to handling diverse inputs. This also supports the notion that the speakers are considering both planning and spontaneity when designing the system.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speakers believe in striking a balance between collecting redundant data and covering a wide range of possibilities while being mindful of potential user boredom. They aim to create a system that can handle various linguistic structures and different types of scenarios (planning and giving instructions on the spot), further emphasizing their interest in balancing scheduled and spontaneous responses." />

    <node id="1. The speakers are discussing the robustness and popularity of a parser in the context of building a system that can handle various linguistic structures. They mention an existing parser, which they believe is robust but not popular or widely used.&#10;2. Grad B suggests setting up infrastructure and eliciting particular constructions from a subset of the group to better understand what kind of data they need to collect for their research. This involves communicating with the group about specific linguistic constructions that are of interest.&#10;3. Professor D clarifies that their focus is on semantic constructions, rather than syntactic ones. They want to ensure that the system can handle a wide range of possible user inputs, which requires collecting diverse data and designing a parser that can infer meaning from different linguistic structures.&#10;4. The discussion about the parser's robustness and popularity is closely tied to their goal of building a prototype that can handle hierarchical activities and various linguistic structures. They acknowledge that while the existing parser may be robust, its limited popularity suggests that there is room for improvement in terms of handling different kinds of user inputs.&#10;5. By communicating with the group about specific constructions, they aim to collect rich, complex data that can help them build a more versatile and popular parser, all while being mindful of potential user boredom from providing redundant data." />

The fictional computer system, referred to as &quot;Fey,&quot; has the capability to understand and respond to user queries by converting text inputs into spoken words through speech synthesis. This is demonstrated when a user asks &quot;How do I get to the castle?&quot;, and the system produces a response such as &quot;In order to get to the castle you do...&quot; after a few seconds.&#10;2. However, this system has a limitation in that it breaks down after completing three tasks, which suggests that its functionality is not robust enough for extended use or handling complex tasks beyond a certain point. This could be due to various reasons such as insufficient data processing capabilities or limitations in the underlying algorithms used for natural language understanding and speech synthesis. Nonetheless, the system's ability to understand and respond to user inputs with spoken words makes it valuable for applications where speech output is desirable." />

    <node id="1. Thesis Focus and Fit: Professor D mentions a need for a separate conversation with Grad B about their &quot;thesis fantasies&quot; and how the topic of causal motion in German tourist data fits into that. This implies that there are specific aspects of Grad B's thesis research, such as the scope, methodology, or theoretical framework, which require further discussion and alignment with the broader goals of the project on semantic constructions and caused motion.&#10;2. Data Collection: As part of this conversation, they will likely discuss how to collect data that supports Grad B's thesis while also serving the needs of the overall project. This may include selecting appropriate linguistic constructions, determining research questions, setting up infrastructure for eliciting or gathering data, and deciding on a suitable level of granularity in their analysis.&#10;3. Semantic Construction Analysis: Since Professor D has specifically mentioned semantic constructions, it is possible that they will focus on the meaning and interpretation of various linguistic elements in German tourist data, particularly those related to causal motion. This could involve examining the relationships between different verbs, nouns, and adverbs, as well as how these components interact with one another in sentences or larger discourse structures.&#10;4. Methodological Alignment: The conversation may also touch on the alignment of methodologies used by Grad B and Professor D to ensure that their research complements each other effectively. This might include discussing statistical methods, corpus linguistic tools, computational modeling techniques, or theoretical frameworks for interpreting data.&#10;5. Expectation Management: In this context, &quot;thesis fantasies&quot; may also refer to managing expectations regarding the potential outcomes and contributions of Grad B's research. This could involve discussions around publication plans, conference presentations, or grant applications, as well as setting realistic goals for the scope and impact of Grad B's thesis." />

    <node id="Based on the conversation transcript, it seems that while a significant portion of Heidelberg's tourist attractions can be accessed by public transportation, there are certain limitations. Professor D mentions that the Philosophers' Way is not easily accessible by public transport, and there might be hiking destinations that also cannot be reached conveniently. Nonetheless, most other tourist-oriented places should be reachable using public transportation options." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, a tour, as referred to by Professor D, typically occurs within a single day. This is evident when Grad F asked, &quot;So all tours happen only within one day?&quot; and Professor D responded with &quot;Yes.&quot; Furthermore, when discussing decision nodes and differentiating between activities that can be done now, later on the same tour, or on the next tour, it seems that the &quot;next tour&quot; implies the following day. However, Grad C mentioned their experience in Prague where they never went back to the hotel for several nights, which could suggest the possibility of multi-day tours. Nonetheless, based on the information provided in the transcript, a tour usually takes place within a single day and occurs on consecutive days." />
    <node id=" So the next tour will be tomorrow ?&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Right . For this .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: OK . Just to be totally clear .

    <node id="1. Based on the transcript, the proposed plan for scheduling ten people is to be determined by Undergrad E, who has offered to schedule them. However, the specific timeline for this task is not explicitly stated in the text provided. The group then decides to have a review of their work so far planned for the next Monday. To summarize, while there is a proposed action (scheduling ten people) and an agreed-upon deadline (the next Monday) for the review of their work, the exact time frame for completing the task of scheduling those individuals is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript excerpt.&#10;2. In order to provide a more precise answer, it would be helpful to have additional context or information from the surrounding parts of the meeting transcript. This might include discussions about deadlines, schedules, or time frames that could help clarify when they plan to schedule these ten individuals and complete any related tasks. Without this context, however, we can only infer that scheduling should be completed before the next Monday's review based on general project management principles but not from the given excerpt itself." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the person that the tour could be for could potentially be either a tourist or a business person. This is suggested when Grad B and C discuss the possibility of it being a &quot;tourist&quot; or someone who is using the system for &quot;business&quot; purposes. The example given by Grad B about her father going to Prague for both teaching at a business school and touring around further supports this notion, as he can be considered both a tourist and a business person. Therefore, the tour could cater to the needs of either type of individual, depending on their specific requirements." />
    <node id=" . He sort of had it in there . &quot; Who is the {disfmarker} the tour is the person ? &quot; So it might be a tourist ,&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: it might be a business man who 's using the system , who wants to sort of go to some {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Yeah , or {disfmarker} or both .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Yeah .

He is going to uh {disfmarker} He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around and so he may have some mixture of these things .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="1. The speakers are contemplating how much detail to include in their data collection process regarding a person's intent when interacting with objects or places. This includes determining whether someone intends to enter, view, or approach an object. They are considering building explicit constructions for these intentions into their data collection but have not yet reached a consensus.&#10;&#10;To address this question, the group should consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;a) Define specific scenarios and user intentions: Clearly outline different situations where users might interact with objects or places, such as visiting a museum exhibit or attending a concert. This will help define the range of user intentions that need to be accounted for in the data collection process.&#10;&#10;b) Weigh potential benefits against complexity: Explicitly capturing detailed user intentions can provide valuable insights into human-object interactions but may also increase data complexity and reduce user engagement if users are required to repeatedly input similar information. The group should find a balance between gathering rich, nuanced data and maintaining user interest.&#10;&#10;c) Design the data collection process with flexibility in mind: Allow for some level of customization or expansion within the system so that it can evolve as new user intentions or scenarios emerge. This will help ensure that the data collection process remains relevant and adaptable over time.&#10;&#10;d) Consult existing research on related topics: Investigate how other studies or systems have approached similar challenges in capturing user intentions and learn from their successes and limitations. This can inform the group's decision-making process and help them identify best practices for their project." />
    <node id="1. The speakers are discussing the trade-off between building a system with redundant data and creating a system that covers a wide range of possibilities, keeping in mind the potential boredom of individuals who may have to provide similar data multiple times. The point of building a system with redundant data is to ensure that the system can handle various situations and linguistic structures by gathering rich, diverse inputs from users. However, they are aware that excessive repetition might lead to user boredom or frustration. On the other hand, specializing in a specific area with more data allows for better performance in certain applications like speech recognition, but it may not be as interesting for users since everyone would be saying the same thing. The speakers aim to find a balance between these two approaches.&#10;&#10;2. Professor D suggests simplifying the data collection process by limiting variation in their ontology or types of places. While this approach could make the data easier to handle, there is a risk of missing valuable information about how people talk about specific places, like museums versus universities. The speakers are considering this option but have not yet reached a consensus, as they recognize both its potential benefits and drawbacks. By limiting variation, they can reduce redundancy in the data collection process, making it less boring for users. However, this might result in losing valuable information about how people talk about specific things." />
    <node id="1. The two different scenarios being discussed are:&#10;   A. A planner scenario, where the system helps users plan activities in a hierarchical fashion (e.g., breaking down the overarching goal of &quot;going to a place&quot; into smaller tasks like &quot;symphony,&quot; &quot;opera,&quot; &quot;tourist site guide,&quot; or &quot;nightclub/disco&quot;).&#10;   B. An on-the-spot instruction scenario, where the system provides instructions immediately without prior planning.&#10;&#10;2. The scenario involving the system masquerading as a simple response system is the on-the-spot instruction scenario. In this case, the speakers focus on how people phrase planning requests, as they want to handle various linguistic structures and different types of scenarios (planning and giving instructions on the spot). This will help ensure that the system can manage multiple types of situations while being mindful of potential user boredom from providing similar data repeatedly." />
    <node id="1. The speakers discuss approaching a complex subject, such as building a prototype that can handle hierarchical activities and various linguistic structures, by focusing on understanding how users phrase planning requests and exploring different linguistic structures (as expressed by Grad C's interest). They aim to find a balance between gathering rich, complex data and ensuring the system can handle these diverse inputs without causing user boredom or frustration from excessive repetition.&#10;   &#10;2. The group also suggests evaluating the system's inferencing capabilities by thinking of two or three ideal speaker utterances that follow each other in a conversation. This approach showcases how the system handles different parts of a conversation and its ability to make coherent inferences based on user inputs.&#10;&#10;3. To further analyze the items discussed, it can be inferred from the context that the group intends to do a preliminary assessment of many items and then limit the number to around ten for deeper examination over the summer. This plan allows them to focus on specific aspects of the complex subject while maintaining an adequate level of detail and coverage." />
    <node id="1. The question you provided is asking about the group's thoughts on whether their current chart with all the decisions will cover their needs or if they should consider additional options. Based on the transcript excerpt, there is no direct conversation regarding this specific question. However, we can infer that Professor D might be raising a similar concern when saying &quot;Do people think that, you know, this is gonna um cover what we need, or should we be thinking about more?&quot; but they were not discussing the chart specifically in this part of the conversation. To provide an accurate answer, more context or information from the meeting transcript would be needed." />

The fictional computer system, referred to as &quot;Fey,&quot; has the capability to understand and respond to user queries by converting text inputs into spoken words through speech synthesis. This is demonstrated when a user asks &quot;How do I get to the castle?&quot;, and the system produces a response such as &quot;In order to get to the castle you do...&quot; after a few seconds.&#10;2. However, this system has a limitation in that it breaks down after completing three tasks, which suggests that its functionality is not robust enough for extended use or handling complex tasks beyond a certain point. This could be due to various reasons such as insufficient data processing capabilities or limitations in the underlying algorithms used for natural language understanding and speech synthesis. Nonetheless, the system's ability to understand and respond to user inputs with spoken words makes it valuable for applications where speech output is desirable.">

This suggests they prefer some level of diversity in user inputs, which could include both carefully planned and spontaneous responses.&#10;&#10;Grad C likes the idea of demonstrating the system's inferencing capabilities with ideal speaker utterances, suggesting they value showcasing the system's strengths in addition to handling diverse inputs.

The speakers are discussing the trade-off between building a system with redundant data and creating a system that covers a wide range of possibilities, keeping in mind the potential boredom of individuals who may have to provide similar data multiple times. The point of building a system with redundant data is to ensure that the system can handle various situations and linguistic structures by gathering rich, diverse inputs from users. However, they are aware that excessive repetition might lead to user boredom or frustration. On the other hand, specializing in a specific area with more data allows for better performance in certain applications like speech recognition, but it may not be as interesting for users since everyone would be saying the same thing. The speakers aim to find a balance between these two approaches.&#10;&#10;2. Professor D suggests simplifying the data collection process by limiting variation in their ontology or types of places. While this approach could make the data easier to handle, there is a risk of missing valuable information about how people talk about specific places, like museums versus universities. The speakers are considering this option but have not yet reached a consensus, as they recognize both its potential benefits and drawbacks. By limiting variation, they can reduce redundancy in the data collection process, making it less boring for users. However, this might result in losing valuable information about how people talk about specific things.">

The speakers are contemplating how much detail to include in their data collection process regarding a person's intent when interacting with objects or places. This includes determining whether someone intends to enter, view, or approach an object. They are considering building explicit constructions for these intentions into their data collection but have not yet reached a consensus.&#10;&#10;To address this question, the group should consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;a) Define specific scenarios and user intentions: Clearly outline different situations where users might interact with objects or places, such as visiting a museum exhibit or attending a concert. This will help define the range of user intentions that need to be accounted for in the data collection process.&#10;&#10;b) Weigh potential benefits against complexity: Explicitly capturing detailed user intentions can provide valuable insights into human-object interactions but may also increase data complexity and reduce user engagement if users are required to repeatedly input similar information. The group should find a balance between gathering rich, nuanced data and maintaining user interest.&#10;&#10;c) Design the data collection process with flexibility in mind: Allow for some level of customization or expansion within the system so that it can evolve as new user intentions or scenarios emerge. This will help ensure that the data collection process remains relevant and adaptable over time.&#10;&#10;d) Consult existing research on related topics: Investigate how other studies or systems have approached similar challenges in capturing user intentions and learn from their successes and limitations. This can inform the group's decision-making process and help them identify best practices for their project.">

This is demonstrated when a user asks &quot;How do I get to the castle?&quot;, and the system produces a response such as &quot;In order to get to the castle you do...&quot; after a few seconds.&#10;2. However, this system has a limitation in that it breaks down after completing three tasks, which suggests that its functionality is not robust enough for extended use or handling complex tasks beyond a certain point. This could be due to various reasons such as insufficient data processing capabilities or limitations in the underlying algorithms used for natural language understanding and speech synthesis. Nonetheless, the system's ability to understand and respond to user inputs with spoken words makes it valuable for applications where speech output is desirable.">

The fictional computer system, referred to as &quot;Fey,&quot; has the capability to understand and respond to user queries by converting text inputs into spoken words through speech synthesis. This is demonstrated when a user asks &quot;How do I get to the castle?&quot;, and the system produces a response such as &quot;In order to get to the castle you do...&quot; after a few seconds.&#10;2. However, this system has a limitation in that it breaks down after completing three tasks, which suggests that its functionality is not robust enough for extended use or handling complex tasks beyond a certain point. This could be due to various reasons such as insufficient data processing capabilities or limitations in the underlying algorithms used for natural language understanding and speech synthesis. Nonetheless, the system's ability to understand and respond to user inputs with spoken words makes it valuable for applications where speech output is desirable.">

The speakers are discussing the trade-off between building a system with redundant data and creating a system that covers a wide range of possibilities, keeping in mind the potential boredom of individuals who may have to provide similar data multiple times. The point of building a system with redundant data is to ensure that the system can handle various situations and linguistic structures by gathering rich, diverse inputs from users. However, they are aware that excessive repetition might lead to user boredom or frustration. On the other hand, specializing in a specific area with more data allows for better performance in certain applications like speech recognition, but it may not be as interesting for users since everyone would be saying the same thing. The speakers aim to find a balance between these two approaches.&#10;&#10;2. Professor D suggests simplifying the data collection process by limiting variation in their ontology or types of places. While this approach could make the data easier to handle, there is a risk of missing valuable information about how people talk about specific places, like museums versus universities. The speakers are considering this option but have not yet reached a consensus, as they recognize both its potential benefits and drawbacks. By limiting variation, they can reduce redundancy in the data collection process, making it less boring for users.

They are considering building explicit constructions for these intentions into their data collection but have not yet reached a consensus.&#10;&#10;To address this question, the group should consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;a) Define specific scenarios and user intentions: Clearly outline different situations where users might interact with objects or places, such as visiting a museum exhibit or attending a concert. This will help define the range of user intentions that need to be accounted for in the data collection process.&#10;&#10;b) Weigh potential benefits against complexity: Explicitly capturing detailed user intentions can provide valuable insights into human-object interactions but may also increase data complexity and reduce user engagement if users are required to repeatedly input similar information.

This will help ensure that the data collection process remains relevant and adaptable over time.&#10;&#10;d) Consult existing research on related topics: Investigate how other studies or systems have approached similar challenges in capturing user intentions and learn from their successes and limitations.

Data Collection: As part of this conversation, they will likely discuss how to collect data that supports Grad B's thesis while also serving the needs of the overall project. This may include selecting appropriate linguistic constructions, determining research questions, setting up infrastructure for eliciting or gathering data, and deciding on a suitable level of granularity in their analysis.&#10;3. Semantic Construction Analysis: Since Professor D has specifically mentioned semantic constructions, it is possible that they will focus on the meaning and interpretation of various linguistic elements in German tourist data, particularly those related to causal motion. This could involve examining the relationships between different verbs, nouns, and adverbs, as well as how these components interact with one another in sentences or larger discourse structures.&#10;4. Methodological Alignment: The conversation may also touch on the alignment of methodologies used by Grad B and Professor D to ensure that their research complements each other effectively.

The speakers are contemplating how much detail to include in their data collection process regarding a person's intent when interacting with objects or places. This includes determining whether someone intends to enter, view, or approach an object. They are considering building explicit constructions for these intentions into their data collection but have not yet reached a consensus.&#10;&#10;To address this question, the group should consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;a) Define specific scenarios and user intentions: Clearly outline different situations where users might interact with objects or places, such as visiting a museum exhibit or attending a concert. This will help define the range of user intentions that need to be accounted for in the data collection process.&#10;&#10;b) Weigh potential benefits against complexity: Explicitly capturing detailed user intentions can provide valuable insights into human-object interactions but may also increase data complexity and reduce user engagement if users are required to repeatedly input similar information. The group should find a balance between gathering rich, nuanced data and maintaining user interest.&#10;&#10;c) Design the data collection process with flexibility in mind: Allow for some level of customization or expansion within the system so that it can evolve as new user intentions or scenarios emerge. This will help ensure that the data collection process remains relevant and adaptable over time.&#10;&#10;d) Consult existing research on related topics: Investigate how other studies or systems have approached similar challenges in capturing user intentions and learn from their successes and limitations.

The speakers are contemplating how much detail to include in their data collection process regarding a person's intent when interacting with objects or places. This includes determining whether someone intends to enter, view, or approach an object. They are considering building explicit constructions for these intentions into their data collection but have not yet reached a consensus.&#10;&#10;To address this question, the group should consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;a) Define specific scenarios and user intentions: Clearly outline different situations where users might interact with objects or places, such as visiting a museum exhibit or attending a concert. This will help define the range of user intentions that need to be accounted for in the data collection process.&#10;&#10;b) Weigh potential benefits against complexity: Explicitly capturing detailed user intentions can provide valuable insights into human-object interactions but may also increase data complexity and reduce user engagement if users are required to repeatedly input similar information. The group should find a balance between gathering rich, nuanced data and maintaining user interest.&#10;&#10;c) Design the data collection process with flexibility in mind: Allow for some level of customization or expansion within the system so that it can evolve as new user intentions or scenarios emerge. This will help ensure that the data collection process remains relevant and adaptable over time.&#10;&#10;d) Consult existing research on related topics: Investigate how other studies or systems have approached similar challenges in capturing user intentions and learn from their successes and limitations. This can inform the group's decision-making process and help them identify best practices for their project.">

The speakers are contemplating how much detail to include in their data collection process regarding a person's intent when interacting with objects or places. This includes determining whether someone intends to enter, view, or approach an object. They are considering building explicit constructions for these intentions into their data collection but have not yet reached a consensus.&#10;&#10;To address this question, the group should consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;a) Define specific scenarios and user intentions: Clearly outline different situations where users might interact with objects or places, such as visiting a museum exhibit or attending a concert. This will help define the range of user intentions that need to be accounted for in the data collection process.&#10;&#10;b) Weigh potential benefits against complexity: Explicitly capturing detailed user intentions can provide valuable insights into human-object interactions but may also increase data complexity and reduce user engagement if users are required to repeatedly input similar information. The group should find a balance between gathering rich, nuanced data and maintaining user interest.&#10;&#10;c) Design the data collection process with flexibility in mind: Allow for some level of customization or expansion within the system so that it can evolve as new user intentions or scenarios emerge. This will help ensure that the data collection process remains relevant and adaptable over time.&#10;&#10;d) Consult existing research on related topics: Investigate how other studies or systems have approached similar challenges in capturing user intentions and learn from their successes and limitations. This can inform the group's decision-making process and help them identify best practices for their project.">

In order to provide a more precise answer, it would be helpful to have additional context or information from the surrounding parts of the meeting transcript. This might include discussions about deadlines, schedules, or time frames that could help clarify when they plan to schedule these ten individuals and complete any related tasks. Without this context, however, we can only infer that scheduling should be completed before the next Monday's review based on general project management principles but not from the given excerpt itself." target="1. The question you provided is asking about the group's thoughts on whether their current chart with all the decisions will cover their needs or if they should consider additional options. Based on the transcript excerpt, there is no direct conversation regarding this specific question. However, we can infer that Professor D might be raising a similar concern when saying &quot;Do people think that, you know, this is gonna um cover what we need, or should we be thinking about more?&quot; but they were not discussing the chart specifically in this part of the conversation. To provide an accurate answer, more context or information from the meeting transcript would be needed.">

    <edge source="Based on the transcript provided, the person that the tour could be for could potentially be either a tourist or a business person. This is suggested when Grad B and C discuss the possibility of it being a &quot;tourist&quot; or someone who is using the system for &quot;business&quot; purposes. The example given by Grad B about her father going to Prague for both teaching at a business school and touring around further supports this notion, as he can be considered both a tourist and a business person. Therefore, the tour could cater to the needs of either type of individual, depending on their specific requirements." target=" .

Yeah , I mean like for example my {disfmarker} my father is about to travel to Prague .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: He 'll be there for two weeks . He is going to uh {disfmarker} He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around and so he may have some mixture of these things .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker">

    <edge source="1. The speakers discuss approaching a complex subject, such as building a prototype that can handle hierarchical activities and various linguistic structures, by focusing on understanding how users phrase planning requests and exploring different linguistic structures (as expressed by Grad C's interest). They aim to find a balance between gathering rich, complex data and ensuring the system can handle these diverse inputs without causing user boredom or frustration from excessive repetition.&#10;   &#10;2. The group also suggests evaluating the system's inferencing capabilities by thinking of two or three ideal speaker utterances that follow each other in a conversation. This approach showcases how the system handles different parts of a conversation and its ability to make coherent inferences based on user inputs.&#10;&#10;3. To further analyze the items discussed, it can be inferred from the context that the group intends to do a preliminary assessment of many items and then limit the number to around ten for deeper examination over the summer. This plan allows them to focus on specific aspects of the complex subject while maintaining an adequate level of detail and coverage." target="1.

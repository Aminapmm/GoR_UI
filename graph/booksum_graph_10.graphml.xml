<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" The patient, who has been referred to as &quot;my patient&quot; and &quot;Renfield&quot; throughout the narrative, attacked the speaker, who is a doctor, because he was a danger to the doctor and tried to keep the table between them. The patient had a dinner-knife in his hand and struck at the doctor, cutting his left wrist. The patient then proceeded to lick the blood off the floor &quot;like a dog&quot; because he was probably driven by a strong and irresistible urge, possibly due to his mental illness and the delusional beliefs that he holds. The narrative mentions that the patient had a &quot;face distorted with passion&quot; and was &quot;employment positively sickened&quot; the attendants who saw him licking the blood off the floor. This behavior is consistent with the patient's previous actions and delusions, as he has been collecting and consuming live insects and spiders in the belief that it will give him strength. The attack on the doctor and the licking of the blood off the floor is an escalation of the patient's previous behavior and may be a result of his increasingly deranged state of mind."/>
<node id=", and in&#10;rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was&#10;thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord&#10;into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's&#10;pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,&#10;as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was&#10;too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my&#10;balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.&#10;Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was&#10;sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a&#10;little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not&#10;intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,&#10;keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the&#10;attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment&#10;positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking&#10;up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was"/>
<node id="&#10;&#10;We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen&#10;window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and&#10;handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I&#10;attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then&#10;with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and&#10;opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There&#10;was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at&#10;hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,&#10;dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four&#10;servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,&#10;for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the&#10;room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at&#10;each other, and as we moved away he said: &quot;We can attend to them later.&quot;&#10;Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the&#10;door to listen, but there was no sound"/>
<node id=" said as we descended the&#10;stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he&#10;closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but&#10;the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of&#10;death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly&#10;observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light&#10;enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved&#10;by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about&#10;something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--&#10;&#10;&quot;What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have&#10;another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life&#10;won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am&#10;exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have&#10;courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his&#10;veins for her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter with me, anyhow?&quot;&#10;&#10;The voice came from the sofa across"/>
<node id=" all away&#10;and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be&#10;pleased with her, I am sure.&quot;&#10;&#10;She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As&#10;she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen&#10;grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady&#10;was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;&#10;he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into&#10;her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and&#10;forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.&#10;&#10;Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He&#10;raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat&#10;his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,&#10;and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs&#10;that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised&#10;his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe."/>
<node id=" men&#10;made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to&#10;which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at&#10;our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was&#10;myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and&#10;saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of&#10;Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called&#10;him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a&#10;decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to &quot;shut up for a&#10;foul-mouthed beggar,&quot; whereon our man accused him of robbing him and&#10;wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to&#10;swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,&#10;so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his&#10;mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless&#10;yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I"/>
<node id=" was fond of go to grass&#10;all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at&#10;her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there&#10;wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a&#10;bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without&#10;betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?&quot; As he spoke&#10;the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense&#10;regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible&#10;mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very&#10;heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a&#10;royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before&#10;answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the&#10;Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed&#10;so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered&#10;in the same phrase: &quot;That's so.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how long has this been going on?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About ten"/>
<node id=" The recent changes in Jonathan's life signify a number of significant developments and transitions. His marriage to Mina indicates the beginning of a new phase in his personal life, as they settle into their new home and start their life together. His prosperity, including becoming a partner in his law firm and gaining financial stability, reflects his professional growth and success. However, his recent illness could be a manifestation of the stress and strain brought about by these changes, as well as the grief of losing Mr. Hawkins, who had been a mentor and father figure to him. The illness may also serve as a reminder of his previous affliction in Whitby, suggesting a potential connection or underlying condition that continues to affect his health. Overall, these changes represent both the positive developments in Jonathan's life and the challenges that come with them."/>
<node id=" to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.&#10;&#10;It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much&#10;between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and&#10;no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a&#10;partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and&#10;Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me&#10;about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what&#10;unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up&#10;again with an exercise anyhow....&#10;&#10;The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves&#10;and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his&#10;London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the&#10;President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in&#10;hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....&#10;&#10;We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.&#10;Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so&#10;we"/>

Our evening was a very, very happy one.&#10;&#10;&quot;So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my&#10;bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral&#10;close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow&#10;stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and&#10;cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of&#10;rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and&#10;housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that&#10;Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the&#10;clients.&#10;&#10;&quot;How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a&#10;day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my&#10;shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still.

<node id=" I dare not go yet, with so much on my&#10;shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to&#10;put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the&#10;long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden&#10;way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual&#10;placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the&#10;days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now&#10;I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,&#10;and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,&#10;and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,&#10;dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests&#10;you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his&#10;'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from the&#10;junior partner of the important firm Hawkins &amp; Harker; and so, as you&#10;love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and t"/>
<node id=" Lucy dear, I must tell some one,&#10;for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan&#10;tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming&#10;up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.&#10;Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his&#10;father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief&#10;mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few&#10;minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,&#10;&#10;&quot;Your loving&#10;&#10;&quot;MINA HARKER.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry&#10;to-night.

You&#10;will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my&#10;budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived&#10;at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had&#10;an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there&#10;were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After&#10;dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every&#10;blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with&#10;love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here&#10;with me.

Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.&#10;Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him&#10;that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either&#10;father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.&#10;Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,&#10;deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,&#10;and now at the end has treated"/>
<node id=" The Professor prevented Arthur's dying lover from kissing him because he believed it was necessary to protect Arthur from the unknown horrors that were afflicting Lucy. The Professor has good reasons for his actions, although they may not be immediately clear to others. He asks for John's trust, emphasizing that there may be times when John will not understand his actions, but should still trust in his judgment.&#10;&#10;The Professor explains that he has been a friend to John and to Lucy for many years, and that he has always acted with good cause. He cites an example where he prevented Arthur from kissing Lucy as she was dying, and how Lucy thanked him for it with her dying eyes and voice. The Professor then asked for Arthur's permission to read Lucy's papers and letters, emphasizing that it is not idle curiosity, but rather a desire to understand and protect her.&#10;&#10;John should continue to trust the Professor because of his long history of acting with good cause, his demonstrated love and concern for Lucy and Arthur, and his expertise in the unknown horrors that are afflicting Lucy. The Professor is a man of integrity who has always acted in the best interests of those he cares for, and John has no reason to doubt his intentions or his judgment."/>
<node id=" and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant&#10;things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet&#10;did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but&#10;man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you&#10;send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay&#10;horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was&#10;dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw&#10;how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so&#10;weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not&#10;hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many&#10;years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so&#10;strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend&#10;John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that"/>
<node id=" not yet understand. And there may be&#10;more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may&#10;not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust&#10;shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as&#10;though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from&#10;first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her&#10;dear sake to whom I swore to protect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And, indeed, indeed, sir,&quot; said Arthur warmly, &quot;I shall in all ways&#10;trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are&#10;Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to&#10;speak, and finally said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;May I ask you something now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, poor dear; I never thought of it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.

And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for&#10;your goodness to my poor dear.&quot; He paused a moment, and went on: &quot;I know&#10;that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was&#10;rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember&quot;--the&#10;Professor nodded--&quot;you must forgive me.&quot;&#10;&#10;He answered with a grave kindness:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such&#10;violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you&#10;cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand.

I took them&#10;before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch&#10;them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep&#10;them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them&#10;safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back&#10;to you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for&#10;Lucy's sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I&#10;am doing what my dear one would have approved.

But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then&#10;what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,&#10;and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though&#10;no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,&#10;am bigamist.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't see where the joke comes in there either!&quot; I said; and I did&#10;not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid&#10;his hand on my arm, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Friend John, forgive me if I pain.

Then he turned to Arthur, and said&#10;to him: &quot;Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the&#10;forehead, and only once.&quot;&#10;&#10;Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.&#10;&#10;Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took&#10;Arthur's arm, and drew him away.&#10;&#10;And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it&#10;ceased.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is all over,&quot; said Van Helsing. &quot;She is dead!&quot;&#10;&#10;I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he&#10;sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that&#10;nearly broke me down to see.&#10;"/>
<node id=" Based on the narrative, Quincey Morris and Dr. Seward are expected to discuss private matters after Dr. Seward returns from making funeral arrangements for Mrs. Westenra. The exact nature of their discussion is not specified in the text. However, the context suggests that they might be discussing the situation with Lucy, as Quincey expresses his anxiety for her and offers to watch over her and search for what may be needed. It is also possible that they may be discussing the mysterious circumstances surrounding Lucy's illness and Mrs. Westenra's death, as Van Helsing has been looking for specific things and has found some letters, memoranda, and a new diary."/>
<node id=" telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he&#10;may be:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and&#10;that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor&#10;Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have&#10;lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our&#10;troubles.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has&#10;taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe&#10;in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any&#10;of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America&#10;can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world&#10;indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his&#10;journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns"/>
<node id="&#10;&quot;Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be&#10;sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that&#10;love her.

Now go.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him&#10;that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now&#10;going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him&#10;where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to&#10;ourselves?&quot; I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about&#10;the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in&#10;the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.&#10;&#10;When I got back Quincey was waiting for me.

<node id=" who will open his&#10;veins for her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter with me, anyhow?&quot;&#10;&#10;The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought&#10;relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van&#10;Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a&#10;glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: &quot;Quincey Morris!&quot; and&#10;rushed towards him with outstretched hands.&#10;&#10;&quot;What brought you here?&quot; I cried as our hands met.&#10;&#10;&quot;I guess Art is the cause.&quot;&#10;&#10;He handed me a telegram:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.&#10;Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.&#10;Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell&#10;me what to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in&#10;the eyes as he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when"/>

She was still&#10;sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her&#10;side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he&#10;expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.&#10;So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where&#10;the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or&#10;rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said&#10;to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no&#10;right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl&#10;and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't&#10;help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong&#10;with her?

<node id="&#10;Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch&#10;here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself&#10;search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into&#10;the hands of strangers.&quot;&#10;&#10;I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found&#10;the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to&#10;him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions&#10;regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the&#10;letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,&#10;saying:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to&#10;you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you got what you looked for?&quot; I asked, to which he replied:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I&#10;have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a&#10;diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present"/>

This could be a result of the trauma he experienced during his time in Transylvania.&#10;&#10;The telegram from Van Helsing indicates that Mrs. Westenra passed away five days ago, and Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried yesterday. This is a source of great sorrow for Mina, as she held both women in high regard."/>
<node id=" a cup of tea somewhere.&quot; He had evidently forgotten&#10;all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that&#10;this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into&#10;forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must&#10;not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow&#10;learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I&#10;must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,&#10;I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear&#10;soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight&#10;relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he&#10;may be:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five"/>
<node id=" ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I&#10;watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.&#10;&#10;Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must&#10;not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the&#10;flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour&#10;was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case&#10;himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would&#10;send me word when to come.&#10;&#10;After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and&#10;seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.&#10;&#10;What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life&#10;amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Lucy Westenra's Diary._&#10;&#10;_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace.

It is as if I had passed through some&#10;long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and&#10;feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim"/>
<node id=" what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the&#10;paper, saying:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know&#10;and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what&#10;is it that you came to me to say?&quot; This brought me back to fact, and I&#10;was all myself again.&#10;&#10;&quot;I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act&#10;properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have&#10;to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we&#10;had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you&#10;know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra&#10;had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us&#10;fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the&#10;registrar and go on to the undertaker.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be&#10;sad in the foes that beset her, is"/>
<node id=" The positive effect of the flowers and garlic on the speaker's comfort and impending sleep can be explained by their use as a form of therapy, prescribed by Dr. Van Helsing, to ward off the evil forces that have been causing Lucy's distress. The flowers, specifically, have a calming effect on Lucy, making her feel at ease and helping her to sleep. The garlic, on the other hand, is used as a protective measure, keeping the evil forces at bay and providing a sense of security. In the context of Lucy's previous fears and dreads related to sleep, the flowers and garlic offer a sense of comfort and safety, allowing her to sleep without fear. It is also worth noting that Lucy's improved health and strength may be due to the overall treatment plan prescribed by Dr. Van Helsing, which includes rest, fresh air, and nutrition."/>
<node id="&#10;_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.&#10;Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He&#10;positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been&#10;right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread&#10;being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not&#10;mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I&#10;have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,&#10;or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has&#10;for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no&#10;dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings&#10;nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,&#10;and lying like Ophelia in the play, with &quot;virgin crants and maiden&#10;strewments.&quot; I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!&#10;There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,&#10;everybody.&#10;&#10;&#10;"/>
<node id=" It struck me as curious that the moment she&#10;became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was&#10;certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the&#10;stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she&#10;waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any&#10;mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many&#10;spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.&#10;&#10;At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen&#10;into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face&#10;I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a&#10;sharp whisper: &quot;Draw up the blind; I want light!&quot; Then he bent down,&#10;and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He&#10;removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As&#10;he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, &quot;Mein&#10;Gott!&quot; as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked"/>
<node id=" passed through some&#10;long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and&#10;feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim&#10;half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness&#10;in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress&#10;more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to&#10;life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,&#10;however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems&#10;to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my&#10;wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed&#10;so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and&#10;commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now&#10;without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown&#10;quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from&#10;Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a&#10;day in Amsterdam. But I need not be"/>
<node id="asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I&#10;should disturb her.&quot; The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He&#10;rubbed his hands together, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,&quot; to&#10;which she answered:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this&#10;morning is due in part to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How you do mean, ma'am?&quot; asked the Professor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into&#10;her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did&#10;not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those&#10;horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually&#10;a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be&#10;too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away&#10;and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be&#10;pleased with her, I am sure.&quot;&#10;"/>
<node id=", and I on the other, and our sympathy will&#10;be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we&#10;sleep.&quot; Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's&#10;face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay&#10;quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it&#10;should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,&#10;as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the&#10;window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk&#10;handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of&#10;the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and&#10;her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her&#10;teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they&#10;had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the&#10;canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,&#10;and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there"/>
<node id=" Lucy's health has significantly improved, as she has experienced four days and nights of peace and is getting stronger. However, Van Helsing still takes precautions by watching over her at night and insisting that nothing be removed from her room without his consent, as he believes the flowers and their odor are part of her cure.&#10;&#10;Upon seeing Lucy, Mrs. Westenra took precautions to protect her privacy and avoid an inquest into her death by examining Lucy's papers herself and avoiding the coroner. She also filled out the certificate of death, stating that Lucy died of heart disease. Van Helsing, who is both a lawyer and a doctor, supported this decision and took the certificate to the registrar himself."/>
<node id="&#10;at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his&#10;father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been&#10;bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon&#10;ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's&#10;papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a&#10;foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and&#10;so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But&#10;this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the&#10;coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such&#10;as this.&quot;&#10;&#10;As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been&#10;in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.&#10;&#10;&quot;When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.&#10;Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch&#10;here in the room and in Miss Lucy's"/>
<node id=" Based on the narrative, Quincey Morris and Dr. Seward are expected to discuss private matters related to the situation with Lucy Westenra after Dr. Seward returns from making funeral arrangements for Mrs. Westenra. The exact nature of their discussion is not specified, but it is likely that they will discuss Lucy's illness and the mysterious circumstances surrounding it, as Van Helsing has been looking for specific things and has found some letters, memoranda, and a new diary. Quincey has also expressed his anxiety for Lucy and offered to watch over her and search for what may be needed."/>
<node id=" The son's sadness and constraint are due to the loss of his father, who was a dear and good man and had been a mentor and father figure to him. He is also overwhelmed by the responsibility of the fortune left to him by his father. He expressed his gratitude towards the speaker for their close relationship with his late mother by saying that she had told him about their attachment and that there was no friend who had a closer place in her heart than the speaker. He also broke down in tears and hugged the speaker, expressing his despair at the loss of his mother and his inability to think of living without her."/>

He says the&#10;amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He&#10;begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_&#10;helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave&#10;shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard&#10;that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which&#10;enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master&#10;in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its&#10;strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in&#10;the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,&#10;for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan&#10;tries me, and I have no"/>
<node id=" we could avoid were saved.&#10;&#10;Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart&#10;manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his&#10;much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly&#10;attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a&#10;bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he&#10;was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some&#10;constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to&#10;bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I&#10;felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and&#10;led me in, saying huskily:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was&#10;no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to&#10;thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet....&quot;&#10;&#10;Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and"/>
<node id=" you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet....&quot;&#10;&#10;Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and&#10;laid his head on my breast, crying:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me&#10;all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.&quot;&#10;&#10;I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much&#10;expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the&#10;shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's&#10;heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said&#10;softly to him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Come and look at her.&quot;&#10;&#10;Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.&#10;God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her&#10;loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he&#10;fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At&#10;last, after a long pause, he"/>

For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come&#10;into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her&#10;mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no&#10;will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been&#10;treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,&#10;though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the&#10;inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just&#10;rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure&#10;you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.&quot;&#10;&#10;He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which&#10;he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an&#10;object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.&#10;&#10;He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and&#10;see Lord Godalming.

<node id=" Based on the narrative, Mina and Jonathan are facing several hardships and must undertake certain duties before they can reach a positive outcome.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jonathan is struggling with the grief of losing Mr. Hawkins, his prosperity, and the responsibility that comes with his newfound wealth. He is also experiencing the physical and emotional effects of the stress and strain brought about by these changes, as well as the trauma he experienced in Transylvania. Mina, on the other hand, is dealing with the shock of Jonathan's recent illness and the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance for him.&#10;&#10;In addition to their personal struggles, Mina and Jonathan are also involved in the situation with Lucy Westenra, who is suffering from a mysterious illness. Van Helsing, Quincey Morris, and Dr. Seward are discussing private matters related to Lucy's situation, and it is likely that Mina and Jonathan will play a role in addressing it.&#10;&#10;Professor Van Helsing suggests that they must be &quot;brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty&quot; in order to reach a positive outcome. This implies that Mina and Jonathan must face their hardships and fulfill their responsibilities, even if it causes them pain or discomfort.&#10;&#10;The exact nature of these hardships and duties is not specified in the narrative, but it is clear that Mina and Jonathan must confront and overcome their personal struggles and play a role in addressing Lucy's situation in order to reach a positive outcome."/>
<node id=". I shall not trouble you&#10;with questions till the time comes.&quot;&#10;&#10;The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be&#10;all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of&#10;all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we&#10;reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our&#10;duty, and all will be well!&quot;&#10;&#10;I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing did not go to&#10;bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was&#10;never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with&#10;the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,&#10;a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal._&#10;&#10;_22 September._--In the train to Exeter.

<node id=" Thomas Bilder is the keeper of the wolf department at the Zoological Gardens. He is an elderly man, married and without children. He and his wife, whose name is not mentioned, live in a cottage in the enclosure behind the elephant-house. They are hospitable and seem to lead comfortable lives, as suggested by the supper and tea they offered to the interviewer. Bilder is experienced in dealing with animals and has a close relationship with them, as indicated by his concern for the escaped wolf's injuries. He is cautious and careful, as shown by his warning to the interviewer about the wolf's quickness. Bilder is also modest, as evidenced by his suspicious modesty when asked if he can account for the wolf's escape. He is well-respected and considered a good friend by keepers. Bilder and his wife have a good sense of humor, as shown by their laughter at the idea that the wolf escaped because he wanted to get out. They also have a kind and compassionate nature, as demonstrated by their care for the escaped wolf and their concern for the interviewer's safety."/>
<node id="ogical Gardens._&#10;&#10;After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using&#10;the words &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; as a sort of talisman, I managed to find&#10;the keeper of the section of the Zooelogical Gardens in which the wolf&#10;department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in&#10;the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to&#10;his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,&#10;elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their&#10;hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty&#10;comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called &quot;business&quot;&#10;until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the&#10;table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose me&#10;refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals.

My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the&#10;wolf?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir,&quot; he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, &quot;I think I can;&#10;but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly I shall.

<node id=" to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so&#10;well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a&#10;personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.&#10;&#10;After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor&#10;his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal&#10;itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all&#10;picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her&#10;confidence in masquerade.&#10;&#10;The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The&#10;wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the&#10;children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of&#10;penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine&#10;prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender&#10;solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;&#10;didn't I say it all along?

<node id=" The mysterious events in Hampstead involve young children straying from home and associating with a &quot;bloofer lady,&quot; which is similar to the Kensington Horror. The children have tiny wounds in their throats, suggesting that they have been bitten by some animal or creature. The police are keeping a lookout for stray dogs in the area. The use of the term &quot;bloofer,&quot; which is a childish mispronunciation of &quot;buffer,&quot; and the description of the &quot;bloofer lady&quot; as an attractive figure suggest that the children may be under the influence or spell of a glamorous but dangerous entity. The true nature of this entity is not yet revealed in the narrative."/>

It has the same tiny wound in the&#10;throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and&#10;looked quite emaciated.

Our correspondent naively says&#10;that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of&#10;these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine&#10;themselves--to be.&#10;&#10;There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of&#10;the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been&#10;slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be&#10;made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance&#10;individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has&#10;a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been&#10;instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially&#10;when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog&#10;which may be about.&#10;&#10;&#10;               _&quot;The Westminster Gazette,&quot; 25 September._&#10;&#10;                           "/>

It is&#10;generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed&#10;gave as his reason for being away that a &quot;bloofer lady&quot; had asked him to&#10;come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as&#10;occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the&#10;little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A&#10;correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to&#10;be the &quot;bloofer lady&quot; is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists&#10;might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the&#10;reality and the picture.

<node id=" gently&#10;and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her&#10;mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,&#10;finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed&#10;the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an&#10;hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but&#10;more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only&#10;the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this&#10;desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing&#10;tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too&#10;late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of&#10;danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;&#10;and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry&#10;anywhere.&#10;&#10;I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and&#10;locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the&#10;rapid pit-pat of a"/>
<node id=" The Professor prevented Arthur's dying lover, Lucy, from kissing him because he believed that there were unknown horrors afflicting her that could also harm Arthur. The Professor's actions were based on his desire to protect Arthur and Lucy. At the time, this may not have been clear to others, but Lucy herself understood and appreciated the Professor's actions, as evidenced by her dying eyes and voice thanking him.&#10;&#10;The Professor also asked for Arthur's permission to read Lucy's papers and letters, emphasizing that it was not out of idle curiosity, but rather a desire to understand and protect her. The Professor has a long history of acting with good cause and has always acted in the best interests of those he cares for. He is a man of integrity and expertise in the unknown horrors that are afflicting Lucy.&#10;&#10;Therefore, John should continue to trust the Professor because of his long history of acting with good cause, his demonstrated love and concern for Lucy and Arthur, and his expertise in the unknown horrors that are afflicting Lucy. John has no reason to doubt the Professor's intentions or judgment."/>
<node id=" The latest child injury on Hampstead Heath involves a child who went missing and was found the next day with a tiny wound in the throat, similar to previous cases. The child reported being lured away by the &quot;bloofer lady.&quot; The cause of the wound is not definitively known, but it is suggested that it may have been inflicted by a rat or small dog. The children's accounts of the &quot;bloofer lady&quot; are likely influenced by their favorite game of luring each other away by wiles, with some of them pretending to be the &quot;bloofer lady&quot; in a supremely funny manner."/>
<node id=" Quincey Morris provides urgent help by responding to Arthur's anxious telegram about Lucy's condition and coming to check on her. His reassurance comes from his readiness to support the group in any way needed, demonstrating his bravery and loyalty.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing implies that Quincey's arrival is significant because he believes that a brave man's blood, like Quincey's, can be beneficial in their situation, possibly referring to the earlier transfusions Lucy received. Additionally, Van Helsing sees Quincey as a strong and reliable ally, which is an important asset for the challenges they are facing."/>
<node id=". Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his&#10;journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns&#10;to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can&#10;only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says&#10;he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old&#10;fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his&#10;iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting&#10;some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were&#10;standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in&#10;the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I&#10;could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was&#10;saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married&#10;and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of&#10;the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went&#10;away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here"/>
<node id=" the maids&#10;to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down&#10;after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good&#10;breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where&#10;Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or&#10;two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was&#10;thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look&#10;of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.&#10;He handed me the paper saying only: &quot;It dropped from Lucy's breast when&#10;we carried her to the bath.&quot;&#10;&#10;When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause&#10;asked him: &quot;In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,&#10;mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?&quot; I was so bewildered that I&#10;did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the&#10;paper, saying:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do not trouble about it now. Forget"/>
<node id=" Lucy's condition is deteriorating based on several changes in her behavior and appearance. First, she becomes lethargic and has difficulty breathing, which is described as &quot;stertorous breathing.&quot; This is concerning because it suggests that she is struggling to get enough air. Second, her teeth, particularly her canine teeth, appear longer and sharper than before. This is a disturbing development as it may indicate a transformation in Lucy.&#10;&#10;In contrast to her previous aversion to the garlic flowers, Lucy now clutches them close to her when she is conscious. This change in behavior suggests that she finds comfort in the flowers and may associate them with protection or relief from her distress. However, whenever she falls into a lethargic state, she tears away the flowers from her throat, indicating that the effect of the flowers is not strong enough to keep her condition from worsening during these episodes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the fact that Lucy's mother, who was covered with a white sheet, had the flowers on her bosom and Lucy's throat was bare, showing the two little wounds, suggests that Lucy's condition has deteriorated to the point where she is no longer able to keep the flowers around her neck. This is a worrying sign, as it indicates that her condition is worsening even when she is conscious and able to take measures to protect herself."/>
<node id="&#10;canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,&#10;and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort&#10;of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,&#10;and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,&#10;and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled&#10;round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now&#10;and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,&#10;I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic&#10;flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat&#10;watching her.&#10;&#10;Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.&#10;She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with&#10;her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto&#10;so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she&#10;became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was&#10;certainly odd that whenever she got"/>
<node id=" to them later.&quot;&#10;Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the&#10;door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white&#10;faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the&#10;room.&#10;&#10;How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her&#10;mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white&#10;sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the&#10;broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror&#10;fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more&#10;drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her&#10;mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds&#10;which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.&#10;Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching&#10;poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who&#10;listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not yet too late! Quick! quick"/>
<node id=" Renfield, a patient under the care of Dr. Seward, had another outbreak during which he became agitated and aggressive towards a carrier's cart driver who had stopped at the empty house adjacent to the grounds of the mental health facility. Renfield accused the driver of wanting to rob and murder him, and made vulgar remarks. This behavior is consistent with Renfield's previous actions and delusions, and it is unrelated to the mysterious events in Hampstead. The empty house holds significance as it is the same house that Renfield had previously run away to twice, indicating a fixation on the property."/>

With regard to patient, Renfield, there&#10;is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a&#10;dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended&#10;with any unhappy results.

<node id=" Jonathan's nervousness and self-doubt are due to the responsibility that comes with the fortune he received from his lifelong friend. This fortune is a significant change in his life, and he may feel overwhelmed by the sudden increase in wealth and the responsibilities that come with it. His self-doubt may stem from his fear of not being able to live up to the expectations that come with his newfound wealth.&#10;&#10;The &quot;grave shock&quot; that Jonathan experienced in Transylvania may have also contributed to his nervousness and self-doubt. This shock may have caused some injury to his brain, as Mina suspects, which could affect his mental and emotional state.&#10;&#10;Jonathan's noble nature has been affected by this nervousness and self-doubt, as Mina notes that &quot;the very essence of its strength is gone.&quot; His noble nature, which enabled him to rise from clerk to master in a few years, has been weakened by his current state of mind. However, Mina's belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself, indicating that his noble nature has not been entirely lost."/>
<node id=" me, and he said&#10;under his breath: &quot;My God!&quot; I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I&#10;fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him&#10;quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.&#10;&#10;He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and&#10;half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and&#10;black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty&#10;girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,&#10;and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was&#10;hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all&#10;the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.&#10;Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I&#10;feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked&#10;Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that&#10;I knew as much about it as he did: &quot;Do you see who it is?&quot;&#10;&#10;"/>

<node id=", so I answered&#10;in the same phrase: &quot;That's so.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how long has this been going on?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About ten days.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature&#10;that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood&#10;of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it.&quot; Then,&#10;coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: &quot;What took it&#10;out?&quot;&#10;&#10;I shook my head. &quot;That,&quot; I said, &quot;is the crux. Van Helsing is simply&#10;frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.&#10;There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out&#10;all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall&#10;not occur again.

<node id=" In the narrative, several measures are being taken to care for Arthur's well-being and ensure the group can continue watching over Lucy. First, Quincey Morris has arrived in response to Arthur's anxious telegram about Lucy's condition, providing necessary support and assistance to Dr. Seward. Van Helsing views Quincey as a strong and reliable ally, implying that his presence will be beneficial in their efforts to help Lucy. Quincey offers to stay and do whatever is needed to ensure Lucy's well-being, providing additional manpower and support for the group.&#10;&#10;After Lucy's death, Dr. Seward and Van Helsing encourage Arthur to rest, understanding that he needs support during this challenging time. Van Helsing kindly offers Arthur companionship and a place to rest, acknowledging that being alone can exacerbate feelings of fear and alarm.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mina Harker plans to visit Lucy's grave and offer support to Arthur during their time in London. She understands the importance of their group remaining strong and cohesive, especially since they will all be grieving the loss of Lucy and her mother.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the group is committed to fulfilling the wishes of the deceased, such as Mr. Hawkins' request to be buried with his father, which requires Jonathan to be the chief mourner. This sense of duty and respect for the departed helps the group maintain a sense of normalcy and purpose during this difficult time."/>
<node id=" the wings of the angel of death. And he has&#10;been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother&#10;and Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.&#10;&#10;I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to&#10;go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him&#10;that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not&#10;all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed&#10;to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. &quot;Come, my child,&quot; he said;&#10;&quot;come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much&#10;mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You&#10;must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.&#10;Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two&#10;sofas.

<node id=" The person, Thomas Bilder, uses various methods to question wolves, jackals, and hyenas, such as hitting them over the head with a pole or scratching their ears. This is similar to how the speaker questions Bilder about his business, as the speaker persistently asks him questions despite Bilder's initial grumpiness. Bilder waits until after he and the animals have had their &quot;sherry and kawffee,&quot; or tea and supper, before engaging in these activities, showing his consideration and care for their well-being. This is also reflected in his interaction with the speaker, as he offers him supper and waits until after they have eaten before discussing business. Overall, Bilder's approach to questioning animals and interacting with the speaker highlights his patience, care, and respect for others."/>

<node id=" The &quot;grave shock&quot; that Jonathan experienced in Transylvania and the newfound responsibility that comes with his wealth have significantly impacted him, causing him to doubt himself and lose the essence of his strength. This is expressed through his nervousness, self-doubt, and the weakening of his noble nature, which had previously enabled him to rise from clerk to master in a few years. The shock may have caused some injury to his brain, further contributing to his mental and emotional state. The responsibility he now holds makes him anxious, as he fears not being able to live up to expectations. Mina's belief in him helps him regain some confidence, but the strain of keeping up a brave appearance takes a toll on her as well. These challenges, along with Jonathan's recent illness and their involvement in Lucy Westenra's mysterious illness, require Mina and Jonathan to be brave, unselfish, and fulfill their duties to reach a positive outcome."/>
<node id=" Quincey Morris's arrival plays an urgent role in addressing the situation with Lucy by providing necessary support and assistance to Dr. Seward. His arrival is significant due to his bravery and loyalty, as demonstrated by his immediate response to Arthur's anxious telegram about Lucy's condition. Van Helsing also views Quincey as a strong and reliable ally, implying that his presence will be beneficial in their efforts to help Lucy.&#10;&#10;Quincey's background as a brave man is particularly beneficial because Van Helsing believes that a brave man's blood can be advantageous in their situation. This likely refers to the earlier transfusions Lucy received, where Quincey had willingly offered his blood to help her. By having Quincey present, the group gains additional manpower and support, which is crucial given the mysterious circumstances surrounding Lucy's illness. Quincey's readiness to support the group in any way needed demonstrates his commitment to helping Lucy and addressing the urgent situation at hand."/>
<node id=" The narrator's mother passed away, and this event is described at the beginning of the narrative. The narrator is in a state of shock, pain, and terror due to this loss. The maids, who were awakened by the sounds of a passing bell, howling dogs, and a nightingale, entered the room after the narrator called for them. Upon seeing the deceased mother, the maids screamed and one of the doors slammed shut due to the wind. The maids became frightened and the narrator directed them to have a glass of wine in the dining room. After they left, the narrator laid flowers on his mother's breast. When he went to look for the maids, he found them lying on the floor in the dining room, having been affected by laudanum that was put in the sherry decanter. The narrator is now alone with his mother's body and is trying to figure out what to do next."/>
<node id=" again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the&#10;dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,&#10;seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and&#10;stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the&#10;nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort&#10;me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear&#10;their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they&#10;came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay&#10;over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the&#10;broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my&#10;dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I&#10;had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them&#10;to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew&#10;open for an instant and closed again.

<node id="&#10;open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went&#10;in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear&#10;mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing&#10;had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would&#10;have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that&#10;the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went&#10;to the dining-room to look for them.&#10;&#10;My heart sank when I saw what had happened.

<node id=" The Professor, Van Helsing, is asking for Arthur's permission to read and keep safe all of Miss Lucy's papers and letters. He explains that he took them before they knew that Lucy's estate was now Arthur's, so that no one else could read her personal thoughts and words. He wants to keep them safe and give them back to Arthur in good time. This is important for Lucy's sake because the Professor believes that there may be something in her papers that will help them understand and deal with the unknown horrors that are afflicting her. He emphasizes that his motive is not idle curiosity, but a desire to help and protect Lucy."/>
<node id=" In the narrative, Quincey Morris's arrival is significant because he has been implied to be a suitable donor for a transfusion due to his bravery and loyalty. Both Van Helsing and the speaker are exhausted, and they need to find someone who can donate blood to help Lucy. Quincey, with his readiness to support the group in any way needed, is suggested as a potential donor by Van Helsing. This is indicated when Van Helsing says, &quot;What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?&quot; and then expresses relief after realizing that Quincey has arrived."/>

He wore a look of stern sadness and&#10;infinite pity.&#10;&#10;&quot;As I expected,&quot; he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which&#10;meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then&#10;began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another&#10;operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the&#10;necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a&#10;warning hand. &quot;No!&quot; he said. &quot;To-day you must operate. I shall provide.&#10;You are weakened already.&quot; As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled&#10;up his shirt-sleeve.&#10;&#10;Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to&#10;the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.

<node id=" Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, burst into his study with a distorted face after attacking a doctor who was trying to restrain him. Renfield had become agitated and aggressive, believing that the doctor was there to rob and murder him. He struck the doctor with a dinner-knife, cutting his wrist, and then proceeded to lick the blood off the floor &quot;like a dog.&quot; This behavior is consistent with Renfield's previous actions and delusions, as he has a history of collecting and consuming live insects and spiders in the belief that it will give him strength. However, the attack on the doctor and the licking of the blood off the floor is an escalation of his previous behavior, possibly due to his increasingly deranged state of mind.&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward was surprised by Renfield's behavior because it was an unexpected escalation of his previous actions. While Renfield had a history of aggressive and delusional behavior, attacking a doctor and licking blood off the floor was a new and disturbing development. This behavior may have been triggered by Renfield's fixation on the empty house adjacent to the mental health facility, as he had previously run away to the house twice. The attack on the doctor may have been a result of Renfield's paranoia and delusional beliefs, and the licking of the blood off the floor may have been driven by a strong and irresistible urge, possibly due to his mental illness."/>
<node id=" Bilder and his wife had a surprising reaction of comedy and pathos towards the wolf that had caused a commotion in London. When they found the wolf, he was in a penitent mood and was received and petted like a vulpine prodigal son. Bilder examined the wolf's injuries, which included a head full of broken glass. The wolf, who they called Bersicker, was one of three grey wolves that they had bought from Jamrach four years ago. He was a well-behaved wolf who had never given them any trouble before."/>
<node id=" Quincey Morris's arrival provides urgent help by bringing necessary support and assistance to Dr. Seward in addressing Lucy's critical situation. His arrival is urgent due to his bravery and loyalty, as demonstrated by his immediate response to Arthur's anxious telegram about Lucy's condition. Van Helsing also views Quincey as a strong and reliable ally, implying that his presence will be beneficial in their efforts to help Lucy.&#10;&#10;The reassurance comes from Quincey's readiness to support the group in any way needed, which is crucial given the mysterious circumstances surrounding Lucy's illness. Additionally, Quincey's background as a brave man makes him a suitable candidate for blood transfusion, as Van Helsing believes that a brave man's blood can be advantageous in their situation, possibly referring to the earlier transfusions Lucy received. Quincey's eagerness to assist is shown through his offer to stay and do whatever is needed to ensure Lucy's well-being, providing additional manpower and support for the group."/>
<node id=" In the narrative, Lucy Westenra is undergoing a strange transformation which is causing her to speak and breathe differently. The exact nature of this transformation is not explicitly stated, but it is likely related to her mysterious illness and the evil forces that have been causing her distress. Dr. Van Helsing has been looking for specific things and has found some letters, memoranda, and a new diary, which suggests that he is trying to understand and find a solution to Lucy's condition.&#10;&#10;In response to Lucy's strange transformation, Dr. Van Helsing has prescribed a form of therapy involving flowers and garlic. The flowers, specifically, have a calming effect on Lucy, making her feel at ease and helping her to sleep. The garlic, on the other hand, is used as a protective measure, keeping the evil forces at bay and providing a sense of security. This therapy is an attempt to ward off the evil forces that have been causing Lucy's distress and to provide her with a sense of comfort and safety, allowing her to sleep without fear.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Lucy's improved health and strength may be due to the overall treatment plan prescribed by Dr. Van Helsing, which includes rest, fresh air, and nutrition. However, despite these efforts, Lucy's condition continues to be a source of concern for her friends and loved ones."/>

However, the attack on the doctor and the licking of the blood off the floor is an escalation of his previous behavior, possibly due to his increasingly deranged state of mind.&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward was surprised by Renfield's behavior because it was an unexpected escalation of his previous actions. While Renfield had a history of aggressive and delusional behavior, attacking a doctor and licking blood off the floor was a new and disturbing development.

The attack on the doctor may have been a result of Renfield's paranoia and delusional beliefs, and the licking of the blood off the floor may have been driven by a strong and irresistible urge, possibly due to his mental illness.">

However, the attack on the doctor and the licking of the blood off the floor is an escalation of his previous behavior, possibly due to his increasingly deranged state of mind.&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward was surprised by Renfield's behavior because it was an unexpected escalation of his previous actions. While Renfield had a history of aggressive and delusional behavior, attacking a doctor and licking blood off the floor was a new and disturbing development. This behavior may have been triggered by Renfield's fixation on the empty house adjacent to the mental health facility, as he had previously run away to the house twice. The attack on the doctor may have been a result of Renfield's paranoia and delusional beliefs, and the licking of the blood off the floor may have been driven by a strong and irresistible urge, possibly due to his mental illness.">

Renfield had become agitated and aggressive, believing that the doctor was there to rob and murder him. He struck the doctor with a dinner-knife, cutting his wrist, and then proceeded to lick the blood off the floor &quot;like a dog.&quot; This behavior is consistent with Renfield's previous actions and delusions, as he has a history of collecting and consuming live insects and spiders in the belief that it will give him strength. However, the attack on the doctor and the licking of the blood off the floor is an escalation of his previous behavior, possibly due to his increasingly deranged state of mind.&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward was surprised by Renfield's behavior because it was an unexpected escalation of his previous actions. While Renfield had a history of aggressive and delusional behavior, attacking a doctor and licking blood off the floor was a new and disturbing development. This behavior may have been triggered by Renfield's fixation on the empty house adjacent to the mental health facility, as he had previously run away to the house twice. The attack on the doctor may have been a result of Renfield's paranoia and delusional beliefs, and the licking of the blood off the floor may have been driven by a strong and irresistible urge, possibly due to his mental illness.">

The flowers, specifically, have a calming effect on Lucy, making her feel at ease and helping her to sleep. The garlic, on the other hand, is used as a protective measure, keeping the evil forces at bay and providing a sense of security. This therapy is an attempt to ward off the evil forces that have been causing Lucy's distress and to provide her with a sense of comfort and safety, allowing her to sleep without fear.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Lucy's improved health and strength may be due to the overall treatment plan prescribed by Dr. Van Helsing, which includes rest, fresh air, and nutrition.

The shock may have caused some injury to his brain, further contributing to his mental and emotional state. The responsibility he now holds makes him anxious, as he fears not being able to live up to expectations. Mina's belief in him helps him regain some confidence, but the strain of keeping up a brave appearance takes a toll on her as well.

When he went to look for the maids, he found them lying on the floor in the dining room, having been affected by laudanum that was put in the sherry decanter. The narrator is now alone with his mother's body and is trying to figure out what to do next.">

Renfield had become agitated and aggressive, believing that the doctor was there to rob and murder him. He struck the doctor with a dinner-knife, cutting his wrist, and then proceeded to lick the blood off the floor &quot;like a dog.&quot; This behavior is consistent with Renfield's previous actions and delusions, as he has a history of collecting and consuming live insects and spiders in the belief that it will give him strength. However, the attack on the doctor and the licking of the blood off the floor is an escalation of his previous behavior, possibly due to his increasingly deranged state of mind.&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward was surprised by Renfield's behavior because it was an unexpected escalation of his previous actions. While Renfield had a history of aggressive and delusional behavior, attacking a doctor and licking blood off the floor was a new and disturbing development. This behavior may have been triggered by Renfield's fixation on the empty house adjacent to the mental health facility, as he had previously run away to the house twice. The attack on the doctor may have been a result of Renfield's paranoia and delusional beliefs, and the licking of the blood off the floor may have been driven by a strong and irresistible urge, possibly due to his mental illness.">

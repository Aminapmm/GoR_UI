    <node id="Miss Everdene asked Gabriel Oak to leave her alone at that particular moment because she noticed Frank Troy, the man she truly loved, approaching her. She wanted Oak to turn back and go away so that she could have privacy with Troy. This is revealed in the text when it states, &quot;A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that point now ensued. A figure apparently rose from the earth beside her.

    <node id=" keep in this mind....  I hate taking my own measure&#10;so plain, but, upon my life, your provoking ways make a man say&#10;what he wouldn't dream of at other times!  I own to being rather&#10;interfering.  But you know well enough how it is, and who she is that&#10;I like too well, and feel too much like a fool about to be civil to&#10;her!&quot;&#10;&#10;It is more than probable that she privately and unconsciously&#10;respected him a little for this grim fidelity, which had been shown&#10;in his tone even more than in his words.  At any rate she murmured&#10;something to the effect that he might stay if he wished.  She said&#10;more distinctly, &quot;Will you leave me alone now?  I don't order it&#10;as a mistress--I ask it as a woman, and I expect you not to be so&#10;uncourteous as to refuse.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly I will, Miss Everdene,&quot; said Gabriel, gently.  He wondered&#10;that the request should have come at this moment, for the strife was&#10;over, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human&#10;habitation, and the hour was getting late." />
    <node id=", for the strife was&#10;over, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human&#10;habitation, and the hour was getting late.  He stood still and&#10;allowed her to get far ahead of him till he could only see her form&#10;upon the sky.&#10;&#10;A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that&#10;point now ensued.  A figure apparently rose from the earth beside&#10;her.  The shape beyond all doubt was Troy's.  Oak would not be even&#10;a possible listener, and at once turned back till a good two hundred&#10;yards were between the lovers and himself.&#10;&#10;Gabriel went home by way of the churchyard.  In passing the tower&#10;he thought of what she had said about the sergeant's virtuous habit&#10;of entering the church unperceived at the beginning of service.&#10;Believing that the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused,&#10;he ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which&#10;it stood, and examined it.  The pale lustre yet hanging in the&#10;north-western heaven was sufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had&#10;grown from the wall across the door to a length of more than a foot," />
    <node id="That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the&#10;fear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter&#10;from combating his or her errors.  Oak determined to speak to his&#10;mistress.  He would base his appeal on what he considered her unfair&#10;treatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from home.&#10;&#10;An opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short&#10;walk by a path through the neighbouring cornfields.  It was dusk when&#10;Oak, who had not been far a-field that day, took the same path and&#10;met her returning, quite pensively, as he thought.&#10;&#10;The wheat was now tall, and the path was narrow; thus the way was&#10;quite a sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side.&#10;Two persons could not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and&#10;Oak stood aside to let her pass.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, is it Gabriel?&quot; she said.  &quot;You are taking a walk too.&#10;Good-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather late,&quot; said Oak,&#10;turning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat&#10;quick" />
    <node id="ears.  Then she resumed rather&#10;tartly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood&#10;would naturally come to meet me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I meant on account of the wedding which they say is likely to take&#10;place between you and him, miss.  Forgive my speaking plainly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They say what is not true.&quot; she returned quickly.  &quot;No marriage is&#10;likely to take place between us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for the moment had&#10;come.  &quot;Well, Miss Everdene,&quot; he said, &quot;putting aside what people&#10;say, I never in my life saw any courting if his is not a courting&#10;of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba would probably have terminated the conversation there and&#10;then by flatly forbidding the subject, had not her conscious weakness&#10;of position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better&#10;it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Since this subject has been mentioned,&quot; she said very emphatically,&#10;&quot;I am glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very&#10;common and very provoking.  I didn't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood&#10;anything" />
    <node id=" make answer hencefor'ard, 'Of course a lady like Miss&#10;Everdene can't love him'; I'll say it out in plain black and white.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba burst out: &quot;O Liddy, are you such a simpleton?  Can't you&#10;read riddles?  Can't you see?  Are you a woman yourself?&quot;&#10;&#10;Liddy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy!&quot; she said, in reckless&#10;abandonment and grief.  &quot;Oh, I love him to very distraction and&#10;misery and agony!  Don't be frightened at me, though perhaps I am&#10;enough to frighten any innocent woman.  Come closer--closer.&quot; She&#10;put her arms round Liddy's neck.  &quot;I must let it out to somebody; it&#10;is wearing me away!  Don't you yet know enough of me to see through&#10;that miserable denial of mine?  O God, what a lie it was! Heaven and&#10;my Love forgive me.  And don't you know that a woman who loves at&#10;all thinks nothing of perjury when it is balanced against her love?&#10;There, go" />
    <node id=" Miss Everdene.  But surely you must have been told&#10;by everybody of what everybody notices?  And you should take their&#10;words for it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They don't say so exactly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, they must!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I mean to my face, as you do,&quot; she went on, allowing herself&#10;to be further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously&#10;forbidden.&#10;&#10;&quot;But you know they think so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--that is--I certainly have heard Liddy say they do, but--&quot;  She&#10;paused.&#10;&#10;Capitulation--that was the purport of the simple reply, guarded as it&#10;was--capitulation, unknown to herself.  Never did a fragile tailless&#10;sentence convey a more perfect meaning.  The careless sergeant smiled&#10;within himself, and probably too the devil smiled from a loop-hole in&#10;Tophet, for the moment was the turning-point of a career.  Her tone&#10;and mien signified beyond mistake that the seed which was to lift the&#10;foundation had taken root in the chink: the remainder was a mere&#10;question of time and natural changes.&#10;&#10;&quot;There" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Oak implies that Bathsheba and Boldwood's wedding is likely to take place since Boldwood has been pursuing her hand in marriage. Therefore, Oak suggests that if Boldwood were not away from home, he would naturally come to meet Bathsheba, perhaps to further discuss their potential union. However, it is revealed later in the narrative that Bathsheba informs Oak that no such wedding is likely to occur between them, and Oak shares his observation that Boldwood's behavior indicates that he is indeed courting her." />
    <node id=" thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather late,&quot; said Oak,&#10;turning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat&#10;quickly by him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, indeed, but I am not very fearful.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no; but there are bad characters about.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I never meet them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Now Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going to introduce the&#10;gallant sergeant through the channel of &quot;bad characters.&quot;  But all at&#10;once the scheme broke down, it suddenly occurring to him that this&#10;was rather a clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with.  He tried&#10;another preamble.&#10;&#10;&quot;And as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from&#10;home, too--I mean Farmer Boldwood--why, thinks I, I'll go,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, yes.&quot;  She walked on without turning her head, and for many&#10;steps nothing further was heard from her quarter than the rustle&#10;of her dress against the heavy corn-ears.  Then she resumed rather&#10;tartly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood&#10;would" />
    <node id=" afterwards: that Troy's&#10;presentation of himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was&#10;not by any distinctly preconcerted arrangement.  He had hinted--she&#10;had forbidden; and it was only on the chance of his still coming&#10;that she had dismissed Oak, fearing a meeting between them just&#10;then.&#10;&#10;She now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed by all these&#10;new and fevering sequences.  Then she jumped up with a manner of&#10;decision, and fetched her desk from a side table.&#10;&#10;In three minutes, without pause or modification, she had written a&#10;letter to Boldwood, at his address beyond Casterbridge, saying mildly&#10;but firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had&#10;brought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon; that&#10;her final decision was that she could not marry him.  She had&#10;expressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood came home before&#10;communicating to him her conclusive reply.  But Bathsheba found that&#10;she could not wait.&#10;&#10;It was impossible to send this letter till the next day; yet to quell&#10;her uneasiness by getting it out of her hands, and so" />
    <node id="I am glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very&#10;common and very provoking.  I didn't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood&#10;anything.  I have never cared for him.  I respect him, and he has&#10;urged me to marry him.  But I have given him no distinct answer.&#10;As soon as he returns I shall do so; and the answer will be that I&#10;cannot think of marrying him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;People are full of mistakes, seemingly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They are.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The other day they said you were trifling with him, and you almost&#10;proved that you were not; lately they have said that you be not, and&#10;you straightway begin to show--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That I am, I suppose you mean.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I hope they speak the truth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They do, but wrongly applied.  I don't trifle with him; but then, I&#10;have nothing to do with him.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood's rival in a wrong&#10;tone to her after all.  &quot;I wish you had never met that young Sergeant&#10;Troy, miss,&quot; he sighed.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="  I have lost in&#10;the race for money and good things, and I am not such a fool as to&#10;pretend to 'ee now I am poor, and you have got altogether above me.&#10;But Bathsheba, dear mistress, this I beg you to consider--that, both&#10;to keep yourself well honoured among the workfolk, and in common&#10;generosity to an honourable man who loves you as well as I, you&#10;should be more discreet in your bearing towards this soldier.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't, don't, don't!&quot; she exclaimed, in a choking voice.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are ye not more to me than my own affairs, and even life!&quot; he went&#10;on.  &quot;Come, listen to me!  I am six years older than you, and Mr.&#10;Boldwood is ten years older than I, and consider--I do beg of 'ee to&#10;consider before it is too late--how safe you would be in his hands!&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak's allusion to his own love for her lessened, to some extent, her&#10;anger at his interference; but she could not really forgive him for&#10;letting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her" />
    <node id="In the narrative, the speaker is Gabriel Oak, and the farm he refers to is owned by Bathsheba Everdene. Oak is willing to stay on the farm and continue working for her, even though she has made it clear that she does not want him there. He also suggests that Bathsheba should consider marrying Farmer Boldwood, who has been pursuing her hand in marriage, as a way to ensure the farm's success. Oak clarifies that he doesn't wish for Bathsheba to feel indebted to him because he wants to make it clear that his intentions are not self-serving. He believes that his suggestions are what is best for the farm and its owner, regardless of any personal gain he may receive. This shows Oak's dedication to the well-being of the farm and his sense of responsibility towards Bathsheba, even in the face of her rejection." />

I'll go at once if you'll promise that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall have no bailiff; I shall continue to be my own manager,&quot; she&#10;said decisively.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, then; you should be thankful to me for biding.

I don't want you--I beg you to go!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's nonsense,&quot; said Oak, calmly.  &quot;This is the second time you&#10;have pretended to dismiss me; and what's the use o' it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Pretended!

Her heart erratically&#10;flitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and&#10;almost tearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, &quot;Oh, what have I&#10;done!  What does it mean!  I wish I knew how much of it was true!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;HIVING THE BEES&#10;&#10;&#10;The Weatherbury bees" />
    <node id="Bathsheba insists that speaking to her isn't a hard request for the soldier because she believes that he has been ordered to do so by someone else, most likely Sergeant Troy. She wants to make it clear that she doesn't want to be involved in any disputes or conflicts between the two men. The significance of the offense that she agrees to inquire about is that it has something to do with the reason why the soldier was initially reluctant to speak to her. It is later revealed that the soldier's offence was his attraction towards Bathsheba, which he openly admits to her. By agreeing to inquire about the offense, Bathsheba unknowingly sets the stage for their future interactions and eventual romantic involvement." />
    <node id=" in that way, or in any other, unless I speak to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Miss Bathsheba!  That is too hard!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, it isn't.

She withdrew her own hand, but,&#10;whether by accident or design, he touched it.  Bathsheba was vexed;&#10;she hardly knew why.&#10;&#10;His unravelling went on, but it nevertheless seemed coming to no end.&#10;She looked at him again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!&quot; said the young&#10;sergeant, without ceremony.&#10;&#10;She coloured with embarrassment.  &quot;'Twas unwillingly shown,&quot; she&#10;replied, stiffly, and with as much dignity--which was very little--as&#10;she could infuse into a position of captivity.&#10;&#10;&quot;I like you the better for that incivility, miss,&quot; he said.&#10;" />
    <node id=" in a wrong&#10;tone to her after all.  &quot;I wish you had never met that young Sergeant&#10;Troy, miss,&quot; he sighed.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic.  &quot;Why?&quot; she asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;He is not good enough for 'ee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did any one tell you to speak to me like this?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nobody at all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not concern us here,&quot;&#10;she said, intractably. &quot;Yet I must say that Sergeant Troy is an&#10;educated man, and quite worthy of any woman.  He is well born.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;His being higher in learning and birth than the ruck o' soldiers&#10;is anything but a proof of his worth.  It show's his course to be&#10;down'ard.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot see what this has to do with our conversation.  Mr. Troy's&#10;course is not by any means downward; and his superiority IS a proof&#10;of his worth!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe him to have no conscience at all.

In recovering she struck against&#10;warm clothes and buttons.&#10;&#10;&quot;A rum start, upon my soul!&quot; said a masculine voice, a foot or so&#10;above her head.  &quot;Have I hurt you, mate?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said Bathsheba, attempting to shrink away.&#10;&#10;&quot;We have got hitched together somehow, I think.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you a woman?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A lady, I should have said.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a man.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that a dark lantern you have?  I fancy so,&quot; said the man.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you'll allow me I'll open it, and set you free.&quot;&#10;&#10;A hand seized the lantern, the door was opened, the rays burst&#10;out from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld her position with&#10;astonishment.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, there are several concerns regarding Sergeant Troy's character that suggest Bathsheba should avoid him. Firstly, Troy has a history of making negative comments about other men who pursue Bathsheba, as seen when he warns her against Boldwood. This behavior indicates a jealous and possessive nature. Secondly, Troy seems to manipulate Bathsheba's emotions by first admitting his attraction to her, then later encouraging her to meet him in secret with a sword, which she declines. His persistence in this matter demonstrates a lack of respect for Bathsheba's boundaries and decisions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Troy has been described as having an education and social standing higher than the other soldiers, yet he seems to be on a downward course. This could imply a lack of responsibility or self-control on his part. Moreover, the fact that Bathsheba initially hates him but later warms up to him, even against her own judgment, suggests that Troy may use his charm and charisma to influence Bathsheba's feelings and decisions.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Troy's sudden appearance at the exact moment when Bathsheba is alone and engaged in manual labor can be seen as suspicious and potentially dangerous. This behavior could indicate a pattern of stalking or an intent to put Bathsheba in a vulnerable position. For these reasons, it would be wise for Bathsheba to avoid Sergeant Troy and protect her well-being." />

By the time she&#10;reached the bottom Troy was there also, and he stooped to pick up&#10;the hive.&#10;&#10;&quot;How fortunate I am to have dropped in at this moment!&quot; exclaimed the&#10;sergeant.&#10;&#10;She found her voice in a minute.  &quot;What! and will you shake them in&#10;for me?&quot; she asked, in what, for a defiant girl, was a faltering way;&#10;though, for a timid girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will I!&quot; said Troy.  &quot;Why, of course I will.  How blooming you are&#10;to-day!&quot;  Troy flung down his cane" />
    <node id="Bathsheba, who is usually self-reliant and strong-willed, faces several struggles when she falls in love with Sergeant Troy and abandons her self-reliance. According to the narrative, one of the main sources of her inadequacy is the novelty of the situation, as she has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new. Furthermore, Troy's charm and charisma seem to influence Bathsheba's feelings and decisions, causing her to overlook his negative traits and manipulative behavior.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's lack of experience in romantic relationships also contributes to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy. She is not aware of how to handle his possessiveness and jealousy, especially when he warns her against Boldwood or later encourages her to meet him in secret with a sword. Additionally, she seems to be unaware of the potential dangers that could arise from Troy's sudden appearance and his behavior towards her.&#10;&#10;Another struggle Bathsheba faces is the difference between love and respect. While she had spoken freely about Boldwood and communed only with her own heart concerning Troy, this infatuation troubled Gabriel Oak as he saw Bathsheba getting into the toils of a potentially unhealthy relationship.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's struggles arise from her inexperience and the novelty of abandoning her self-reliance, making her vulnerable to Troy's charms and manipulations. This situation contradicts her usual strong and independent nature, leading to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy's behavior." />
    <node id=" Bathsheba, though she had too much&#10;understanding to be entirely governed by her womanliness, had too&#10;much womanliness to use her understanding to the best advantage.&#10;Perhaps in no minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more than&#10;in the strange power she possesses of believing cajoleries that she&#10;knows to be false--except, indeed, in that of being utterly sceptical&#10;on strictures that she knows to be true.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women&#10;love when they abandon their self-reliance.  When a strong woman&#10;recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman&#10;who has never had any strength to throw away.  One source of her&#10;inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She has never had practice&#10;in making the best of such a condition.  Weakness is doubly weak by&#10;being new.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter.

He had also kissed her a second time.&#10;&#10;It is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little fact which&#10;did not come to light till a long time afterwards: that Troy's&#10;presentation of himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was&#10;not by any distinctly preconcerted arrangement.

Bathsheba had spoken of her interest in Boldwood with the&#10;greatest freedom to Liddy, but she had only communed with her own&#10;heart concerning Troy.&#10;&#10;All this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled thereby from the&#10;time of his daily journey a-field to the time of his return, and on&#10;to the small hours of many a night.  That he was not beloved had&#10;hitherto been his great sorrow; that Bathsheba was getting into&#10;the toils was now a sorrow greater than the first, and one which&#10;nearly obscured it.  It was a result which paralleled the oft-quoted&#10;observation of Hippocrates concerning physical pains.&#10;&#10;That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the&#10;fear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter&#10;from" />

To be sure I am no stranger to the&#10;place--I am Sergeant Troy, as I told you, and I have assisted your&#10;uncle in these fields no end of times when I was a lad.  I have been&#10;doing the same for you to-day.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose I must thank you for that, Sergeant Troy,&quot; said the Queen&#10;of the Corn-market, in an indifferently grateful tone.&#10;&#10;The sergeant looked hurt and sad.  &quot;Indeed you must not, Miss&#10;Everdene,&quot; he said.  &quot;Why could you think such a thing necessary?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad" />

    <node id="Sergent Troy has a unique perspective on time, as he primarily focuses on the present moment without much thought for the past or future. He considers the past as merely &quot;yesterday&quot; and the future as &quot;to-morrow,&quot; never contemplating the &quot;day after.&quot; This outlook allows him to avoid disappointment, as he doesn't engage in expectations or reminiscence, but it may also limit his higher tastes and sensations. His lack of anticipation might make him more spontaneous and reactive to immediate circumstances, which could lead to both brilliant and potentially harmful actions." />

His outlook&#10;upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then: that&#10;projection of consciousness into days gone by and to come, which&#10;makes the past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word&#10;for circumspection, was foreign to Troy.  With him the past was&#10;yesterday; the future, to-morrow; never, the day after.&#10;&#10;On this account he might, in certain lights, have been regarded as&#10;one of the most fortunate of his order.  For it may be argued with&#10;great plausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a&#10;disease, and that expectation in its only comfortable form--that of&#10;absolute faith--is practically an impossibility; whilst in the form&#10;of hope and the secondary compounds, patience, impatience, resolve,&#10;curiosity, it is a constant fluctuation between pleasure and pain.&#10;&#10;Sergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the practice of&#10;expectation, was never disappointed.

This&#10;treatment had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other men's&#10;gallantries, to his own aggrandizement as a Corinthian, rather than&#10;to the moral profit of his hearers.&#10;&#10;His reason and his propensities had seldom any reciprocating&#10;influence, having separated by mutual consent long ago: thence it&#10;sometimes happened that, while his intentions were as honourable as&#10;could be wished, any particular deed formed a dark background which&#10;threw them into fine relief.  The sergeant's vicious phases being the&#10;offspring of impulse, and his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the&#10;latter had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than seen.&#10;&#10;Troy was full of activity, but his activities were less of a&#10;locomotive than a vegetative nature; and, never being based upon&#10;any original choice of foundation or direction, they were exercised&#10;on whatever object chance might place in their way.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is possible that Sergeant Troy is staying in the village on furlough and could be the man Bathsheba just encountered during her walk. Liddy, Bathsheba's servant, suggests this possibility, stating that Troy had been in the area before when his regiment was stationed at Casterbridge. The description of the soldier Bathsheba encounters matches Troy's physical appearance and military status, with a red coat and blue facings. However, the narrative does not provide explicit confirmation of Troy's presence in the village or his identity as the man Bathsheba met during her walk." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide any specific information or evidence about Sergeant Troy's character that would directly convince Bathsheba of his goodness and clear him of the accusations. Instead, Gabriel Oak expresses his concerns about Troy's character indirectly by implying that Troy is not good enough for Bathsheba and that she should avoid him.&#10;&#10;Oak's suggestion that Troy does not deserve Bathsheba's attention is based on his belief that Troy has no conscience and that his superiority in learning and birth only indicates a downward course in life. However, these arguments do not seem to persuade Bathsheba, who insists that Troy is an educated man and quite worthy of any woman.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is unlikely that Oak's indirect approach would be effective in convincing Bathsheba of Troy's goodness. To make Bathsheba believe that Troy cannot be bad, Oak would need to provide her with concrete evidence or specific examples that directly refute the accusations against Troy and demonstrate his good character." />

It may safely be asserted with respect to the closeness&#10;of his cuts, that had it been possible for the edge of the sword to&#10;leave in the air a permanent substance wherever it flew past, the&#10;space left untouched would have been almost a mould of Bathsheba's&#10;figure.&#10;&#10;Behind the luminous streams of this _aurora militaris_, she could see&#10;the hue of Troy's sword arm, spread in a scarlet haze over the space&#10;covered by its motions, like a twanged harpstring, and behind all&#10;Troy himself, mostly facing her; sometimes, to show" />

    <node id="In the narrative, there is no direct mention of Bathsheba helping Troy out of his beekeeper suit. However, based on the context of the story, it is possible that such an event may occur in the future, given Bathsheba's growing curiosity and attraction towards Troy.&#10;&#10;If Bathsheba were to help Troy out of his beekeeper suit, her reaction would likely be a mixture of embarrassment and curiosity. On the one hand, she may feel awkward or uncomfortable at the prospect of being so physically close to Troy, especially given their previous encounters and the potential danger he poses to her well-being. On the other hand, she may also feel intrigued by the experience, as it would provide her with an opportunity to learn more about Troy's world and the secrets that he holds.&#10;&#10;Regardless of Bathsheba's specific reaction, however, it is clear from the narrative that she should exercise caution when interacting with Troy, given his history of negative comments about other men who pursue her, manipulative behavior, and potentially dangerous tendencies. By remaining aware of these red flags and protecting herself accordingly, Bathsheba can make informed decisions about her relationship with Troy and avoid putting herself in harm's way." />

    <node id="The discussion between Bathsheba, Liddy, Maryann, and Temperance revolves around Sergeant Frank Troy, whom they believe Bathsheba may marry. The servants express concern that such a marriage would lead Bathsheba to give up farming and that Troy's gallant life might bring some trouble. They also mention rumors about Troy, but Bathsheba interrupts, insisting she does not care for him and hates him.&#10;&#10;The servants then reveal they all know she hates Troy, including Maryann, who admired him that very morning. Bathsheba reminds Maryann of her admiration for Troy, but Maryann argues that even though he is handsome and educated, his reputation as a 'wild scamp' makes him unworthy.&#10;&#10;In summary, the discussion involves expressing opinions about Sergeant Frank Troy's character and whether or not Bathsheba should consider marrying him." />
    <node id="Bathsheba Everdene's heartache is caused by her secret love for Sergeant Frank Troy, contradicting her earlier statement that she hates him and her denial of any feelings towards him. Despite her own concerns about his character as a 'wild scamp,' she asks Liddy to think of Troy as a good man because she wants to alleviate any potential negative opinions about him, which might negatively impact her chances with him or create unnecessary gossip. This shows Bathsheba's vulnerability and strong emotions for Troy, despite the fact that his reputation may not be worthy of her admiration or affection." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there is no information suggesting that Bathsheba has refused to forgive Sergeant Frank Troy. The text mentions that she hates him and later reveals her secret love for him, but it does not indicate any specific actions or events where Troy seeks forgiveness from Bathsheba. Therefore, without further context or details, it is impossible to accurately answer this question." />
    <node id="Bathsheba's approach to her feelings for Troy is characterized by her willingness to prioritize her emotions over careful consideration of consequences, as she immerses herself in the simple pleasures of rural life. The narrative describes her love as &quot;entire as a child's&quot; and &quot;fresh as spring,&quot; emphasizing its genuine and unguarded nature. Bathsheba does not concern herself with Troy's hidden flaws or seek subtle inquiry into potential consequences, which is symbolized by the pastoral setting of &quot;daylight coteries and green carpets.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this rustic world, her impulses take precedence over discretion, and she fails to recognize Troy's true character. While she sees his surface-level embellishments, Bathsheba overlooks his deeper flaws, which Oak attempts to point out indirectly. However, his approach does not seem effective in changing her perception of Troy or convincing her of his unworthiness. Overall, the narrative portrays Bathsheba as a passionate and impulsive character who is deeply connected to the simple charms of rural life, even at the cost of overlooking potential red flags in her relationships." />
    <node id=", it was, after all, that world of daylight&#10;coteries and green carpets wherein cattle form the passing crowd and&#10;winds the busy hum; where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives on&#10;the other side of your party-wall, where your neighbour is everybody&#10;in the tything, and where calculation is confined to market-days.&#10;Of the fabricated tastes of good fashionable society she knew but&#10;little, and of the formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all.&#10;Had her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded (and&#10;by herself they never were), they would only have amounted to such a&#10;matter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her&#10;discretion.  Her love was entire as a child's, and though warm as&#10;summer it was fresh as spring.  Her culpability lay in her making&#10;no attempt to control feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into&#10;consequences.  She could show others the steep and thorny way, but&#10;&quot;reck'd not her own rede.&quot;&#10;&#10;And Troy's deformities lay deep down from a woman's vision, whilst&#10;his embellishments were upon the very surface; thus contrasting with&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Troy's reputation as a Corinthian and his tendency to boast about other men's gallantries: The narrative suggests that Troy became a &quot;regrater of other men's gallantries&quot; to aggrandize himself, rather than promoting moral profit for his hearers. This behavior might be attributed to the fact that disapproval of his morals was often tempered with a smile, leading him to believe that such boasting was acceptable and even popular in society.&#10;&#10;2. Troy's impulsive vicious phases vs. virtuous phases from cool meditation: Troy's vicious phases are described as the offspring of impulse, while his virtuous phases are a result of cool meditation. This implies that his vicious actions, such as lying to women, are more spontaneous and instinctual, whereas his virtuous deeds stem from careful thought and consideration. However, since Troy's reason and propensities have separated long ago, his virtuous phases have a modest tendency to be heard of more than seen, suggesting that he may not always follow through on his good intentions.&#10;&#10;Troy's activities are described as having a vegetative nature, being exercised on whatever object chance might place in their way. This implies that Troy lacks direction and focus in his actions, often reacting to situations impulsively rather than making conscious choices based on a foundation or direction." />
    <node id=" there may have been some positive losses from a certain&#10;narrowing of the higher tastes and sensations which it entailed.  But&#10;limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss by the loser&#10;therefrom: in this attribute moral or aesthetic poverty contrasts&#10;plausibly with material, since those who suffer do not mind it,&#10;whilst those who mind it soon cease to suffer.  It is not a denial&#10;of anything to have been always without it, and what Troy had never&#10;enjoyed he did not miss; but, being fully conscious that what sober&#10;people missed he enjoyed, his capacity, though really less, seemed&#10;greater than theirs.&#10;&#10;He was moderately truthful towards men, but to women lied like&#10;a Cretan--a system of ethics above all others calculated to win&#10;popularity at the first flush of admission into lively society; and&#10;the possibility of the favour gained being transitory had reference&#10;only to the future.&#10;&#10;He never passed the line which divides the spruce vices from the&#10;ugly; and hence, though his morals had hardly been applauded,&#10;disapproval of them had frequently been tempered with a smile.

It was in&#10;the latter part of June, and the day after the interview with Troy in&#10;the hayfield, that Bathsheba was standing in her garden, watching a&#10;swarm in the air and guessing their probable settling place.  Not&#10;only were they late this year, but unruly.  Sometimes throughout a&#10;whole season all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable&#10;bough--such as part of a currant-bush or espalier apple-tree; next&#10;year they would, with just the same unanimity, make straight off to&#10;the uppermost member of some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden,&#10;and there defy all invaders who did not come armed with ladders and&#10;staves to take them.&#10;&#10;This was the case at present.

Slipping along here covertly&#10;as Time, Bathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps entering the&#10;track at the opposite end.  It was certainly a rustle of footsteps.&#10;Her own instantly fell as gently as snowflakes.  She reassured&#10;herself by a remembrance that the path was public, and that the&#10;traveller was probably some villager returning home; regretting,&#10;at the same time, that the meeting should be about to occur in the&#10;darkest point of her route, even though only just outside her own&#10;door.&#10;&#10;The noise approached, came close, and a figure was apparently on the&#10;point of gliding past her when something tugged at her skirt and&#10;pinned it forcibly to the ground.  The instantaneous check nearly&#10;threw Bathsheba off" />
    <node id="Bathsheba's defensiveness regarding Sergeant Troy's character and church attendance can be attributed to her strong and self-reliant personality, as well as her attraction to him. Even though she understands that Troy may not be a good match for her and is aware of his flaws, she has fallen in love with him and sets aside her better judgment. As a result, she becomes overly sensitive to any criticism or negative comments about him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Bathsheba's defensiveness can also stem from the fact that Troy represents a departure from her usual type of man and social circle. She is used to being independent and in control, but Troy challenges this by drawing her attention and affection towards him. Therefore, she feels the need to defend him to maintain her own self-image as someone who can make her own decisions, even if they may not be the best ones.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's background as a farmer and her familiarity with the natural world contribute to her skepticism towards criticisms of others, making it difficult for her to accept Oak's concerns about Troy's character. Her strong will and self-confidence make it challenging for anyone to persuade her otherwise.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's defensiveness towards Troy is a complex mix of her attraction to him, her desire to maintain her independence, and her skepticism towards criticisms that she knows to be true but finds difficult to accept." />
    <node id="GINA'S ANSWER:&#10;Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy stems from his belief that Troy is not a suitable match for her, as opposed to Farmer Boldwood, who he sees as a better candidate. This contrast is based on Oak's understanding of both men's characters and his indirect attempts to persuade Bathsheba of Troy's unworthiness.&#10;&#10;Oak's concerns about Troy are rooted in his belief that the sergeant lacks a conscience and has a downward course in life, despite his apparent superiority in learning and birth. Oak tries to convey this to Bathsheba indirectly but fails to change her perception of Troy. In contrast, Oak sees Boldwood as a more respectable and eligible bachelor for Bathsheba, given his successful farm and genuine affection for her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's self-reliant and strong-willed nature is well known to Oak, who values her independence and intelligence. He does not wish to impose his own feelings on her or make her feel indebted to him; instead, he aims to act in the best interest of the farm and its owner. This sense of responsibility towards Bathsheba and the farm drives Oak's concerns about her relationship with Troy, as he recognizes the potential dangers and negative traits that Troy possesses.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy is primarily motivated by his belief in Troy's unworthiness and his responsibility to protect Bathsheba's well-being, rather than his own unrequited love for her. The contrast between Oak and Boldwood's affection for Bathsheba further highlights Oak's concerns about Troy's character and suitability as a partner for her." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba does not undergo a transformation as a result of Troy's swordplay. While the text mentions that Troy's skillful display of cuts and thrusts creates an impression of lights and sounds appearing to come from all around Bathsheba, there is no indication that this spectacle has any transformative effect on her. Instead, the narrative focuses on Bathsheba's curiosity, intrigue, and growing attraction towards Troy, which lead her to agree to meet him in the uncultivated tract of land filled with brake ferns. However, there is no direct connection drawn between Troy's swordplay and any transformation experienced by Bathsheba." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide sufficient information about the reasons behind Sergeant Frank Troy's sudden and enduring love for Bathsheba. It is possible that Troy falls in love with her due to her beauty, intelligence, or independence, but these motivations are not explicitly stated in the text.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba finds his claim of love unbelievable because she has heard rumors about Troy's reputation as a 'wild scamp' and knows that he has been involved with several women in the past. She may also be skeptical of his sincerity, especially since their interactions have been limited and they do not know each other well. Additionally, Bathsheba herself has mixed feelings about Troy, alternating between hating him and having secret love for him, which could contribute to her difficulty in fully believing or trusting his declaration of love." />
    <node id="Bathsheba Everdene's distress and conflicting emotions are caused by her secret love for Sergeant Frank Troy. She has previously stated that she hates him and denied any feelings towards him, but in this narrative, it becomes clear that she actually loves him deeply. This contradiction creates inner turmoil for Bathsheba, as she struggles to come to terms with her true feelings while also being concerned about Troy's questionable character and the potential negative opinions and gossip that might arise from her affection for him.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba makes Liddy promise not to repeat what she says because she is aware of the potential consequences of sharing her secret love for Troy. Gossip can be damaging, especially in a small community where people are quick to judge and form opinions based on rumors. By asking Liddy to keep her secret, Bathsheba hopes to protect herself from unwanted attention and maintain some level of privacy regarding her personal feelings. Additionally, by ensuring that Liddy thinks well of Troy, she aims to create a more positive environment for herself and potentially influence others' perceptions of him as well." />

    <node id="Bathsheba is hiving bees by herself while everyone else is busy saving hay because the other workers, including Liddy, have left their tasks to help with the hay. She has put on protective gear and climbed up a ladder to dress the hive with herbs and honey.&#10;&#10;The &quot;strange power&quot; beginning to manifest from a voice heard nearby refers to the growing attraction and fascination that Bathsheba feels towards Sergeant Troy. This voice belongs to Troy, who is nearby and has been displaying his swordsmanship skills. The narrative suggests that Bathsheba is becoming more and more captivated by Troy's charm and confidence, even though she initially finds his behavior disruptive and distracting." />

A process somewhat analogous to that of alleged&#10;formations of the universe, time and times ago, was observable.  The&#10;bustling swarm had swept the sky in a scattered and uniform haze,&#10;which now thickened to a nebulous centre: this glided on to a bough&#10;and grew still denser, till it formed a solid black spot upon the&#10;light.&#10;&#10;The men and women being all busily engaged in saving the hay--even&#10;Liddy had left the house for the purpose of lending a hand--Bathsheba&#10;resolved to hive the bees herself, if possible.  She had dressed the&#10;hive with herbs and honey, fetched a ladder, brush, and crook, made&#10;herself impregnable with armour of leather gloves, straw hat, and&#10;large gauze veil--once green but now faded to snuff colour--and&#10;ascended a dozen rungs of the ladder.  At once she heard, not ten&#10;yards off, a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in&#10;ag" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba has a respectful relationship with Farmer Boldwood but does not have romantic feelings for him. She acknowledges that she has given him no definite answer regarding his marriage proposal and intends to decline when he returns.&#10;&#10;Regarding Sergeant Troy, Bathsheba initially dislikes him, but her feelings change over time, leading to a secret love for him. However, she is aware of the negative comments made about their relationship, including trifling accusations. She denies these claims and emphasizes that she doesn't &quot;trifle&quot; with Troy but also states that she has nothing to do with him.&#10;&#10;Despite her growing feelings for Troy, Bathsheba should be cautious due to his negative character traits, such as jealousy, manipulation, potential downward spiral in life, and disregard for her boundaries. Additionally, Troy's sudden appearance when she is alone and engaged in manual labor can be seen as suspicious behavior.&#10;&#10;Gabriel Oak has concerns about Bathsheba's relationship with Troy due to these negative traits and tries to indirectly persuade her that Troy is not a suitable match. He sees Boldwood as a more respectable bachelor and values Bathsheba's independence, not wishing to impose his own feelings on her. However, Oak's indirect approach might not be effective in convincing Bathsheba of Troy's unworthiness without concrete evidence or specific examples that directly refute the accusations against him." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there is no explicit explanation given as to how Troy managed to remove a thin shaving from his hand using a sword that he previously claimed was blunt. It is possible that Troy was exaggerating or lying about the sword being completely blunt in order to impress Bathsheba with his skill and fearlessness. Alternatively, he may have discovered a very small sharp edge on the blade that was capable of shaving his skin but not cutting it deeply.&#10;&#10;Regarding the safety of Bathsheba during their encounter, the narrative suggests that Troy is an experienced swordsman who handles the weapon with ease and confidence. However, his skillful swordplay also involves a certain level of danger, as demonstrated by his ability to remove a thin shaving from his hand. This raises concerns about the safety of Bathsheba, who is not a trained swordsman and may be at risk of injury during their encounter.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Troy's behavior throughout the scene suggests that he is more concerned with impressing Bathsheba and showcasing his skills than ensuring her safety. For example, he deliberately creates a spectacle of lights and sounds to dazzle her, rather than focusing on teaching her the cuts and thrusts in a safe and controlled manner.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Troy's swordplay may be impressive and entertaining, it also poses a potential risk to Bathsheba's safety, particularly given his questionable honesty about the sharpness of the blade." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, I have several concerns about Sergeant Troy's character that would suggest Bathsheba should avoid having anything to do with him. First, Troy has a reputation as a 'wild scamp,' which implies that he is reckless and irresponsible. This is further supported by the servants' belief that his gallant life might bring some trouble between the mirth if he were to marry Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are rumors about Troy, although the narrative does not provide specific details about these rumors. However, even without knowing the exact nature of the rumors, they still contribute to my concern about his character.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Gabriel Oak expresses his concerns about Troy's character indirectly by suggesting that Troy is not good enough for Bathsheba and that she should avoid him. Oak argues that Troy has no conscience and that his superiority in learning and birth only indicates a downward course in life.&#10;&#10;While these concerns may not be sufficient to convince Bathsheba of Troy's bad character directly, they do provide valid reasons for her to exercise caution and consider whether Troy is the right person for her to marry or have a relationship with. Without further evidence or specific examples that demonstrate Troy's goodness, it is reasonable to advise Bathsheba to avoid having anything to do with him." />

Firstly, Troy has a history of making negative comments about other men who pursue Bathsheba, as seen when he warns her against Boldwood. This behavior indicates a jealous and possessive nature. Secondly, Troy seems to manipulate Bathsheba's emotions by first admitting his attraction to her, then later encouraging her to meet him in secret with a sword, which she declines. His persistence in this matter demonstrates a lack of respect for Bathsheba's boundaries and decisions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Troy has been described as having an education and social standing higher than the other soldiers, yet he seems to be on a downward course. This could imply a lack of responsibility or self-control on his part. Moreover, the fact that Bathsheba initially hates him but later warms up to him, even against her own judgment, suggests that Troy may use his charm and charisma to influence Bathsheba's feelings and decisions.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Troy's sudden appearance at the exact moment when Bathsheba is alone and engaged in manual labor can be seen as suspicious and potentially dangerous. This behavior could indicate a pattern of stalking or an intent to put Bathsheba in a vulnerable position.

However, it is revealed later in the narrative that Bathsheba informs Oak that no such wedding is likely to occur between them, and Oak shares his observation that Boldwood's behavior indicates that he is indeed courting her." target="Bathsheba, who is usually self-reliant and strong-willed, faces several struggles when she falls in love with Sergeant Troy and abandons her self-reliance. According to the narrative, one of the main sources of her inadequacy is the novelty of the situation, as she has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new. Furthermore, Troy's charm and charisma seem to influence Bathsheba's feelings and decisions, causing her to overlook his negative traits and manipulative behavior.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's lack of experience in romantic relationships also contributes to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy. She is not aware of how to handle his possessiveness and jealousy, especially when he warns her against Boldwood or later encourages her to meet him in secret with a sword. Additionally, she seems to be unaware of the potential dangers that could arise from Troy's sudden appearance and his behavior towards her.&#10;&#10;Another struggle Bathsheba faces is the difference between love and respect. While she had spoken freely about Boldwood and communed only with her own heart concerning Troy, this infatuation troubled Gabriel Oak as he saw Bathsheba getting into the toils of a potentially unhealthy relationship.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's struggles arise from her inexperience and the novelty of abandoning her self-reliance, making her vulnerable to Troy's charms and manipulations. This situation contradicts her usual strong and independent nature, leading to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy's behavior.">

As a result, she becomes overly sensitive to any criticism or negative comments about him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Bathsheba's defensiveness can also stem from the fact that Troy represents a departure from her usual type of man and social circle. She is used to being independent and in control, but Troy challenges this by drawing her attention and affection towards him. Therefore, she feels the need to defend him to maintain her own self-image as someone who can make her own decisions, even if they may not be the best ones.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's background as a farmer and her familiarity with the natural world contribute to her skepticism towards criticisms of others, making it difficult for her to accept Oak's concerns about Troy's character.

This contrast is based on Oak's understanding of both men's characters and his indirect attempts to persuade Bathsheba of Troy's unworthiness.&#10;&#10;Oak's concerns about Troy are rooted in his belief that the sergeant lacks a conscience and has a downward course in life, despite his apparent superiority in learning and birth.

In contrast, Oak sees Boldwood as a more respectable and eligible bachelor for Bathsheba, given his successful farm and genuine affection for her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's self-reliant and strong-willed nature is well known to Oak, who values her independence and intelligence. He does not wish to impose his own feelings on her or make her feel indebted to him; instead, he aims to act in the best interest of the farm and its owner. This sense of responsibility towards Bathsheba and the farm drives Oak's concerns about her relationship with Troy, as he recognizes the potential dangers and negative traits that Troy possesses.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy is primarily motivated by his belief in Troy's unworthiness and his responsibility to protect Bathsheba's well-being, rather than his own unrequited love for her.

The narrative suggests that Bathsheba is becoming more and more captivated by Troy's charm and confidence, even though she initially finds his behavior disruptive and distracting.">

According to the narrative, one of the main sources of her inadequacy is the novelty of the situation, as she has never had practice in making the best of such a condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new. Furthermore, Troy's charm and charisma seem to influence Bathsheba's feelings and decisions, causing her to overlook his negative traits and manipulative behavior.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's lack of experience in romantic relationships also contributes to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy. She is not aware of how to handle his possessiveness and jealousy, especially when he warns her against Boldwood or later encourages her to meet him in secret with a sword. Additionally, she seems to be unaware of the potential dangers that could arise from Troy's sudden appearance and his behavior towards her.&#10;&#10;Another struggle Bathsheba faces is the difference between love and respect. While she had spoken freely about Boldwood and communed only with her own heart concerning Troy, this infatuation troubled Gabriel Oak as he saw Bathsheba getting into the toils of a potentially unhealthy relationship.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's struggles arise from her inexperience and the novelty of abandoning her self-reliance, making her vulnerable to Troy's charms and manipulations.

Oak argues that Troy has no conscience and that his superiority in learning and birth only indicates a downward course in life.&#10;&#10;While these concerns may not be sufficient to convince Bathsheba of Troy's bad character directly, they do provide valid reasons for her to exercise caution and consider whether Troy is the right person for her to marry or have a relationship with.

Weakness is doubly weak by being new. Furthermore, Troy's charm and charisma seem to influence Bathsheba's feelings and decisions, causing her to overlook his negative traits and manipulative behavior.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's lack of experience in romantic relationships also contributes to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy.

This situation contradicts her usual strong and independent nature, leading to her inadequacy when dealing with Troy's behavior." target="GINA'S ANSWER:&#10;Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy stems from his belief that Troy is not a suitable match for her, as opposed to Farmer Boldwood, who he sees as a better candidate. This contrast is based on Oak's understanding of both men's characters and his indirect attempts to persuade Bathsheba of Troy's unworthiness.&#10;&#10;Oak's concerns about Troy are rooted in his belief that the sergeant lacks a conscience and has a downward course in life, despite his apparent superiority in learning and birth. Oak tries to convey this to Bathsheba indirectly but fails to change her perception of Troy. In contrast, Oak sees Boldwood as a more respectable and eligible bachelor for Bathsheba, given his successful farm and genuine affection for her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's self-reliant and strong-willed nature is well known to Oak, who values her independence and intelligence. He does not wish to impose his own feelings on her or make her feel indebted to him; instead, he aims to act in the best interest of the farm and its owner. This sense of responsibility towards Bathsheba and the farm drives Oak's concerns about her relationship with Troy, as he recognizes the potential dangers and negative traits that Troy possesses.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy is primarily motivated by his belief in Troy's unworthiness and his responsibility to protect Bathsheba's well-being, rather than his own unrequited love for her. The contrast between Oak and Boldwood's affection for Bathsheba further highlights Oak's concerns about Troy's character and suitability as a partner for her.">

Even though she understands that Troy may not be a good match for her and is aware of his flaws, she has fallen in love with him and sets aside her better judgment. As a result, she becomes overly sensitive to any criticism or negative comments about him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Bathsheba's defensiveness can also stem from the fact that Troy represents a departure from her usual type of man and social circle. She is used to being independent and in control, but Troy challenges this by drawing her attention and affection towards him. Therefore, she feels the need to defend him to maintain her own self-image as someone who can make her own decisions, even if they may not be the best ones.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's background as a farmer and her familiarity with the natural world contribute to her skepticism towards criticisms of others, making it difficult for her to accept Oak's concerns about Troy's character. Her strong will and self-confidence make it challenging for anyone to persuade her otherwise.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's defensiveness towards Troy is a complex mix of her attraction to him, her desire to maintain her independence, and her skepticism towards criticisms that she knows to be true but finds difficult to accept.">

This contrast is based on Oak's understanding of both men's characters and his indirect attempts to persuade Bathsheba of Troy's unworthiness.&#10;&#10;Oak's concerns about Troy are rooted in his belief that the sergeant lacks a conscience and has a downward course in life, despite his apparent superiority in learning and birth.

He does not wish to impose his own feelings on her or make her feel indebted to him; instead, he aims to act in the best interest of the farm and its owner. This sense of responsibility towards Bathsheba and the farm drives Oak's concerns about her relationship with Troy, as he recognizes the potential dangers and negative traits that Troy possesses.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy is primarily motivated by his belief in Troy's unworthiness and his responsibility to protect Bathsheba's well-being, rather than his own unrequited love for her. The contrast between Oak and Boldwood's affection for Bathsheba further highlights Oak's concerns about Troy's character and suitability as a partner for her.">

This behavior might be attributed to the fact that disapproval of his morals was often tempered with a smile, leading him to believe that such boasting was acceptable and even popular in society.&#10;&#10;2. Troy's impulsive vicious phases vs. virtuous phases from cool meditation: Troy's vicious phases are described as the offspring of impulse, while his virtuous phases are a result of cool meditation. This implies that his vicious actions, such as lying to women, are more spontaneous and instinctual, whereas his virtuous deeds stem from careful thought and consideration. However, since Troy's reason and propensities have separated long ago, his virtuous phases have a modest tendency to be heard of more than seen, suggesting that he may not always follow through on his good intentions.&#10;&#10;Troy's activities are described as having a vegetative nature, being exercised on whatever object chance might place in their way.

This contrast is based on Oak's understanding of both men's characters and his indirect attempts to persuade Bathsheba of Troy's unworthiness.&#10;&#10;Oak's concerns about Troy are rooted in his belief that the sergeant lacks a conscience and has a downward course in life, despite his apparent superiority in learning and birth. Oak tries to convey this to Bathsheba indirectly but fails to change her perception of Troy. In contrast, Oak sees Boldwood as a more respectable and eligible bachelor for Bathsheba, given his successful farm and genuine affection for her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's self-reliant and strong-willed nature is well known to Oak, who values her independence and intelligence. He does not wish to impose his own feelings on her or make her feel indebted to him; instead, he aims to act in the best interest of the farm and its owner. This sense of responsibility towards Bathsheba and the farm drives Oak's concerns about her relationship with Troy, as he recognizes the potential dangers and negative traits that Troy possesses.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel Oak's growing concern about Bathsheba's relationship with Sergeant Troy is primarily motivated by his belief in Troy's unworthiness and his responsibility to protect Bathsheba's well-being, rather than his own unrequited love for her. The contrast between Oak and Boldwood's affection for Bathsheba further highlights Oak's concerns about Troy's character and suitability as a partner for her.">

This raises concerns about the safety of Bathsheba, who is not a trained swordsman and may be at risk of injury during their encounter.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Troy's behavior throughout the scene suggests that he is more concerned with impressing Bathsheba and showcasing his skills than ensuring her safety. For example, he deliberately creates a spectacle of lights and sounds to dazzle her, rather than focusing on teaching her the cuts and thrusts in a safe and controlled manner.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Troy's swordplay may be impressive and entertaining, it also poses a potential risk to Bathsheba's safety, particularly given his questionable honesty about the sharpness of the blade.">

First, Troy has a reputation as a 'wild scamp,' which implies that he is reckless and irresponsible. This is further supported by the servants' belief that his gallant life might bring some trouble between the mirth if he were to marry Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are rumors about Troy, although the narrative does not provide specific details about these rumors. However, even without knowing the exact nature of the rumors, they still contribute to my concern about his character.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Gabriel Oak expresses his concerns about Troy's character indirectly by suggesting that Troy is not good enough for Bathsheba and that she should avoid him. Oak argues that Troy has no conscience and that his superiority in learning and birth only indicates a downward course in life.&#10;&#10;While these concerns may not be sufficient to convince Bathsheba of Troy's bad character directly, they do provide valid reasons for her to exercise caution and consider whether Troy is the right person for her to marry or have a relationship with. Without further evidence or specific examples that demonstrate Troy's goodness, it is reasonable to advise Bathsheba to avoid having anything to do with him.">

    <edge source="1. Troy's reputation as a Corinthian and his tendency to boast about other men's gallantries: The narrative suggests that Troy became a &quot;regrater of other men's gallantries&quot; to aggrandize himself, rather than promoting moral profit for his hearers. This behavior might be attributed to the fact that disapproval of his morals was often tempered with a smile, leading him to believe that such boasting was acceptable and even popular in society.&#10;&#10;2. Troy's impulsive vicious phases vs. virtuous phases from cool meditation: Troy's vicious phases are described as the offspring of impulse, while his virtuous phases are a result of cool meditation. This implies that his vicious actions, such as lying to women, are more spontaneous and instinctual, whereas his virtuous deeds stem from careful thought and consideration. However, since Troy's reason and propensities have separated long ago, his virtuous phases have a modest tendency to be heard of more than seen, suggesting that he may not always follow through on his good intentions.&#10;&#10;Troy's activities are described as having a vegetative nature, being exercised on whatever object chance might place in their way.

    <node id="1. Retaliation from the Venusian natives: The Venusian natives are described as dangerous and untrustworthy. If they are responsible for the disappearance of a delegation member, it could lead to retaliation from the Earth-ship, increasing tensions and conflicts between the two groups.&#10;&#10;2. Deterioration of negotiations: The purpose of the delegation's visit to Venus is to negotiate with the natives and establish peaceful relations. If a member goes missing, it could jeopardize the progress made during the negotiations and make further discussions more challenging.&#10;&#10;3. Risk to the remaining delegation members: If one member has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, the safety of the other delegates could be at risk as well. The natives may view the delegation with suspicion and hostility, putting the remaining members in danger.&#10;&#10;4. Difficulty in navigating and identifying threats: Venus is described as having low visibility due to a vast cloud layer, making it difficult for the Earth-ship's crew to see potential dangers or identify the source of any threats. This could make it more challenging to locate the missing delegation member and protect the rest of the group.&#10;&#10;5. Possible escalation of the rebellion: The story mentions that a revolt is brewing on Venus, led by the descendants of the first Earthmen to land. The disappearance of a delegation member could be seen as an act of aggression, further fueling the rebellion and potentially leading to more violent confrontations." />
    <node id=" while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be no trace.&#10; &#10; Svan strode back to the car. &quot;Hurry up,&quot; he gasped to the girl. &quot;Now there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep a watch for other guards.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Venus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer. Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.&#10; &#10; &quot;Can't see a thing,&quot; he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away at the computer's table. &quot;Look—are those lights over there?&quot;&#10; &#10; The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. &quot;Probably the guards. Of course, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no answer in his stolid face. &quot;Don't joke about it,&quot; he said. &quot;Suppose something happens to the delegation?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then we're in the soup,&quot; the Exec said philosophically. &quot;I told you the natives were dangerous.

I don't trust the natives.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lowry lifted his eyebrows. &quot;Oh? But after all, they're human beings, just like us—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't even look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don't like them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Acclimation,&quot; Lowry said scientifically. &quot;They had to acclimate themselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the outskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present Venusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from the Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned proton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing wonderingly at the great ship, but" />

A few natives were gazing wonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of guards.&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; Lowry said suddenly, &quot;there's a minority who are afraid of us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives. They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we know Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground group that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the native Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that is—right down into the mud. Well—&quot; he laughed—&quot;maybe they will. After all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of—&quot;&#10; &#10; The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic voice rasped: &quot;Officer of the Deck! Post Number One!

They've been prohibited for the last three hundred years.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It isn't all the natives,&quot; Lowry said. &quot;Look how they've doubled the guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they know how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's this secret group they call the Council.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it?&quot; the Exec retorted. &quot;They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's gone out now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to be coming from the town, anyhow....&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed. Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been two bombs in the compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with" />

There was no reason why everything shouldn't have been functioning perfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the same. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open lock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town.

Perhaps there will be trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan laughed harshly. &quot; They don't think so. You heard them. We are not human any more. The officer said it.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other woman spoke unexpectedly. &quot;The Council was right,&quot; she agreed. &quot;Svan, what must we do?&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. &quot;One moment. Ingra, do you still object?&quot;&#10; &#10; The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly convinced by Svan.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;I do not object.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And the rest of us? Does any of us object?&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of assent.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good,&quot; said Svan. &quot;Then we must act. The Council has told us that we alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the Earth-ship returns, it means disaster" />
    <node id="1. Svan is waiting by the road because he is planning to infiltrate the Earth-ship. He knows that the sentries on the ship will be more difficult to overcome than the natives, so he plans to use deceit to gain access to the ship. He has calculated that he has about three minutes to wait for his chance.&#10;2. Once Svan reaches the Earth-ship, he plans to plant a bomb inside it. He has a pouch in his belt containing a slip of paper with the name of the person who drew the first cross and was a coward. He wonders if it could be Ingra or one of the men.&#10;3. Svan is not sure about Ingra's loyalty, and he fears that she might have informed someone about their plan. That's why he becomes paranoid when he hears a ground car racing towards him, and he tells Ingra to go away when she warns him about the Earthmen who are coming after them.&#10;4. Svan plans to use the bomb as a means of preventing the Earth-ship from returning to Earth. He knows that the atomite in the bomb will obliterate everyone on board, but he convinces himself that they won't feel any pain and won't know what happened." />

Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?&#10; &#10; There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.&#10; &#10; He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by its own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circling figures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own. They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the side of the ship.&#10; &#10; Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance. He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned" />
    <node id=". No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember, you are in no danger from the guards.&quot;&#10;  From the guards , his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a ground-shaking crash.&#10; &#10; Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting off the seconds. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; he ordered. &quot;I will wait here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Svan.&quot; The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached for him, kissed him. &quot;Good luck to you, Svan,&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good luck,&quot; repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around, sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.&#10; &#10; Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean? Was it" />
    <node id=" the ship.&#10; &#10; Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance. He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car was racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.&#10; &#10; Paralyzed, he heard the girl's voice. &quot;Svan! They're coming! They found the guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan, with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came for you. We must flee!&quot;&#10; &#10; He stared unseeingly at the light. &quot;Go away!&quot; he croaked unbelievingly. Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb in the car—&#10; &#10; &quot;Go away!&quot; he shrieked," />

Therefore, it must not return.&quot;&#10; &#10; An old man shifted restlessly. &quot;But they are strong, Svan,&quot; he complained. &quot;They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan nodded. &quot;No. They will leave. But they will never get back to Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never get back to Earth?&quot; the old man gasped. &quot;Has the Council authorized—murder?&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan shrugged. &quot;The Council did not know what we would face. The Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the Earth-ship has.&quot; He paused dangerously. &quot;Toller,&quot; he said, &quot;do you object?&quot;&#10; &#10; Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was dull. &quot;What is your plan?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his feet, held up a shiny metal globe. &quot;One of us will plant this in the ship. It will be set by means of this dial" />
    <node id=" &quot;Let's get this done with.&quot;&#10; &#10; She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite dark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them, illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.&#10; &#10; A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence that followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: &quot;Halt!&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where are you going?&quot; he growled.&#10; &#10; Svan spoke up. &quot;We want to look at the Earth-ship,&quot; he said. He opened the" />
    <node id="Ingra's kiss before she drives away could signify several things. It might indicate her affection for Svan, gratitude, or even a romantic feeling towards him. However, given the context of the story, it is also possible that she knows this could be a dangerous mission and is saying goodbye, or expressing hope that they will meet again if everything goes well.&#10;&#10;As for Svan's reactions or thoughts about it, he seems surprised by the kiss at first, as indicated by his statement &quot;The kiss had surprised him.&quot; He might be confused by her gesture, especially since he is focused on his mission and the danger they are all in. Alternatively, he could interpret it as a sign of support or encouragement from Ingra, which might boost his morale. However, Svan quickly moves on from the kiss and focuses on his plan to plant the bomb. Therefore, while the kiss may have some emotional significance for him, it does not seem to affect his determination to carry out his mission." />
    <node id=" palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in secret. His voice was very tired as he said, &quot;I will plant the bomb.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The six conspirators in Svan's old ground car moved slowly along the main street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except for deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the entrance to the town's Hall of Justice.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good,&quot; said Svan, observing them. &quot;The delegation is still here. We have ample time.&quot;&#10; &#10; He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered. Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?&#10; &#10; The right answer leaped up at him. They all are , he thought. Not one of them understands what this means. They're afraid.&#10; &#10; &#10; He clamped his lips. &quot;Go faster, Ingra,&quot; he ordered the girl who was driving. &quot;Let's get this done with.&quot;&#10; &#10; She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her eyes. Silently she nodded," />
    <node id="1. Ingra: She does not object to the plan but seems reluctant and uneasy. However, she eventually agrees to go along with it. Her kiss on Svan's cheek before leaving suggests that she may have some feelings for him or is showing gratitude.&#10;2. The old man, Toller: He initially expresses concern about the Council authorizing &quot;murder&quot; but quickly backs down when Svan becomes dangerous. He asks about Svan's plan and appears worried but compliant.&#10;3. The others: There is no specific description of their reactions, but they all unanimously agree to go along with Svan's plan, despite the danger it poses. They are likely anxious and unsure, but ultimately convinced by Svan's leadership." />

It will be set by means of this dial—&quot; he touched a spot on the surface of the globe with a pallid finger—&quot;to do nothing for forty hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.&quot;&#10; &#10; He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty, irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a mark on one of them, held it up.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will let chance decide who is to do the work,&quot; he said angrily. &quot;Is there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....&quot;&#10; &#10; No answer. Svan jerked his head. &quot;Good,&quot; he said. &quot;Ingra, bring me that bowl.&quot;&#10; &#10; Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm of her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan," />
    <node id="The man that Lowry and the surgeon encountered was Svan, a member of the Venusian delegation. It is revealed at the end of the story that Svan was part of a group called the Council, which opposed the arrival of colonists from Earth. Svan had a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb in his possession, and it is implied that he planned to use it to harm the Earth delegation. However, before he could do so, another bomb that was in the car he arrived in exploded. The explosion severely injured Svan and killed the other person in the car, and Svan died shortly after from his injuries. Lowry discovered the remains of the atomite bomb that Svan had been holding, which further confirmed the Council's hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation." />
    <node id=", delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car, and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Amazing,&quot; the surgeon said dryly. &quot;Well, they won't do any bombing now.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered. The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.&#10; &#10; &quot;Better them than us,&quot; he said. &quot;It's poetic justice if I ever saw it. They had it coming....&quot; He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of paper between his fingers. &quot;This is the only part I don't get,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's that?&quot; Lowry craned his neck. &quot;A piece of paper with a cross on it? What about it?&quot;&#10; &#10; The surgeon shrugged. &quot;He had it clenched in his hand,&quot; he said. &quot;Had the devil of a time getting it loose from him.&quot; He turned it over slowly, displayed the other side. &quot;Now what in the world would he be doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?&quot;" />
    <node id=" Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb in the car—&#10; &#10; &quot;Go away!&quot; he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....&#10; &#10; The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. &quot;He's still alive,&quot; he said callously to Lowry, who had just come up. &quot;It won't last long, though. What've you got there?&quot;&#10; &#10; Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a connection had been broken. &quot;He had a bomb,&quot; he said. &quot;A magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car, and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.&quot;&#10;" />

He snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.&#10;&quot;Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!&quot; But even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly and went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.&#10; &#10; The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, &quot;You see!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;You see?&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five others in the room looked apprehensive. &quot;You see?&quot; Svan repeated. &quot;From their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.&quot;&#10; &#10; The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her head. &quot;Svan, I'm afraid,&quot; she said. &quot;Who are we to decide if this is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are" />
    <node id="1. Svan's plan involves all six of them going to see the Earth-ship in his ground car, as a ruse to get close to the ship. One of them (Svan himself) will then get out at a good point and hide, while the other five return in the car which will have an apparent malfunction, such as running off the road or sinking in the swamp, to create a commotion and distract the guards. This will provide cover for Svan to approach the ship undetected and plant the bomb that he has with him. The bomb is magnetic and will not be noticed in the dark, allowing Svan to attach it to the ship before takeoff. The ship's occupants will not suspect anything because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space." />
    <node id=" compartment, none of the others noticed. Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been two bombs in the compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one.&#10; &#10; He got out of the car, holding the sphere. &quot;This will do for me,&quot; he said. &quot;They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. &quot;We must circle back again,&quot; she parroted. &quot;We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.&quot;&#10; &#10; Svan, listening, thought: It's not much of a plan. The guards would not be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. If they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a purpose.&#10; &#10; &#10; Aloud, he said, &quot;You understand. If I get through, I will return to the city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember, you are in" />

He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it with his hand, offered it to the girl. &quot;You first, Ingra,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their slips.&#10; &#10; Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.&#10;&quot;This is the plan,&quot; he said. &quot;We will go, all six of us, in my ground car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation. The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The guards" />
    <node id=" The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough, after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.&quot;&#10; &#10; There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: &quot;Look at the slips!&quot;&#10; &#10; Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled. Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over, striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....&#10; &#10; And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance. Almost he was disappointed.&#10; &#10; Each of the others had" />
    <node id="1. According to Svan's plan, Ingra and the others are tasked with distracting the sentries on the Earth-ship while he plants a bomb inside it. They will do this by creating a commotion near the ship, which will draw the guards away from their posts and give Svan an opportunity to sneak aboard undetected.&#10;2. Svan is not very confident in Ingra and the others' ability to follow through with the plan. He suspects that one of them may have informed someone about their plan and becomes paranoid when he hears a ground car racing towards him. When Ingra warns him about the Earthmen who are coming after them, Svan tells her to go away, indicating that he does not fully trust her.&#10;3. Despite his doubts, Svan still relies on Ingra and the others to create the necessary diversion for his plan to succeed. He knows that their actions will be crucial in allowing him to plant the bomb without being caught. Therefore, while he may not have complete faith in their abilities, he is still relying on them to play their part in the plan." />
    <node id="1. Svan is contemplating deceit because he knows that the sentries on the Earth-ship are better equipped and will not be as easily overcome as the natives. He cannot force the Earthmen to stay, so he plans to use deceit to get to the side of the ship.&#10;2. Near the Earth-ship, the ground is rising and the jungle plants are thinning out, indicating that Svan is approaching a clearing where the ship has landed. The sentries with slim-shafted blasters that he sees are guarding the ship and would not be easily overcome, making deceit the best option for Svan to get on board undetected." />

    <node id="Based on the story, the status of everything onboard the ship (aside from the missing delegation) is that all systems are functioning properly, cargo has been stowed away, and drivers are ready to lift off as soon as the delegation returns. The Executive Officer might be concerned about their return because he doesn't trust the natives, suspecting they could pose a threat to the delegation. Additionally, there's no way to see what's happening outside the ship due to Venus's thick cloud cover and lack of moon or stars, increasing the uncertainty surrounding the delegation's safety." />
    <node id="1. The situation when Svan and his companion are stopped by a Venusian State Guard while traveling on a jungle road involves them being questioned about their purpose for wanting to see the Earth-ship. They claim that they are representatives of the Council, which opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth, but do not disclose their true intentions.&#10;2. Their purpose for wanting to see the Earth-ship is part of Svan's plan to plant a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship. He intends to use deceit to get close to the ship and attach the bomb before takeoff, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. This is part of the Council's plan to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus, even if it means using violent means.&#10;3. Svan's companion, who is also a member of the Council, may not be fully aware of his plans and could be just as afraid as the old man in the story. However, Svan still relies on them to create a diversion so that he can plant the bomb undetected, indicating his willingness to use others for his cause even if it puts them in danger." />
    <node id="The bomber, Svan, was clutching a piece of paper with a cross on both sides because it was a symbol used by the Council, a group of Venusians who opposed the arrival of colonists from Earth. The cross was a sign that someone had drawn the first lot in a selection process and was considered a coward for not volunteering to carry out a mission. Svan found it puzzling because he did not know who among his group had drawn the first cross, and he wondered if it could be Ingra or one of the men. The surgeon also found it puzzling because he did not understand its significance in relation to the bomber's mission or background." />
    <node id="1. Svan plans to plant a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. This is part of the Council's plan to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus, even if it means using violent means.&#10;2. The old man questions if the Council has authorized &quot;murder&quot; because Svan's plan involves using violence against the occupants of the Earth-ship, which would likely result in their deaths. The old man is uncomfortable with this level of violence and expresses his concern about the Council authorizing murder, although he ultimately goes along with Svan's plan." />
    <node id="Based on the story, the group on Venus has decided that they must prevent the Earth-ship from returning to Earth if it should return to Venus. The Council, which consists of the descendants of the first Earthmen to land on Venus, believes that the arrival of colonists from Earth would lead to disaster for Venus. They have agreed that, if the Earth-ship returns, they will take action to ensure it never gets back to Earth.&#10;&#10;Svan, one of the members of the group, has proposed a plan to plant a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship. The bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space, making it impossible for the occupants to return to Earth. While some members of the group express concern about the use of violence and the possibility of retaliation from the Earth-ship, they ultimately go along with Svan's plan.&#10;&#10;Therefore, given the circumstances described in the story, the group has decided that preventing the Earth-ship from returning to Earth is necessary to protect Venus and its inhabitants from potential colonization and disaster." />
    <node id="1. The plan devised by Svan involves all six of them going to see the Earth-ship in his ground car as a ruse to get close to the ship. One of them, Svan himself, will then get out at a good point and hide, while the other five return in the car which will have an apparent malfunction, such as running off the road or sinking in the swamp, to create a commotion and distract the guards. This will provide cover for Svan to approach the ship undetected and plant the bomb that he has with him. The bomb is magnetic and will not be noticed in the dark, allowing Svan to attach it to the ship before takeoff. The ship's occupants will not suspect anything because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space.&#10;2. Ingra and the other four members of their group are tasked with creating a commotion near the Earth-ship while Svan plants the bomb inside it. They will do this by making it seem like something has gone wrong with the car, which will draw the guards away from their posts and give Svan an opportunity to sneak aboard undetected.&#10;3. Svan is not very confident in Ingra and the others' ability to follow through with the plan, but he still relies on them to create the necessary diversion for his plan to succeed. He knows that their actions will be crucial in allowing him to plant the bomb without being caught." />
    <node id="1. Svan is contemplating deceit and waiting for an opportunity by the roadside because he knows that the sentries on the Earth-ship are better equipped and will not be as easily overcome as the natives. He cannot force the Earthmen to stay, so he plans to use deceit to get to the side of the ship. Svan is aware that the ground rises and the jungle plants thin out near the Earth-ship, indicating that he is approaching a clearing where the ship has landed. The sentries with slim-shafted blasters that he sees are guarding the ship and would not be easily overcome, making deceit the best option for Svan to get on board undetected. He settles himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance, which he reckons will come in about three minutes. Svan plans to plant a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. This is part of the Council's plan to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus, even if it means using violent means.&#10;2. Svan has doubts about Ingra's loyalty and the ability of his team to follow through with the plan. He suspects that one of them may have informed someone about their plan and becomes paranoid when he hears a ground car racing towards him. When Ingra warns him about the Earthmen who are coming after them, Svan tells her to go away, indicating that he does not fully trust her. However, despite his doubts, Svan still relies on Ingra and the others to create the necessary diversion for his plan to succeed. He knows that their actions will be crucial in allowing him to plant the bomb without being caught. Therefore, while he may not have complete faith in their abilities, he is still relying on them to play their part in the plan." />

The bomb is magnetic and will not be noticed in the dark, allowing Svan to attach it to the ship before takeoff.&#10;5.

Svan and Ingra claim that they are representatives of the Council, which opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth, but they do not disclose their true intentions.&#10;3. The reason why they wish to look at the Earth-ship is because it is part of Svan's plan to plant a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship.

This is part of the Council's plan to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus, even if it means using violent means." />
    <node id="After realizing that any one of them could be the coward who drew the fatal slip in their lethal game of chance, Svan decided to mark his own slip in secret. This was a desperate measure because it meant that he was willing to take the risk of being caught and potentially killed himself, rather than revealing the identity of the person who drew the fatal slip. By marking his own slip, Svan was able to ensure that he would be the one to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, regardless of whether or not the others went through with their part of the plan. This allowed him to maintain control over the situation and increase the chances of successfully carrying out his mission." />
    <node id=" a second's glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance. Almost he was disappointed.&#10; &#10; Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen one to announce it—a second, ten seconds....&#10; &#10; Then gray understanding came to him. A traitor! his subconscious whispered. A coward! He stared at them in a new light, saw their indecision magnified, became opposition.&#10; &#10; Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision. Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly beneath the table, marked his own slip.&#10; &#10; In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in secret. His voice was very tired as he said, &quot;I will plant the" />
    <node id=" there was only one course remaining. He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength in his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had ruthlessly pounded it against the road.&#10; &#10; &#10; Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.&#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously, then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be no trace.&#10; &#10; Svan strode back to the car. &quot;Hurry up" />

This is part of the Council's plan to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus, even if it means using violent means.&#10;3. To decide who will plant the bomb, Svan proposes using chance by writing down names on slips of paper and drawing one. This shows that he is aware of the fear and uncertainty among the group about carrying out this deadly task, and wants to avoid direct conflict over who will do it. The fact that no one speaks up when Svan asks if anyone is afraid indicates their reluctance to volunteer for such a dangerous mission.&#10;4. It is not explicitly stated in the story who is chosen by chance to plant the bomb, but it can be inferred that Svan's plan to use random selection is carried out. The group ultimately goes along with his plan, indicating their acceptance of this decision-making method and their willingness to take part in the mission, even if they are afraid." />
    <node id="1. In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation. He intends to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. To do this, he enlists the help of Ingra and the others, who will create a commotion near the ship to distract the guards while he plants the bomb.&#10;3. When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation." />

    <node id="Based on the story provided, it is not explicitly stated who or what is targeting the main lock of the ship with a spy ray. The only information given is that an officer of the deck hears a report from the annunciator that a spy ray is focused on the main lock. No further details are provided about the origin or nature of the spy ray." />
    <node id="The Exec in the story expresses mistrust towards the native Venusians, stating that he doesn't trust them and that they don't even look human anymore. He describes their white, flabby skin and refers to them as if they are a different species. Lowry, on the other hand, disagrees with the Exec's opinion and explains that the natives had to acclimate themselves to Venus's climate, which resulted in their physical appearance changing over time. Lowry also mentions that the natives he has spoken to are friendly and that there is a minority who are afraid of the incoming immigrants from Earth. The Exec sees the natives as a potential threat, while Lowry takes a more scientific and sympathetic viewpoint towards them." />

Additionally, if the Earthmen arrive before Ingra and the others have had a chance to create a sufficient diversion, Svan may not have enough time to plant the second bomb and escape without being caught.

In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation. He intends to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. To do this, he enlists the help of Ingra and the others, who will create a commotion near the ship to distract the guards while he plants the bomb.&#10;3. When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation.">

The bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space, making it impossible for the occupants to return to Earth. While some members of the group express concern about the use of violence and the possibility of retaliation from the Earth-ship, they ultimately go along with Svan's plan.&#10;&#10;Therefore, given the circumstances described in the story, the group has decided that preventing the Earth-ship from returning to Earth is necessary to protect Venus and its inhabitants from potential colonization and disaster.">

The bomb is magnetic and will not be noticed in the dark, allowing Svan to attach it to the ship before takeoff.&#10;5. The ship's occupants will not suspect anything because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. This will ensure that the Earth-ship cannot return to Earth and will prevent potential colonization and disaster on Venus.">

By marking his own slip, Svan was able to ensure that he would be the one to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, regardless of whether or not the others went through with their part of the plan. This allowed him to maintain control over the situation and increase the chances of successfully carrying out his mission.">

In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation. He intends to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. To do this, he enlists the help of Ingra and the others, who will create a commotion near the ship to distract the guards while he plants the bomb.&#10;3. When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation.">

The bomb in the car is set to explode when the car is a certain distance away from the ship, which will create a commotion and help cover Svan's actions. However, if the Earthmen approaching them discover the bomb in the car before it explodes, they may become suspicious and search the area or the ship more thoroughly, potentially uncovering Svan's plan to plant the second bomb. Additionally, if the Earthmen arrive before Ingra and the others have had a chance to create a sufficient diversion, Svan may not have enough time to plant the second bomb and escape without being caught. The urgency is heightened by the fact that Svan knows that the success of their mission will mean the departure of the Earth-ship and its occupants, who will never be able to return to Earth.">

The bomb is magnetic and will not be noticed in the dark, allowing Svan to attach it to the ship before takeoff. The ship's occupants will not suspect anything because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space.">

In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation.

When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation.">

In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation.

When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation.">

Additionally, if the Earthmen arrive before Ingra and the others have had a chance to create a sufficient diversion, Svan may not have enough time to plant the second bomb and escape without being caught.

While the guards are distracted, Svan will approach the ship undetected and plant the bomb that he has with him. The bomb is magnetic and will not be noticed in the dark, allowing Svan to attach it to the ship before takeoff.&#10;5. The ship's occupants will not suspect anything because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. This will ensure that the Earth-ship cannot return to Earth and will prevent potential colonization and disaster on Venus.">

Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation.

To do this, he enlists the help of Ingra and the others, who will create a commotion near the ship to distract the guards while he plants the bomb.&#10;3. When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation.">

Lowry, on the other hand, disagrees with the Exec's opinion and explains that the natives had to acclimate themselves to Venus's climate, which resulted in their physical appearance changing over time. Lowry also mentions that the natives he has spoken to are friendly and that there is a minority who are afraid of the incoming immigrants from Earth. The Exec sees the natives as a potential threat, while Lowry takes a more scientific and sympathetic viewpoint towards them.">

Risk to the remaining delegation members: If one member has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, the safety of the other delegates could be at risk as well. The natives may view the delegation with suspicion and hostility, putting the remaining members in danger.&#10;4. Difficulty in identifying the perpetrator: Venus is described as having low visibility due to a vast cloud layer, making it difficult for the Earth-ship's crew to see potential dangers or identify the source of any threats. This could make it more challenging to determine who is responsible for the missing delegation member and take appropriate action.&#10;5. Possible escalation of the rebellion: The story mentions that a revolt is brewing on Venus, led by the descendants of the first Earthmen to land. The disappearance of a delegation member could be seen as an act of aggression, further fueling the rebellion and potentially leading to more violent confrontations.&#10;6. Preventive action against the Earth-ship: If the disappearance of the delegation member is discovered, the Council on Venus may proceed with their plan to prevent the Earth-ship from returning to Earth, which could lead to further conflicts and potential violence.">

The old man is uncomfortable with this level of violence and expresses his concern about the Council authorizing murder, although he ultimately goes along with Svan's plan." target="1. In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation. He intends to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. To do this, he enlists the help of Ingra and the others, who will create a commotion near the ship to distract the guards while he plants the bomb.&#10;3. When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation.">

To decide who will plant the bomb, Svan proposes using chance by writing down names on slips of paper and drawing one. This shows that he is aware of the fear and uncertainty among the group about carrying out this deadly task, and wants to avoid direct conflict over who will do it. The fact that no one speaks up when Svan asks if anyone is afraid indicates their reluctance to volunteer for such a dangerous mission.&#10;4. It is not explicitly stated in the story who is chosen by chance to plant the bomb, but it can be inferred that Svan's plan to use random selection is carried out. The group ultimately goes along with his plan, indicating their acceptance of this decision-making method and their willingness to take part in the mission, even if they are afraid.">

    <edge source="1. In the story, Svan is depicted as a member of the Venusian delegation who opposes the arrival of colonists from Earth. He is part of a group called the Council, which has hostile intentions towards the Earth delegation and plans to use violent means to prevent the Earth-ship's occupants from establishing a permanent presence on Venus.&#10;2. Svan's plan involves using a magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb to harm the Earth delegation. He intends to plant the bomb on the Earth-ship, which will not explode until the ship is far out in space. To do this, he enlists the help of Ingra and the others, who will create a commotion near the ship to distract the guards while he plants the bomb.&#10;3. When Svan reaches into the compartment under the seat of the car, it is revealed that he takes longer than necessary to get out the atomite bomb. It is also mentioned that there was a second bomb in the compartment, which none of the others were aware of. This suggests that Svan had a separate plan or backup strategy in case the first one failed.&#10;4. The mention of &quot;spy-rays&quot; and the &quot;secretive Council&quot; earlier in the conversation refers to the Venusian delegation's use of prohibited surveillance technology and their secretive nature. It is possible that Svan's possession of a second bomb is related to this, as it may indicate that he or the Council had planned to use it for surveillance or other purposes. Alternatively, it could suggest that Svan was planning to use the second bomb as a last resort in case their initial plan failed, or if they encountered unexpected resistance from the Earth delegation." target="1. Retaliation from the Earth-ship: If the disappearance of a delegation member is discovered, the Earth-ship might suspect the natives as being responsible and retaliate against them, increasing tensions and conflicts between the two groups.&#10;2. Deterioration of negotiations: The purpose of the delegation's visit to Venus is to negotiate with the natives and establish peaceful relations. If a member goes missing, it could jeopardize the progress made during the negotiations and make further discussions more challenging.&#10;3. Risk to the remaining delegation members: If one member has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, the safety of the other delegates could be at risk as well. The natives may view the delegation with suspicion and hostility, putting the remaining members in danger.&#10;4. Difficulty in identifying the perpetrator: Venus is described as having low visibility due to a vast cloud layer, making it difficult for the Earth-ship's crew to see potential dangers or identify the source of any threats. This could make it more challenging to determine who is responsible for the missing delegation member and take appropriate action.&#10;5. Possible escalation of the rebellion: The story mentions that a revolt is brewing on Venus, led by the descendants of the first Earthmen to land. The disappearance of a delegation member could be seen as an act of aggression, further fueling the rebellion and potentially leading to more violent confrontations.&#10;6. Preventive action against the Earth-ship: If the disappearance of the delegation member is discovered, the Council on Venus may proceed with their plan to prevent the Earth-ship from returning to Earth, which could lead to further conflicts and potential violence.">

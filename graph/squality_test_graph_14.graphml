    <node id="The dream that Smokey Kaiser frequently experiences is a reflection of his unhappiness and dissatisfaction with his life back home, which he had hoped to escape by joining the space service. In his dream, he returns to his old home where he feels unloved and trapped in a marriage with a wife named Helene who only married him for financial security. She never loved him and took revenge on him through constant nagging, growing fat and querulous, and neglecting their house.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Smokey's crippled brother-in-law lived with them from the day they were married, taking pleasure in causing trouble for Smokey. This strained relationship between Smokey and Helene, along with his longing to escape his mundane life, led him to join the space service.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that this information about Smokey's dream and his relationship with Helene is inferred from the text, as it is not explicitly stated but rather presented through context clues." />

His mind was as crippled as his body and he took an unhealthy delight in helping his sister torment Kaiser.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an hour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still five more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck and shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.&#10; &#10; After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of Big Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a heavy drizzle now.&#10; &#10; Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest against one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots and a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with a slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll over onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.&#10; &#10; The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.&#10; &#10; Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before" />

Soon he was in that phantasm land between sleep and wakefulness—he knew he was not sleeping, yet he did dream.&#10; &#10; It was the same dream he had had many times before. In it, he was back home again, the home he had joined the space service to escape. He had realized soon after his marriage that his wife, Helene, did not love him.

    <node id=" KNOW.&#10; &#10; &#10; SS II&#10; &#10; Kaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape thoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large drops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout ship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn this climate!&quot; Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. &quot;Doesn't it ever do anything here except rain?&quot;&#10; &#10; His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And why was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been doing during that time?&#10; &#10; Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture from his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out when the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he was stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the job very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle alone—or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or no chance of his being able to find either here.&#10; &#10; Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and brought them out" />
    <node id="1. To break free from being held underwater, Kaiser brought his knee up into the stomach of the native who was holding him, causing her to loosen her grip. He was then able to reach the surface and swim to shore.&#10;&#10;2. Kaiser found it difficult to explain his actions to the natives because they seemed to view his struggle as unnecessary or inexplicable hostility. He had no way to communicate to them that he needed to breathe air, and any attempt to do so may have been seen as further aggression. Additionally, the regulations he was bound by required him to display no hostility to newly discovered natives, adding to the complexity of the situation." />

They sank deeper.&#10; &#10; When his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of bubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee up into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the surface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his feet hit the river bottom.&#10; &#10; As he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and seemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying to think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but there was none. He shrugged helplessly.&#10; &#10; There was no longer anything to be gained by staying here—if they had the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for them—and he packed and started back to the scout.&#10; &#10; Kaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey.

They varied in size from small seal-pups to full-grown adults. Some chewed on bunches of water weed, which they manipulated with their lips and drew into their mouths.&#10; &#10; They had mammalian characteristics, Kaiser had noted before, so it was not difficult to distinguish the females from the males. The proportion was roughly fifty-fifty.&#10; &#10; Several of the bolder males climbed up beside Kaiser and began pawing his plastic clothing. Kaiser stood still and tried to keep his breathing shallow, for their odor was almost more than he could bear. One native smeared Kaiser's face with an exploring paw and Kaiser gagged and pushed him roughly away. He was bound by regulations to display no hostility to newly discovered natives, but he couldn't take much more of this.&#10; &#10; A young female splashed water on two young males who stood near and they turned with shrill pipings and chased her into the water. The entire group seemed to lose interest in Kaiser and joined in the chase, or went back to other diversions of their own. Kaiser" />

Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at peace with this world.&#10; &#10; Once, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise of some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in case. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the beast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as it went.&#10; &#10; The next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of shorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in the water when he arrived and were very friendly.&#10; &#10; That friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded around as he swam—they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency—and often nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had difficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he neared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and pulled him under.&#10; &#10; Kaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was clowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him helpless.

He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his toothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that might have been a greeting—or a warning to the others that a stranger approached.&#10; &#10; The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery body of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms to his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in three-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick, with footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave his legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish smell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.&#10; &#10; The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling slightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm forward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main group.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; They had stopped their play and eating as Kaiser approached and now most of them swam in to shore and stood in the water" />

However, there were other seal-people here.&#10; &#10; And they were almost human!&#10; &#10; The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup—that was little changed from the first he had found—as in their obviously greater intelligence.&#10; &#10; This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked. Kaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he slipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them. Where the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly alike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these had no odor—only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet him, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.&#10; &#10; Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes of curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set" />

    <node id="1. Reasons behind Kaiser's baby talk and memory issues:&#10;Kaiser's baby talk might be the result of early stages of illness, possibly due to the humid and warm climate of Big Muddy or exposure to some local pathogen. The story mentions that his memories are hazy and he has amnesia regarding recent events, which also supports this theory.&#10;   &#10;2. Challenges in repairing the scout ship:&#10;Kaiser is faced with several challenges while trying to repair his scout ship on Big Muddy. These include:&#10;  a. Climate: The constant rain and humid weather make it difficult for him to work outside, and he has limited resources to build or improvise shelter in this environment.&#10;  b. Equipment and expertise: While Kaiser mentions that he has assessed the damage to the scout ship and found it too big to handle alone without better equipment, the story does not provide further details on what exactly is required for repairs.&#10;  c. Time constraint: The Soscites II can't slow down or stop to wait for Kaiser; it has limited fuel and needs to maintain its orbit around Big Muddy. This means that Kaiser must repair his scout ship within a month, adding urgency to the situation.&#10;  d. Communication difficulties: With his memory issues and the increasingly incomprehensible messages he transmits to the Soscites II, it seems less likely that he will receive appropriate help or assistance from the mother ship.&#10;  e. Physical challenges: The story does not mention any medical or health problems specific to Kaiser; however, with his crippled brother-in-law living with him and taking delight in tormenting him, it can be inferred that some degree of physical impairment may exist. This could add complexity to the tasks required for repairing the scout ship.&#10;&#10;Overall, the reasons behind Kaiser's baby talk and memory issues are not explicitly stated but are implied to be related to an illness he is developing due to environmental factors on Big Muddy. The challenges he faces in repairing his scout ship include a difficult climate, lack of appropriate equipment, time constraints, communication difficulties, and potential physical impairments." />
    <node id=" or no chance of his being able to find either here.&#10; &#10; Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and brought them out where he could look at them:&#10; &#10; The mother ship, Soscites II , had been on the last leg of its planet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout ship—the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the exploring of new worlds—and set itself into a giant orbit about this planet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy.&#10; &#10; The Soscites II had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means of slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop. Its limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an orbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle a pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.&#10; &#10; Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here forever.&#10; &#10; That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing recently.&#10; &#10; A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the tape in his hand. Baby talk....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" the planet for two weeks yet.&#10; &#10; Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used to wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the vicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went back inside.&#10; &#10; Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the captain himself:&#10; &#10; WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR SCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN ORDER!&#10; &#10; &#10; H. A. HESSE, CAPT.&#10; &#10; Kaiser pushed the last of his meal—which he had been eating with his fingers—into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his hands with it and dropped it to the floor.&#10; &#10; He pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding the captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for serious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only to the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment. It was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from the ship on" />
    <node id="The dire situation that led Kaiser to destroy the communicator is the discovery that he has been infected by a symbiote during his exploration of the planet, which is either in the form of a very thin liquid or a virus with swift propagation characteristics. The symbiote is causing him to physically resemble the human-like beings on the planet, which is a dangerous situation as he was previously ordered to avoid any contact with them to prevent contamination. The crew of the Soscites II, after consulting with an expert named Sam, concluded that Kaiser must return immediately to prevent the infection from becoming acute. However, Kaiser, now partially resembling the natives and feeling more contented among them, decides to destroy the communicator to ignore this order and continue living on the planet." />
    <node id=" there were fewer people here, but he was brought into such intimate contact with them that he would have been more contented living in a crowded city.&#10; &#10; His naturally unsociable nature was more irksome to the crew because he was more intelligent and efficient than they were. He did his work well and painstakingly and was seldom in error. They would have liked him better had he been more prone to mistakes. He was certain that they respected him, but they did not like him. And he returned the dislike.&#10; &#10; The suggestion that he get some sleep might not be a bad idea. He hadn't slept in over eighteen hours, Kaiser realized—and fell instantly asleep.&#10; &#10; The communicator had a message waiting for him when he awoke:&#10; &#10; SAM COULDN'T HELP US MUCH ON THIS PART, BUT AFTER RESEARCH AND MUCH DISCUSSION, WE ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING TWO CONCLUSIONS.&#10; &#10; FIRST, PHYSICAL PROPERTY OF SYMBIOTE IS EITHER THAT OF A VERY THIN LIQUID OR, MORE PROBABLY, A VIRUS FORM WITH SWIFT PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTIC.

REPEAT: IMMEDIATELY!&#10; &#10; &#10; SS II&#10; &#10; Kaiser picked up a large rock and slowly, methodically pounded the communicator into a flattened jumble of metal and loose parts.&#10; &#10; When he finished, he returned to the waiting girl on the river bank. She pointed at his plastic trousers and made laughing sounds in her throat. Kaiser returned the laugh and stripped off the trousers. They ran, still laughing, into the water.&#10; &#10; Already the long pink hair that had been growing on his body during the past week was beginning to turn brown at the roots." />

Above the waist, he wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his bare skin were pleasant to feel.&#10; &#10; When he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The tarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free it. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling the equipment to the ground.&#10; &#10; Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in the tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly his eyes widened.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Moving quickly to the door of the scout, he shoved his equipment through and crawled in behind it. He did not consult the communicator, as he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped place on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there.&#10; &#10; Inserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine casing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried again, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The metal beneath yielded slightly—but" />
    <node id="1. The weather on Big Muddy is typically wet, humid, and warm. There are also extreme seasonal changes, ranging from extreme moisture during the spring and fall to extreme aridity in the dry season, when the planet becomes completely devoid of surface liquid.&#10;2. Kaiser noticed that the tracks from his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain.&#10;3. As he approached a wide, sluggish river, Kaiser heard the pipings and whistling of the seal-people before seeing them. Most of them were swimming in the river.&#10;4. The seal-people have a rank-fish smell that makes Kaiser's stomach squirm. They are about five feet tall, with heavy, blubbery bodies of seals, short thick arms with membranes connecting to their bodies, and three-fingered, thumbless hands. Their legs resemble a split tail with footpads splayed out at 45-degree angles.&#10;5. On this occasion, Kaiser encountered more advanced seal-people who displayed greater intelligence through their facile expressions and syllabism in their pipings. They also had distinct individual characteristics and no odor, only a mild, rather pleasing scent." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.&#10; &#10; Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid ground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside the ship, the &quot;octopus&quot; was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae, extending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded temperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary conditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and all its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.&#10; &#10; Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide, sluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there, he headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a higher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw them. As usual, most were swimming in the river.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture of gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps a lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his toothless" />
    <node id=" IN TEN OR TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE KEEP CONTACT WITH SCOUT.&#10; &#10; &#10; SMOKY&#10; &#10; Kaiser packed a mudsled with tent, portable generator and guard wires, a spare sidearm and ammunition, and food for two days. He had noticed that a range of high hills, which caused the bend in the river at the native settlement, seemed to continue its long curve, and he wondered if the hills might not turn the river in the shape of a giant horseshoe. He intended to find out.&#10; &#10; Wrapping his equipment in a plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out the doorway and tied it on the sled. He hooked a towline to a harness on his shoulders and began his journey—in the opposite direction from the first native settlement.&#10; &#10; He walked for more than seven hours before he found that his surmise had been correct. And a second cluster of huts, and seal-people in the river, greeted his sight. He received a further pleasant surprise. This group was decidedly more advanced than the first!&#10; &#10; They were little different in actual physical appearance; the change was mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was more subdued," />
    <node id="1. Kaiser's initial interaction with the natives was peaceful and friendly, as indicated by the exchange of river weed between him and the thick-bodied male native. The gesture of bringing him a mouthful of weed was likely a sign of welcome or friendship.&#10;2. The appearance of the natives had changed slightly since Kaiser's first encounter with them - they were more subdued in their actions and demeanor, and their odor was less repugnant. This may indicate an attempt to appear less threatening or more appealing to Kaiser.&#10;3. The fact that Kaiser ate the river weed and waited for a reaction suggests that he was trying to be respectful and open-minded towards the natives and their culture. This willingness to try their food is likely to have been seen as a positive gesture on his part.&#10;4. Overall, Kaiser's initial interaction with the natives appears to have been friendly and peaceful, with both sides making efforts to communicate and understand each other." />
    <node id=" first!&#10; &#10; They were little different in actual physical appearance; the change was mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was more subdued, less repugnant.&#10; &#10; By signs, Kaiser indicated that he came in peace, and they seemed to understand. A thick-bodied male went solemnly to the river bank and called to a second, who dived and brought up a mouthful of weed. The first male took the weed and brought it to Kaiser. This was obviously a gesture of friendship.&#10; &#10; The weed had a white starchy core and looked edible. Kaiser cleaned part of it with his handkerchief, bit and chewed it.&#10; &#10; The weed had a slight iron taste, but was not unpalatable. He swallowed the mouthful and tried another. He ate most of what had been given him and waited with some trepidation for a reaction.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; As dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the native settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react to the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by his digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at peace with this world.&#10;" />
    <node id="based on the story, a symbiote has a non-parasitic relationship with its host, meaning it does not harm the host intentionally. Instead, the welfare of the symbiote is closely tied to that of the host, as they depend on each other for survival. If the host dies, the symbiote will likely die as well. Any problems or difficulties experienced by Kaiser during the initial stages of infection were probably due to the symbiote's struggle to adapt to its new environment. This adjustment period can cause unintentional harm to the host, but it is not malicious in nature. The ship's doctor also mentions envying Kaiser for having a symbiote, suggesting that there may be benefits to this relationship, which are yet to be explored in the story." />
    <node id=" NOW!&#10; &#10; &#10; SOSCITES II&#10; &#10; Kaiser's reply was short and succinct:&#10; &#10; WHAT THE HELL?&#10; &#10; SMOKY&#10;  Soscites II's next communication followed within twenty minutes and was signed by the ship's doctor:&#10; &#10; JUST A FEW WORDS, SMOKY, IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED. I THOUGHT I'D GET THIS OFF WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM SAM. REMEMBER THAT A SYMBIOTE IS NOT A PARASITE. IT WILL NOT HARM YOU, EXCEPT INADVERTENTLY. YOUR WELFARE IS AS ESSENTIAL TO IT AS TO YOU. ALMOST CERTAINLY, IF YOU DIE, IT WILL DIE WITH YOU. ANY TROUBLE YOU'VE HAD SO FAR WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE SYMBIOTE'S DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING ITSELF TO ITS NEW ENVIRONMENT. IN A WAY, I ENVY YOU.

    <node id="&#10; Opening the tube again would not have been difficult, but first it had to be freed from under the ship. Kaiser had tried forcing the sheet metal back into place with a small crowbar—the best leverage he had on hand—but it resisted his best efforts. He still could think of no way to do the job, simple as it was, though he gave his concentration to it the rest of the day.&#10; &#10; That evening, Kaiser received information from the Soscites II that was at least definite:&#10; &#10; SET YOURSELF FOR A SHOCK, SMOKY. SAM FINALLY CAME THROUGH. YOU WON'T LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR. AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST. BUT IT COULD BE WORSE. YOU HAVE BEEN INVADED BY A SYMBIOTE—SIMILAR TO THE TYPE FOUND ON THE SAND WORLD, BARTEL-BLEETHERS. GIVE US A FEW MORE HOURS TO WORK WITH SAM AND WE'LL GET YOU ALL THE PARTICULARS HE CAN GIVE US. HANG ON NOW!&#10; &#10; &#10; SOSCITES II&#10; &#10; Kaiser's reply was short and succinct:&#10; &#10; WHAT THE HELL?&#10; " />

    <node id=" ENVY YOU. MORE LATER, WHEN WE FINISH WITH SAM.&#10; &#10; &#10; J. G. ZARWELL&#10; &#10; Kaiser did not answer. The news was so startling, so unforeseen, that his mind refused to accept the actuality. He lay on the scout's bunk and stared at the ceiling without conscious attention, and with very little clear thought, for several hours—until the next communication came in:&#10; &#10; WELL, THIS IS WHAT SAM HAS TO SAY, SMOKY. SYMBIOTE AMICABLE AND APPARENTLY SWIFTLY ADAPTABLE.

At first, despite the lack of success in straightening the bent metal of the scout bottom, there had been a subdued exhilaration in reporting each new discovery concerning the symbiote, but as time passed, his enthusiasm ebbed. His one really important problem was how to repair the scout and he was fast becoming discouraged.&#10; &#10; At last Kaiser could bear the futility of his efforts no longer. He sent out a terse message to the Soscites II :&#10; &#10; TAKING SHORT TRIP TO ANOTHER LOCATION ON RIVER. HOPE TO FIND MORE INTELLIGENT NATIVES. COULD BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT I FOUND HERE IS ANALOGOUS TO TRIBE OF MONKEYS ON EARTH. I KNOW THE CHANCE IS SMALL, BUT WHAT HAVE I TO LOSE?

    <node id="1. Arm swelling: This could be a localized reaction to the symbiote's entry into his body. It might also be a sign of an immune response trying to contain the infection.&#10;&#10;2. Inability to keep down food for the last twelve hours: This could indicate that the symbiote is affecting Kaiser's gastrointestinal system, possibly altering his digestion or appetite.&#10;&#10;3. Entire body turning livid red: This sudden change in skin color may suggest that the symbiote is causing a systemic response, changing his circulation or skin pigmentation to adapt him to the environment of the planet.&#10;&#10;4. Brief periods of blankness: These episodes might be related to the &quot;things keep coming and going&quot; statement. They could be brief losses of consciousness or moments where Kaiser's thoughts become unclear due to the symbiote's influence on his mind.&#10;&#10;5. Thin liquid or virus form with swift propagation characteristics: This description suggests that the symbiote is a highly adaptable and rapidly spreading infectious agent, which can explain its ability to alter Kaiser's physiology significantly.&#10;&#10;6. Close contact with glands and their secretions: The symbiote's ability to gauge Kaiser's feelings accurately implies it has access to or influences his endocrine system, affecting his emotional state and potentially his cognitive functions as well.&#10;&#10;7. Changing the mind of the host: As warned by Soscites II, the symbiote might alter Kaiser's mind and behavior, making him more like the native seal-people. This could be a gradual process that affects his judgment, memory, or personality." />

ON THE CONTRARY, YOU ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE THEM.&#10; &#10; DANG" />
    <node id="1. Changing color: The symbiote altered Kaiser's skin color as a protective camouflage to help him blend in with the environment on the planet.&#10;2. Difficulty keeping down food: The symbiote kept Kaiser's stomach empty because it sensed he was in trouble and might need sharp reflexes, without any excess weight to carry.&#10;3. Baby talk: This was likely a result of the symbiote trying to help Kaiser communicate with the native seal-people by making his speech resemble theirs.&#10;&#10;These changes were all attempts by the symbiote to adapt and give Kaiser what it believed he needed or wanted in order to survive and interact better with the natives on the planet." />
    <node id="1. The physical property of the symbiote is either that of a very thin liquid or, more probably, a virus form with swift propagation characteristics.&#10;2. This information was obtained through research and discussion by the crew after they found that Sam, another source of information, couldn't provide much help on this particular subject. They arrived at these conclusions after studying available data and engaging in discussions to better understand the nature of the symbiote." />
    <node id="Kaiser finds himself stranded on a planet named Big Muddy, after his scout ship was damaged during planet-mapping tour. The mother ship, Soscites II, has set itself into a giant orbit about this planet and has limited maneuverability due to low fuel. It takes approximately one month for the Soscites II to circle a pinpointed planet. Kaiser has only one month to repair his scout ship, or he will be stranded on the planet forever. However, Kaiser is currently distracted by the discovery of a symbiote infecting him and causing him to physically resemble the human-like beings on the planet, which he finds more contented with. He has decided to destroy the communicator to ignore orders from Soscites II and continue living on the planet." />
    <node id="OPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES.&#10; &#10; &#10; SS II&#10; &#10; Kaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had covered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to sleep.&#10; &#10; In the morning, another message was waiting:&#10; &#10; VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY.&#10; &#10; &#10; SS II&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the Soscites II be experiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they were, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a suggestion of urgency—there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of information.&#10; &#10; Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser. He knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time. And the Soscites II would not complete its orbit of the planet for two weeks yet.&#10; &#10; Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used to wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered list" />
    <node id="Based on Kaiser's acceptance and consumption of the river weed offered by the natives, it can be inferred that he was trying to be respectful and open-minded towards their culture. Eating the food of another culture is often seen as a way to show respect and build trust, and this likely applied to Kaiser's interaction with the natives as well. Additionally, his willingness to try the river weed and eat most of what was given to him suggests that he did not view the gesture as threatening or hostile, but rather saw it as an opportunity to connect with the natives and understand them better. This initial friendly and peaceful interaction likely set a positive tone for their future interactions." />
    <node id="The story explains that Kaiser is waiting for his spaceship, the SS II, to arrive on Big Muddy, a planet where he has been exploring. However, he becomes infected by a symbiote during his exploration, which causes him to physically resemble the human-like beings on the planet. This discovery makes him decide to destroy the communicator so that he can ignore the order to return immediately and continue living on the planet among the natives.&#10;&#10;Before destroying the communicator, Kaiser goes outside in the middle of the night due to his restlessness and unease. The story mentions that he has been feeling increasingly contented among the natives, who have a more laid-back lifestyle compared to the crew of the SS II. The infection has also made him speak and think differently, which is reflected in his baby talk message to the ship.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Kaiser's restlessness and decision to go outside are likely due to his internal conflict between following his orders and staying on Big Muddy with the natives. The wet, humid, and warm weather emphasize the challenging environment of the planet, making it more difficult for him to make a decision." />
    <node id="1. Kaiser's increased strength could be a result of his body adapting to the conditions on Big Muddy or an effect of the virus symbiosis mentioned in the report from SS II. This might help him survive and complete the repairs on the scout ship, as he will need to handle heavy equipment and materials.&#10;&#10;2. The Octopus' weather-cycle changes reports indicate that Big Muddy experiences extreme seasonal variations between wet and dry periods. At the height of the dry season, the planet becomes completely devoid of surface liquid. These radical changes suggest that any life forms on the planet, like the seal-people, must have extraordinary adaptability to survive such drastic conditions. The symbiosis with the virus form could facilitate these physical changes and explain why some seal-people display greater intelligence and individual characteristics.&#10;&#10;In summary, Kaiser's increased strength will likely aid him in repairing the scout ship, while the Octopus' weather-cycle reports emphasize the need for extreme adaptability among native life forms on Big Muddy. This information highlights the challenges that both Kaiser and the seal-people face in surviving the harsh environment of this planet." />
    <node id=" he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried again, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The metal beneath yielded slightly—but he felt the palms of his hands bruise against the lever.&#10; &#10; Only after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted. His hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased tremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried again. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly—until the fuel pump hung free!&#10; &#10; Kaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution rest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its anticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act.&#10; &#10; He transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to read the two messages waiting for him.&#10; &#10; The first was quite routine:&#10; &#10; REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL WEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME MOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY.

    <node id="1. A symbiote has a non-parasitic relationship with its host, meaning it does not harm the host intentionally. Instead, the welfare of the symbiote is closely tied to that of the host, as they depend on each other for survival. If the host dies, the symbiote will likely die as well.&#10;2. Any problems or difficulties experienced by the host during the initial stages of infection are probably due to the symbiote's struggle to adapt to its new environment, which can cause unintentional harm to the host. This adjustment period is not malicious in nature.&#10;3. The ship's doctor, J.G. Zarwell, even mentions envying the host for having a symbiote, suggesting that there may be benefits to this relationship, which are yet to be explored in the story." />
    <node id="1. Reasons for Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;Smoky Kaiser decides to take a short trip to another location on the river because he is becoming increasingly discouraged with his lack of success in repairing the scout ship and finding a way to communicate effectively with the Soscites II. He hopes to find more intelligent natives who might be able to provide him with better tools or equipment that could help him fix the scout. Additionally, he sees this as an opportunity to explore a new settlement and possibly discover advancements compared to the first one he encountered.&#10;&#10;2. Goals of Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;During his trip, Smoky hopes to achieve the following goals:&#10;  a. Find more intelligent natives: He believes that these new natives may possess better tools or equipment that could help him repair the scout ship.&#10;  b. Explore the new settlement: By visiting another native settlement, he can expand his knowledge of the area and potentially discover valuable resources or information.&#10;  c. Obtain necessary equipment: If he is successful in finding more advanced natives, he might be able to trade for or acquire the tools and parts needed to fix the scout ship.&#10;  d. Improve communication: Encountering a more intelligent native civilization could potentially lead to better communication methods, allowing him to send clearer messages back to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;Overall, Smoky Kaiser's short trip to another location on the river is driven by his desperation to repair the scout ship and find effective ways to communicate with the Soscites II. He sees this as an opportunity to discover new resources and technologies that could help him achieve these goals." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the tape in his hand. Baby talk....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; One thing he could find out: how long this had been going on. He turned to the communicator and unhooked the paper receptacle on its bottom. It held about a yard and a half of tape, probably his last several messages—both those sent and those received. He pulled it out impatiently and began reading.&#10; &#10; The first was from himself:&#10; &#10; YOUR SUGGESTIONS NO HELP. HOW AM I GOING TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO SCOUT WITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT?

    <node id="1. The decrease in Kaiser's discomfort from high humidity despite no change in the ship's thermometer indicates that something other than traditional air conditioning is responsible for the temperature change he perceives. This might be due to the symbiote's ability to manipulate the environment within the scout cabin, as suggested earlier when Kaiser focused on his discomfort with the high humidity and the symbiote lowered the moisture levels.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that the ship's thermometer still shows no change during these exchanges with the mother ship highlights the inconsistency between what Kaiser is experiencing and what the instruments show. This discrepancy could be a result of the symbiote's influence on the localized environment within the scout cabin, which might not be detectable by the ship's thermometer.&#10;&#10;3. The decreased discomfort from high humidity and warm temperatures that Kaiser perceives may provide further evidence for his developing illness due to environmental factors on Big Muddy. It is possible that the symbiote is trying to help him by adjusting the temperature in the scout cabin, but it might not be able to completely counteract the effects of the humid and warm climate." />
    <node id=" to the rear of the scout, he tried reading the printed words on the instrument panel. Each letter stood out sharp and clear!&#10; &#10; Kaiser wondered if he might not make an immediate, practical use of the symbiote's apparent desire to help him. Concentrating on the discomfort of the high humidity and exaggerating his own displeasure with it, he waited. The result surprised and pleased him.&#10; &#10; The temperature within the scout cabin seemed to lower, the moisture on his body vanished, and he was more comfortable than he had yet been here.&#10; &#10; As a double check, he looked at the ship's thermometer. Temperature&#10;102, humidity 113—just about the same as it had been on earlier readings.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; During the next twenty-four hours, Kaiser and the mother ship exchanged messages at regular six-hour intervals. In between, he worked at repairing the damaged scout. He had no more success than before.&#10; &#10; He tired easily and lay on the cot often to rest. Each time he seemed to drop off to sleep immediately—and awake at the exact times he had decided on beforehand.

    <node id="1. The seal-people Kaiser encounters during his second journey are more advanced than the ones he met on his first journey. This is evident in their greater intelligence, which is shown through their facile expressions and distinct syllabism in their pipings. They also have more pronounced individual characteristics and no longer have the strong rank-fish smell that Kaiser found repugnant. Instead, they only have a mild, rather pleasing scent.&#10;2. These seal-people are also able to express distinct syllabism in their pipings, which was not observed in the first group. This suggests a more advanced level of communication and intelligence.&#10;3. The second group of seal-people that Kaiser encounters is also less repugnant in terms of odor. Their odor is more subdued compared to the strong rank-fish smell of the first group, which may indicate better hygiene or living conditions.&#10;4. Overall, the seal-people that Kaiser encounters during his second journey are more advanced and sophisticated than the ones he met on his first journey, as evidenced by their greater intelligence, distinct syllabism in their pipings, individual characteristics, and less repugnant odor." />
    <node id="1. The reason why Kaiser's equipment feels exceptionally light is that the symbiote has taken over or manipulated them to make them lighter for him. This could be a form of assistance from the symbiote, as it might have realized that carrying heavy equipment in the muddy and rainy conditions on Big Muddy would be difficult for Kaiser.&#10;2. Kaiser reacts by lifting the scout bottom to reveal the engine casing because he suspects that the symbiote's influence might extend beyond just his equipment and could affect the scout as well. By checking the engine casing, he is verifying whether there are any changes or adjustments made by the symbiote.&#10;3. This action also shows Kaiser's growing understanding of the symbiote's abilities and willingness to work with it in order to make his life easier on Big Muddy, such as when he concentrates on the discomfort of high humidity to signal the symbiote to adjust the temperature and moisture levels inside the scout cabin." />
    <node id="Based on the story and the supporting materials, it can be inferred that the seal-people Kaiser encounters during his second trip to the river are more advanced and sophisticated than the ones he met on his first trip. This is evident in their physical appearance, intelligence level, and communication abilities.&#10;&#10;Physically, these seal-people have distinct individual characteristics and no longer have the strong rank-fish smell that Kaiser found repugnant. Instead, they only have a mild, rather pleasing scent. This may indicate better hygiene or living conditions for this second group of seal-people.&#10;&#10;In terms of intelligence level, the second group of seal-people is more advanced than the first.

    <node id="1. The story describes the symbiote that has infected Kaiser as being similar to those found on the sand world Bartel-Bleethers. Although no specific type is mentioned, it can be inferred that this symbiote shares characteristics with other known symbiotes from the universe depicted in the story.&#10;&#10;2. The information conveyed by the Soscites II about the symbiote will significantly affect Kaiser in several ways:&#10;&#10;   a. Physical Changes: The symbiote is causing physical changes in Kaiser, such as arm swelling, livid red skin coloration, and difficulty keeping down food. These changes are likely adaptations made by the symbiote to help Kaiser survive on the planet.&#10;&#10;   b. Mental Changes: The symbiote might be influencing Kaiser's mind and behavior, causing him to feel more contented among the native seal-people and make decisions contrary to his original mission. This gradual change in personality and judgment could have severe consequences for Kaiser's ability to repair his scout ship and return to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;   c. Immune Response: The symbiote's presence may trigger an immune response from Kaiser's body, which could further complicate his physical condition and make it more challenging to adapt to the symbiotic relationship.&#10;&#10;   d. Potential Benefits: Despite these challenges, there might be benefits to having a symbiote, as suggested by the ship's doctor. These potential advantages have yet to be explored in the story.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the exact type of symbiote infecting Kaiser remains undisclosed, its impact on him is significant and multifaceted, affecting both his physical well-being and mental state. Understanding more about this symbiote and its influence on Kaiser will be crucial for his survival and successful return to the Soscites II." />
    <node id="1. After traveling for over seven hours with his mudsled, Smokey Kaiser discovered that the range of high hills he had noticed earlier did indeed cause the bend in the river at the native settlement, and they continued their long curve, forming what appeared to be a giant horseshoe shape. At the end of this curve, he found a second cluster of huts and seal-people in the river.&#10;2. This group of natives was more advanced than the first one Kaiser had encountered. Although their physical appearance was little changed, their actions and demeanor were noticeably different - they were more subdued and less repugnant in odor.&#10;3. The second group of natives also showed distinct syllabism in their pipings, indicating a more advanced level of communication and intelligence compared to the first group. They had marked individual characteristics and no longer emitted the strong rank-fish smell that Kaiser found repugnant. Instead, they had a mild, rather pleasing scent.&#10;4. These differences suggest that the second group of natives was at a more advanced stage of development than the first one. This could be due to various factors such as better living conditions, social organization, or access to resources." />
    <node id="Kaiser needed to read the transmission several times before realizing that it was baby talk because the change in communication style was subtle and unexpected. He had become accustomed to reading and interpreting the messages from the expedition in a certain way, and this new form of communication was significantly different from what he was used to. Additionally, he may have been preoccupied or distracted, which could have made it more difficult for him to notice the change.&#10;&#10;He had not noticed the inane language in previous communications because the transmissions had likely been written in standard English up until this point. It is also possible that the baby talk was a gradual development, with earlier messages containing subtle hints of the style that became more pronounced over time. Overall, Kaiser's failure to notice the change may have been due to a combination of factors, including his expectations, focus, and the subtlety of the transformation." />
    <node id=" in their pipings.&#10; &#10; Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes of curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.&#10; &#10; One was a female.&#10; &#10; They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he understood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He tried saying &quot;tent&quot; and &quot;wire&quot; and &quot;tarp&quot; as he handled each object, but their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused himself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was fairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to carry on a limited conversation.&#10; &#10; The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until Kaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached the river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Before he had time to decide, Kaiser heard the small bell of the communicator from the tent behind him. He stood undecided for a moment, then returned and read the message on the tape:&#10; &#10; STILL ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM" />
    <node id="1. The seal-people are curious and social creatures, as they stop their play and eating to approach and stare at Kaiser when he first encounters them. They also display a range of behaviors such as chewing on water weed, pawing at Kaiser's plastic clothing, smearing his face, and engaging in chases and other diversions.&#10;2. Kaiser's reactions to the seal-people are initially negative due to their strong odor, which he finds almost unbearable. He also becomes alarmed when several of them climb up beside him and paw at his clothing. However, as he interacts more with the less repugnant second group, he is able to hear distinct syllabism in their pipings and detect individual characteristics, leading him to believe that they are more advanced and intelligent than the first group he encountered.&#10;3. When a playful female grabs Kaiser by the ankle and pulls him underwater, it suggests that the seal-people are also physically strong and assertive, and may not fully understand human body language or social cues. This incident nearly results in disaster as Kaiser struggles to break free and reach the surface for air." />
    <node id="ince the story mentions that Kaiser has been feeling increasingly contented among the natives on Big Muddy and has even started to physically resemble them due to a symbiote infection, his restlessness and decision to go outside in the middle of the night are likely due to his internal conflict between following his orders and staying on Big Muddy with the natives.&#10;&#10;The story also mentions that Kaiser had been feeling uneasy before going outside, which could be due to his growing attachment to the planet and its inhabitants. The rain and mud emphasize the challenging environment of the planet, making it more difficult for him to make a decision.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the story suggests that Kaiser has been infected by the symbiote for some time, as he has started to speak and think differently, which is reflected in his baby talk message to the ship. Therefore, it is likely that Kaiser's restlessness and decision to go outside are prompted by his internal conflict and growing attachment to Big Muddy." />
    <node id="1. Based on the information from the Soscites II, Kaiser has been invaded by a symbiote, which is not a parasite and will not harm him except inadvertently. Its welfare is as essential to it as to Kaiser. If he dies, the symbiote will likely die with him. Any trouble he has experienced so far might be due to the symbiote's difficulty adjusting to its new environment.&#10;2. The infection caused by the symbiote will affect Kaiser in several ways:&#10;&#10;a. Physical Changes: The symbiote is causing physical changes in Kaiser, such as arm swelling and livid red skin coloration. These changes are likely adaptations made by the symbiote to help Kaiser survive on the planet. It might also be responsible for his difficulty keeping down food.&#10;&#10;b. Mental Changes: The symbiote might be influencing Kaiser's mind and behavior, causing him to feel more contented among the native seal-people and make decisions contrary to his original mission. This gradual change in personality and judgment could have severe consequences for Kaiser's ability to repair his scout ship and return to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;c. Immune Response: The symbiote's presence may trigger an immune response from Kaiser's body, which could further complicate his physical condition and make it more challenging to adapt to the symbiotic relationship.&#10;&#10;d. Potential Benefits: Despite these challenges, there might be benefits to having a symbiote, as suggested by the ship's doctor. These potential advantages have yet to be explored in the story.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the exact type of symbiote infecting Kaiser remains undisclosed, its impact on him is significant and multifaceted, affecting both his physical well-being and mental state. Understanding more about this symbiote and its influence on Kaiser will be crucial for his survival and successful return to the Soscites II." />
    <node id="1. The person's social situation: The text suggests that the person is part of a team or group working together to explore an extraterrestrial planet, possibly through a space program. They communicate with each other via transmissions and seem to have specific roles within the team (e.g., Kaiser being responsible for repairs). The use of informal language (&quot;For God's sake&quot;) indicates that they may have a close working relationship.&#10;2. Significant scientific discovery: Based on the message waiting for them, a significant scientific discovery has been made regarding the native seal-people and their extreme adaptability to weather conditions. This is due to their symbiotic relationship with a specific virus form, which allows them to undergo radical physical changes necessary for survival in the planet's unusual extremes of moisture and aridity during spring and fall seasons. This finding can contribute significantly to understanding adaptation mechanisms in extreme environments, both on Earth and other planets." />
    <node id="Based on the description provided in the story, the dwellings that Kaiser found near the river were round domes built with blocks that appeared to be made of mud, packed with river weed and sand. The domes were low to the ground, little more than the height of a man. Their construction was based on a series of four arches built in a circle, with additional arches built on and between them after the base covering the periphery had been laid.&#10;&#10;It is not explicitly stated in the story how the natives are able to dry the mud blocks in order to give them the necessary solidity, but it is mentioned that Kaiser did not find any signs of fire or evidence that they knew how to use it. Therefore, it can be inferred that they likely rely on sunlight to dry the mud blocks and construct their dwellings.&#10;&#10;There are no further details provided about the source of heat for drying the materials used to build the domes, but it is mentioned that Kaiser did not find any signs of fire or evidence that the natives knew how to use it.

Kaiser's inspectors followed.&#10; &#10; They were a mindless lot, Kaiser observed. The river supplied them with an easy existence, with food and living space, and apparently they had few natural enemies.&#10; &#10; Kaiser walked away, following the long slow bend of the river, and came to a collection of perhaps two hundred dwellings built in three haphazard rows along the river bank. He took time to study their construction more closely this time.&#10; &#10; They were all round domes, little more than the height of a man, built of blocks that appeared to be mud, packed with river weed and sand. How they were able to dry these to give them the necessary solidity, Kaiser did not know. He had found no signs that they knew how to use fire, and all apparent evidence was against their having it. They then had to have sunlight. Maybe it rained less during certain seasons.&#10; &#10; The domes' construction was based on a series of four arches built in a circle.

The ship's communication has been delayed because the Soscites II may be experiencing some difficulty, as suggested by the sudden recall message from the captain.

Challenges in repairing the scout ship:&#10;Kaiser is faced with several challenges while trying to repair his scout ship on Big Muddy. These include:&#10;  a. Climate: The constant rain and humid weather make it difficult for him to work outside, and he has limited resources to build or improvise shelter in this environment.&#10;  b. Equipment and expertise: While Kaiser mentions that he has assessed the damage to the scout ship and found it too big to handle alone without better equipment, the story does not provide further details on what exactly is required for repairs.&#10;  c. Time constraint: The Soscites II can't slow down or stop to wait for Kaiser; it has limited fuel and needs to maintain its orbit around Big Muddy. This means that Kaiser must repair his scout ship within a month, adding urgency to the situation.&#10;  d. Communication difficulties: With his memory issues and the increasingly incomprehensible messages he transmits to the Soscites II, it seems less likely that he will receive appropriate help or assistance from the mother ship.&#10;  e. Physical challenges: The story does not mention any medical or health problems specific to Kaiser; however, with his crippled brother-in-law living with him and taking delight in tormenting him, it can be inferred that some degree of physical impairment may exist. This could add complexity to the tasks required for repairing the scout ship.&#10;&#10;Overall, the reasons behind Kaiser's baby talk and memory issues are not explicitly stated but are implied to be related to an illness he is developing due to environmental factors on Big Muddy. The challenges he faces in repairing his scout ship include a difficult climate, lack of appropriate equipment, time constraints, communication difficulties, and potential physical impairments.">

The weather on Big Muddy is typically wet, humid, and warm.

Kaiser noticed that the tracks from his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain.&#10;3. As he approached a wide, sluggish river, Kaiser heard the pipings and whistling of the seal-people before seeing them. Most of them were swimming in the river.&#10;4. The seal-people have a rank-fish smell that makes Kaiser's stomach squirm. They are about five feet tall, with heavy, blubbery bodies of seals, short thick arms with membranes connecting to their bodies, and three-fingered, thumbless hands. Their legs resemble a split tail with footpads splayed out at 45-degree angles.&#10;5. On this occasion, Kaiser encountered more advanced seal-people who displayed greater intelligence through their facile expressions and syllabism in their pipings. They also had distinct individual characteristics and no odor, only a mild, rather pleasing scent.">

However, he becomes infected by a symbiote during his exploration, which causes him to physically resemble the human-like beings on the planet. This discovery makes him decide to destroy the communicator so that he can ignore the order to return immediately and continue living on the planet among the natives.&#10;&#10;Before destroying the communicator, Kaiser goes outside in the middle of the night due to his restlessness and unease. The story mentions that he has been feeling increasingly contented among the natives, who have a more laid-back lifestyle compared to the crew of the SS II. The infection has also made him speak and think differently, which is reflected in his baby talk message to the ship.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Kaiser's restlessness and decision to go outside are likely due to his internal conflict between following his orders and staying on Big Muddy with the natives.

Kaiser's increased strength could be a result of his body adapting to the conditions on Big Muddy or an effect of the virus symbiosis mentioned in the report from SS II. This might help him survive and complete the repairs on the scout ship, as he will need to handle heavy equipment and materials.&#10;&#10;2. The Octopus' weather-cycle changes reports indicate that Big Muddy experiences extreme seasonal variations between wet and dry periods. At the height of the dry season, the planet becomes completely devoid of surface liquid. These radical changes suggest that any life forms on the planet, like the seal-people, must have extraordinary adaptability to survive such drastic conditions. The symbiosis with the virus form could facilitate these physical changes and explain why some seal-people display greater intelligence and individual characteristics.&#10;&#10;In summary, Kaiser's increased strength will likely aid him in repairing the scout ship, while the Octopus' weather-cycle reports emphasize the need for extreme adaptability among native life forms on Big Muddy. This information highlights the challenges that both Kaiser and the seal-people face in surviving the harsh environment of this planet.">

The decrease in Kaiser's discomfort from high humidity despite no change in the ship's thermometer indicates that something other than traditional air conditioning is responsible for the temperature change he perceives. This might be due to the symbiote's ability to manipulate the environment within the scout cabin, as suggested earlier when Kaiser focused on his discomfort with the high humidity and the symbiote lowered the moisture levels.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that the ship's thermometer still shows no change during these exchanges with the mother ship highlights the inconsistency between what Kaiser is experiencing and what the instruments show. This discrepancy could be a result of the symbiote's influence on the localized environment within the scout cabin, which might not be detectable by the ship's thermometer.&#10;&#10;3. The decreased discomfort from high humidity and warm temperatures that Kaiser perceives may provide further evidence for his developing illness due to environmental factors on Big Muddy. It is possible that the symbiote is trying to help him by adjusting the temperature in the scout cabin, but it might not be able to completely counteract the effects of the humid and warm climate.">

The reason why Kaiser's equipment feels exceptionally light is that the symbiote has taken over or manipulated them to make them lighter for him. This could be a form of assistance from the symbiote, as it might have realized that carrying heavy equipment in the muddy and rainy conditions on Big Muddy would be difficult for Kaiser.&#10;2. Kaiser reacts by lifting the scout bottom to reveal the engine casing because he suspects that the symbiote's influence might extend beyond just his equipment and could affect the scout as well. By checking the engine casing, he is verifying whether there are any changes or adjustments made by the symbiote.&#10;3. This action also shows Kaiser's growing understanding of the symbiote's abilities and willingness to work with it in order to make his life easier on Big Muddy, such as when he concentrates on the discomfort of high humidity to signal the symbiote to adjust the temperature and moisture levels inside the scout cabin.">

Reasons for Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;Smoky Kaiser decides to take a short trip to another location on the river because he is becoming increasingly discouraged with his lack of success in repairing the scout ship and finding a way to communicate effectively with the Soscites II. He hopes to find more intelligent natives who might be able to provide him with better tools or equipment that could help him fix the scout. Additionally, he sees this as an opportunity to explore a new settlement and possibly discover advancements compared to the first one he encountered.&#10;&#10;2. Goals of Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;During his trip, Smoky hopes to achieve the following goals:&#10;  a. Find more intelligent natives: He believes that these new natives may possess better tools or equipment that could help him repair the scout ship.&#10;  b. Explore the new settlement: By visiting another native settlement, he can expand his knowledge of the area and potentially discover valuable resources or information.&#10;  c. Obtain necessary equipment: If he is successful in finding more advanced natives, he might be able to trade for or acquire the tools and parts needed to fix the scout ship.&#10;  d. Improve communication: Encountering a more intelligent native civilization could potentially lead to better communication methods, allowing him to send clearer messages back to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;Overall, Smoky Kaiser's short trip to another location on the river is driven by his desperation to repair the scout ship and find effective ways to communicate with the Soscites II. He sees this as an opportunity to discover new resources and technologies that could help him achieve these goals.">

The decrease in Kaiser's discomfort from high humidity despite no change in the ship's thermometer indicates that something other than traditional air conditioning is responsible for the temperature change he perceives. This might be due to the symbiote's ability to manipulate the environment within the scout cabin, as suggested earlier when Kaiser focused on his discomfort with the high humidity and the symbiote lowered the moisture levels.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that the ship's thermometer still shows no change during these exchanges with the mother ship highlights the inconsistency between what Kaiser is experiencing and what the instruments show. This discrepancy could be a result of the symbiote's influence on the localized environment within the scout cabin, which might not be detectable by the ship's thermometer.&#10;&#10;3. The decreased discomfort from high humidity and warm temperatures that Kaiser perceives may provide further evidence for his developing illness due to environmental factors on Big Muddy. It is possible that the symbiote is trying to help him by adjusting the temperature in the scout cabin, but it might not be able to completely counteract the effects of the humid and warm climate.">

The reason why Kaiser's equipment feels exceptionally light is that the symbiote has taken over or manipulated them to make them lighter for him. This could be a form of assistance from the symbiote, as it might have realized that carrying heavy equipment in the muddy and rainy conditions on Big Muddy would be difficult for Kaiser.&#10;2. Kaiser reacts by lifting the scout bottom to reveal the engine casing because he suspects that the symbiote's influence might extend beyond just his equipment and could affect the scout as well. By checking the engine casing, he is verifying whether there are any changes or adjustments made by the symbiote.&#10;3. This action also shows Kaiser's growing understanding of the symbiote's abilities and willingness to work with it in order to make his life easier on Big Muddy, such as when he concentrates on the discomfort of high humidity to signal the symbiote to adjust the temperature and moisture levels inside the scout cabin.">

After traveling for over seven hours with his mudsled, Smokey Kaiser discovered that the range of high hills he had noticed earlier did indeed cause the bend in the river at the native settlement, and they continued their long curve, forming what appeared to be a giant horseshoe shape. At the end of this curve, he found a second cluster of huts and seal-people in the river.&#10;2. This group of natives was more advanced than the first one Kaiser had encountered. Although their physical appearance was little changed, their actions and demeanor were noticeably different - they were more subdued and less repugnant in odor.&#10;3. The second group of natives also showed distinct syllabism in their pipings, indicating a more advanced level of communication and intelligence compared to the first group. They had marked individual characteristics and no longer emitted the strong rank-fish smell that Kaiser found repugnant. Instead, they had a mild, rather pleasing scent.&#10;4. These differences suggest that the second group of natives was at a more advanced stage of development than the first one. This could be due to various factors such as better living conditions, social organization, or access to resources.">

Kaiser's reactions to the seal-people are initially negative due to their strong odor, which he finds almost unbearable. He also becomes alarmed when several of them climb up beside him and paw at his clothing.

    <edge source="The dire situation that led Kaiser to destroy the communicator is the discovery that he has been infected by a symbiote during his exploration of the planet, which is either in the form of a very thin liquid or a virus with swift propagation characteristics. The symbiote is causing him to physically resemble the human-like beings on the planet, which is a dangerous situation as he was previously ordered to avoid any contact with them to prevent contamination. The crew of the Soscites II, after consulting with an expert named Sam, concluded that Kaiser must return immediately to prevent the infection from becoming acute. However, Kaiser, now partially resembling the natives and feeling more contented among them, decides to destroy the communicator to ignore this order and continue living on the planet." target="1. The story describes the symbiote that has infected Kaiser as being similar to those found on the sand world Bartel-Bleethers. Although no specific type is mentioned, it can be inferred that this symbiote shares characteristics with other known symbiotes from the universe depicted in the story.&#10;&#10;2. The information conveyed by the Soscites II about the symbiote will significantly affect Kaiser in several ways:&#10;&#10;   a. Physical Changes: The symbiote is causing physical changes in Kaiser, such as arm swelling, livid red skin coloration, and difficulty keeping down food. These changes are likely adaptations made by the symbiote to help Kaiser survive on the planet.&#10;&#10;   b. Mental Changes: The symbiote might be influencing Kaiser's mind and behavior, causing him to feel more contented among the native seal-people and make decisions contrary to his original mission. This gradual change in personality and judgment could have severe consequences for Kaiser's ability to repair his scout ship and return to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;   c. Immune Response: The symbiote's presence may trigger an immune response from Kaiser's body, which could further complicate his physical condition and make it more challenging to adapt to the symbiotic relationship.&#10;&#10;   d. Potential Benefits: Despite these challenges, there might be benefits to having a symbiote, as suggested by the ship's doctor. These potential advantages have yet to be explored in the story.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the exact type of symbiote infecting Kaiser remains undisclosed, its impact on him is significant and multifaceted, affecting both his physical well-being and mental state. Understanding more about this symbiote and its influence on Kaiser will be crucial for his survival and successful return to the Soscites II.">

The reason why Kaiser's equipment feels exceptionally light is that the symbiote has taken over or manipulated them to make them lighter for him. This could be a form of assistance from the symbiote, as it might have realized that carrying heavy equipment in the muddy and rainy conditions on Big Muddy would be difficult for Kaiser.&#10;2. Kaiser reacts by lifting the scout bottom to reveal the engine casing because he suspects that the symbiote's influence might extend beyond just his equipment and could affect the scout as well. By checking the engine casing, he is verifying whether there are any changes or adjustments made by the symbiote.&#10;3. This action also shows Kaiser's growing understanding of the symbiote's abilities and willingness to work with it in order to make his life easier on Big Muddy, such as when he concentrates on the discomfort of high humidity to signal the symbiote to adjust the temperature and moisture levels inside the scout cabin.">

They are about five feet tall, with heavy, blubbery bodies of seals, short thick arms with membranes connecting to their bodies, and three-fingered, thumbless hands. Their legs resemble a split tail with footpads splayed out at 45-degree angles.&#10;5. On this occasion, Kaiser encountered more advanced seal-people who displayed greater intelligence through their facile expressions and syllabism in their pipings. They also had distinct individual characteristics and no odor, only a mild, rather pleasing scent." target="1. The seal-people are curious and social creatures, as they stop their play and eating to approach and stare at Kaiser when he first encounters them. They also display a range of behaviors such as chewing on water weed, pawing at Kaiser's plastic clothing, smearing his face, and engaging in chases and other diversions.&#10;2. Kaiser's reactions to the seal-people are initially negative due to their strong odor, which he finds almost unbearable. He also becomes alarmed when several of them climb up beside him and paw at his clothing. However, as he interacts more with the less repugnant second group, he is able to hear distinct syllabism in their pipings and detect individual characteristics, leading him to believe that they are more advanced and intelligent than the first group he encountered.&#10;3. When a playful female grabs Kaiser by the ankle and pulls him underwater, it suggests that the seal-people are also physically strong and assertive, and may not fully understand human body language or social cues. This incident nearly results in disaster as Kaiser struggles to break free and reach the surface for air.">

    <edge source="&#10; &#10; The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.&#10; &#10; Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid ground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside the ship, the &quot;octopus&quot; was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae, extending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded temperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary conditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and all its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.&#10; &#10; Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide, sluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there, he headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a higher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw them. As usual, most were swimming in the river.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture of gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps a lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his toothless" target="1. Kaiser's increased strength could be a result of his body adapting to the conditions on Big Muddy or an effect of the virus symbiosis mentioned in the report from SS II. This might help him survive and complete the repairs on the scout ship, as he will need to handle heavy equipment and materials.&#10;&#10;2. The Octopus' weather-cycle changes reports indicate that Big Muddy experiences extreme seasonal variations between wet and dry periods. At the height of the dry season, the planet becomes completely devoid of surface liquid. These radical changes suggest that any life forms on the planet, like the seal-people, must have extraordinary adaptability to survive such drastic conditions. The symbiosis with the virus form could facilitate these physical changes and explain why some seal-people display greater intelligence and individual characteristics.&#10;&#10;In summary, Kaiser's increased strength will likely aid him in repairing the scout ship, while the Octopus' weather-cycle reports emphasize the need for extreme adaptability among native life forms on Big Muddy. This information highlights the challenges that both Kaiser and the seal-people face in surviving the harsh environment of this planet.">

Reasons for Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;Smoky Kaiser decides to take a short trip to another location on the river because he is becoming increasingly discouraged with his lack of success in repairing the scout ship and finding a way to communicate effectively with the Soscites II. He hopes to find more intelligent natives who might be able to provide him with better tools or equipment that could help him fix the scout. Additionally, he sees this as an opportunity to explore a new settlement and possibly discover advancements compared to the first one he encountered.&#10;&#10;2. Goals of Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;During his trip, Smoky hopes to achieve the following goals:&#10;  a. Find more intelligent natives: He believes that these new natives may possess better tools or equipment that could help him repair the scout ship.&#10;  b. Explore the new settlement: By visiting another native settlement, he can expand his knowledge of the area and potentially discover valuable resources or information.&#10;  c. Obtain necessary equipment: If he is successful in finding more advanced natives, he might be able to trade for or acquire the tools and parts needed to fix the scout ship.&#10;  d. Improve communication: Encountering a more intelligent native civilization could potentially lead to better communication methods, allowing him to send clearer messages back to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;Overall, Smoky Kaiser's short trip to another location on the river is driven by his desperation to repair the scout ship and find effective ways to communicate with the Soscites II. He sees this as an opportunity to discover new resources and technologies that could help him achieve these goals.">

Reasons for Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;Smoky Kaiser decides to take a short trip to another location on the river because he is becoming increasingly discouraged with his lack of success in repairing the scout ship and finding a way to communicate effectively with the Soscites II. He hopes to find more intelligent natives who might be able to provide him with better tools or equipment that could help him fix the scout. Additionally, he sees this as an opportunity to explore a new settlement and possibly discover advancements compared to the first one he encountered.&#10;&#10;2. Goals of Smoky Kaiser's trip:&#10;During his trip, Smoky hopes to achieve the following goals:&#10;  a. Find more intelligent natives: He believes that these new natives may possess better tools or equipment that could help him repair the scout ship.&#10;  b. Explore the new settlement: By visiting another native settlement, he can expand his knowledge of the area and potentially discover valuable resources or information.&#10;  c. Obtain necessary equipment: If he is successful in finding more advanced natives, he might be able to trade for or acquire the tools and parts needed to fix the scout ship.&#10;  d. Improve communication: Encountering a more intelligent native civilization could potentially lead to better communication methods, allowing him to send clearer messages back to the Soscites II.&#10;&#10;Overall, Smoky Kaiser's short trip to another location on the river is driven by his desperation to repair the scout ship and find effective ways to communicate with the Soscites II. He sees this as an opportunity to discover new resources and technologies that could help him achieve these goals.">

The decrease in Kaiser's discomfort from high humidity despite no change in the ship's thermometer indicates that something other than traditional air conditioning is responsible for the temperature change he perceives. This might be due to the symbiote's ability to manipulate the environment within the scout cabin, as suggested earlier when Kaiser focused on his discomfort with the high humidity and the symbiote lowered the moisture levels.&#10;&#10;2. The fact that the ship's thermometer still shows no change during these exchanges with the mother ship highlights the inconsistency between what Kaiser is experiencing and what the instruments show. This discrepancy could be a result of the symbiote's influence on the localized environment within the scout cabin, which might not be detectable by the ship's thermometer.&#10;&#10;3. The decreased discomfort from high humidity and warm temperatures that Kaiser perceives may provide further evidence for his developing illness due to environmental factors on Big Muddy. It is possible that the symbiote is trying to help him by adjusting the temperature in the scout cabin, but it might not be able to completely counteract the effects of the humid and warm climate.">

The information conveyed by the Soscites II about the symbiote will significantly affect Kaiser in several ways:&#10;&#10;   a. Physical Changes: The symbiote is causing physical changes in Kaiser, such as arm swelling, livid red skin coloration, and difficulty keeping down food. These changes are likely adaptations made by the symbiote to help Kaiser survive on the planet.&#10;&#10;   b. Mental Changes: The symbiote might be influencing Kaiser's mind and behavior, causing him to feel more contented among the native seal-people and make decisions contrary to his original mission.

At the end of this curve, he found a second cluster of huts and seal-people in the river.&#10;2. This group of natives was more advanced than the first one Kaiser had encountered. Although their physical appearance was little changed, their actions and demeanor were noticeably different - they were more subdued and less repugnant in odor.&#10;3.

The seal-people are curious and social creatures, as they stop their play and eating to approach and stare at Kaiser when he first encounters them. They also display a range of behaviors such as chewing on water weed, pawing at Kaiser's plastic clothing, smearing his face, and engaging in chases and other diversions.&#10;2. Kaiser's reactions to the seal-people are initially negative due to their strong odor, which he finds almost unbearable. He also becomes alarmed when several of them climb up beside him and paw at his clothing. However, as he interacts more with the less repugnant second group, he is able to hear distinct syllabism in their pipings and detect individual characteristics, leading him to believe that they are more advanced and intelligent than the first group he encountered.&#10;3. When a playful female grabs Kaiser by the ankle and pulls him underwater, it suggests that the seal-people are also physically strong and assertive, and may not fully understand human body language or social cues.

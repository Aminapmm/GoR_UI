    <node id="1. The text states that Oliver identifies the spot where two men had fled over a hedge and through a gap in the meadow. However, when the group searches the area, they find no evidence of anyone being there recently.&#10;&#10;2. The grass was long but not trampled down, and the damp clay by the ditches showed no signs of footprints. Despite an extensive search, they were unable to find any traces or recent footsteps in the area.&#10;&#10;3. The explanation for this could be that the men were careful not to leave any evidence behind, possibly because they were aware they were being pursued. They may have worn appropriate footwear and avoided stepping on damp clay or grassy areas where their footprints would be easily visible. &#10;&#10;4. Another possibility is that the text's description of the search is not exhaustive, and the group might have missed some subtle signs of the men's presence. However, based on the information provided in the narrative, there is no concrete evidence to support either of the fugitives having been in the area." />

'The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew,&#10;running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.'&#10;&#10;The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he spoke, and&#10;looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the&#10;accuracy of what he said.  Still, in no direction were there any&#10;appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.  The grass was&#10;long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had&#10;crushed it.  The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but&#10;in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the&#10;slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the&#10;ground for hours before.&#10;&#10;'This is strange!' said Harry.&#10;&#10;'Strange?' echoed the doctor.  'Blathers and Duff, themselves, could&#10;make nothing of it.'&#10;&#10;Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did&#10;not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further&#10;prosecution hopeless; and even then," />

There were not even the traces of recent&#10;footsteps, to be seen.  They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,&#10;commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.&#10;There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain&#10;that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must&#10;have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could&#10;have accomplished in so short a time.

I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.'&#10;&#10;'Who was the other?' inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.&#10;&#10;'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the&#10;inn,' said Oliver.  'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I&#10;could swear to him.'&#10;&#10;'They took this way?' demanded Harry:  'are you sure?'&#10;&#10;'As I am that the men were at the window,' replied Oliver, pointing&#10;down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from&#10;the meadow.

    <node id="&#10;Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry&#10;Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard&#10;Oliver's history from his mother, understood it at once.&#10;&#10;'What direction did he take?' he asked, catching up a heavy stick which&#10;was standing in a corner.&#10;&#10;'That,' replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; 'I&#10;missed them in an instant.'&#10;&#10;'Then, they are in the ditch!' said Harry.  'Follow!  And keep as near&#10;me, as you can.' So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off&#10;with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the&#10;others to keep near him.&#10;&#10;Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the&#10;course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and&#10;just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking&#10;himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to&#10;possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting&#10;all the while, most prodigiously" />

He was turning out of the gateway when he&#10;accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at&#10;that moment coming out of the inn door.&#10;&#10;'Hah!' cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly&#10;recoiling.  'What the devil's this?'&#10;&#10;'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver; 'I was in a great hurry to get&#10;home, and didn't see you were coming.'&#10;&#10;'Death!' muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large&#10;dark eyes.  'Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He'd start&#10;up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!'&#10;&#10;'I am sorry,' stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild&#10;look.

Meanwhile Oliver was in such a&#10;desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could&#10;have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to&#10;the next stage.  At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having&#10;been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy&#10;delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven&#10;paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along&#10;the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.&#10;&#10;As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and&#10;that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried" />
    <node id="1. Suspense: The text describes the intense anxiety and suspense that arises from standing idly by while the life of a loved one is in danger. This emotional state is characterized by fear, worry, and uncertainty about the outcome.&#10;&#10;2. Helplessness: The narrator highlights the desperation and despair caused by the feeling of helplessness in such situations. There is a strong desire to do something to alleviate the pain or lessen the danger but a lack of power to actually make a difference.&#10;3. Racking thoughts: The passage also discusses the racking thoughts that crowd the mind, causing physical symptoms like a rapidly beating heart and heavy breathing. These thoughts revolve around fears, apprehensions, and regrets about not being able to express love or devotion before it's too late.&#10;4. Sinking of soul and spirit: The sad remembrance of one's helplessness leads to a sinking feeling in the soul and spirit, adding to the emotional turmoil experienced during such times of intense worry and concern for a loved one." />

And what had been the fervency of all the prayers&#10;he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the&#10;agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the&#10;gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge!&#10;&#10;Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by&#10;while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!  Oh!&#10;the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat&#10;violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they&#10;conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to&#10;relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to&#10;alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of&#10;our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what&#10;reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time,&#10;allay them!&#10;&#10;Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still.

Rose, Rose, to know that you were&#10;passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts&#10;upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who&#10;linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that&#10;you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and&#10;the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all&#10;these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved&#10;you--these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,&#10;by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,&#10;and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never&#10;know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in&#10;its course.  You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some&#10;drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream&#10;of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a&#10;high and rushing tide.

'I feared&#10;for a time he might be otherwise.  I was mistaken.  I am very, very&#10;glad.'&#10;&#10;Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed&#10;down Rose's face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in&#10;the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=", as to throw any obstacle&#10;in my way?'&#10;&#10;'I will not,' rejoined Mrs. Maylie; 'but I would have you consider--'&#10;&#10;'I _have_ considered!' was the impatient reply; 'Mother, I have&#10;considered, years and years.  I have considered, ever since I have been&#10;capable of serious reflection.  My feelings remain unchanged, as they&#10;ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them&#10;vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?  No!  Before I leave&#10;this place, Rose shall hear me.'&#10;&#10;'She shall,' said Mrs. Maylie.&#10;&#10;'There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she&#10;will hear me coldly, mother,' said the young man.&#10;&#10;'Not coldly,' rejoined the old lady; 'far from it.'&#10;&#10;'How then?' urged the young man.  'She has formed no other attachment?'&#10;&#10;'No, indeed,' replied his mother; 'you have, or I mistake, too strong a&#10;hold on her affections already.  What I would say,' resumed the old&#10;lady, stopping her" />
    <node id=" I have not hurt you!'&#10;&#10;'Rot you!' murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his&#10;clenched teeth; 'if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might&#10;have been free of you in a night.  Curses on your head, and black death&#10;on your heart, you imp!  What are you doing here?'&#10;&#10;The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He&#10;advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at&#10;him, but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and foaming, in a fit.&#10;&#10;Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he&#10;supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.  Having&#10;seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards,&#10;running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time:  and recalling&#10;with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary&#10;behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.&#10;&#10;The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for&#10;when he reached" />
    <node id="After attending the funeral of the young lady (who remains unnamed in the narrative), Oliver reflects on his relationship with her and the many kindnesses she had shown him. He wishes that he could have done more to show his gratitude and attachment to her, and regrets any missed opportunities to be more zealous and earnest in his service to her. He recognizes that every death leaves survivors with thoughts of omitted actions and unfinished business, and resolves to be more mindful of this in his own relationships. These reflections suggest that Oliver has developed a deep appreciation for the value of kindness and friendship, and recognizes the impact that one person can have on another's life." />
    <node id=" thoughts.&#10;Another!  Again!  It was tolling for the funeral service.  A group of&#10;humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse&#10;was young.  They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother--a&#10;mother once--among the weeping train.  But the sun shone brightly, and&#10;the birds sang on.&#10;&#10;Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received&#10;from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that&#10;he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.  He&#10;had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of&#10;thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred&#10;little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have&#10;been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.  We need&#10;be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to&#10;some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so&#10;little done--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might&#10;have been repaired!

God forbid!' exclaimed Oliver, hastily.&#10;&#10;'Amen to that, my child!' said the old lady, wringing her hands.&#10;&#10;'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?' said Oliver. 'Two&#10;hours ago, she was quite well.'&#10;&#10;'She is very ill now,' rejoined Mrs. Maylies; 'and will be worse, I am&#10;sure.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without her!'&#10;&#10;She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own&#10;emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,&#10;for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.&#10;&#10;'And consider, ma'am,' said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into&#10;his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary.

This done, the postboy drove off;&#10;Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.&#10;&#10;As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much&#10;interest and curiosity at the new comer.  He seemed about&#10;five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his&#10;countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and&#10;prepossessing.  Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age,&#10;he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have&#10;had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not&#10;already spoken of her as his mother.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached&#10;the cottage.  The meeting did not take place without great emotion on&#10;both sides.&#10;&#10;'Mother!' whispered the young man; 'why did you not write before?'&#10;&#10;'I did,' replied Mrs. Maylie; 'but, on reflection, I determined to keep&#10;back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne's opinion.'&#10;&#10;'" />
    <node id=" bless us&#10;all for many years to come.  I heard him say so.'&#10;&#10;The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the&#10;beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,&#10;and remained silent, for some minutes.  Oliver thought he heard him&#10;sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh&#10;remark--for he could well guess what his feelings were--and so stood&#10;apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.&#10;&#10;All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting&#10;on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and&#10;wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with&#10;white spots.  That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was&#10;abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the&#10;young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.&#10;&#10;'I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, Giles,'&#10;said he.  'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time&#10;before I see her" />
    <node id=".  Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one&#10;of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.&#10;&#10;There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and&#10;mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the&#10;summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering&#10;overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy&#10;raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively&#10;occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could&#10;surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that&#10;graves were for cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and&#10;fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and&#10;shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in&#10;their ghastly folds.&#10;&#10;A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.&#10;Another!  Again!  It was tolling for the funeral service.  A group of&#10;humble mourners entered the gate: wearing" />

I am sure--certain--quite certain--that, for your sake, who&#10;are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she&#10;makes so happy; she will not die.  Heaven will never let her die so&#10;young.'&#10;&#10;'Hush!' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver's head. 'You think&#10;like a child, poor boy.  But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.  I&#10;had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,&#10;for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the&#10;agony of separation from the objects of our love.  I have seen enough,&#10;too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared&#10;to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow;&#10;for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively," />
    <node id="The potential consequences for a man who marries a woman with a stained reputation, as described in the narrative, include being subjected to coldness, scorn, and sneers from sordid people. This would be in exact proportion to his success in the world, increasing with every achievement. His generous and good nature could be questioned due to this connection, causing mental anguish and regret.&#10;&#10;In this scenario, the son, Harry, responds to his mother's warning by expressing his deep and lasting devotion for Rose Maylie. He emphasizes that his feelings have not changed over the years and insists on declaring his love before it is too late. Despite Mrs. Maylie's hesitation due to a stain on Rose's reputation, Harry remains firm in his decision, expressing his willingness to face any potential negative consequences from society.&#10;&#10;In summary, the potential consequences for marrying a woman with a stained reputation include social scorn and derision, but the son in this scenario is determined to pursue his feelings for Rose regardless of these possible repercussions." />

The former now held&#10;out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged&#10;between them.  The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious&#10;questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's&#10;situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as&#10;Oliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of&#10;which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened&#10;with greedy ears.&#10;&#10;'Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?' inquired the&#10;doctor, when he had concluded.&#10;" />

You understand me?'&#10;&#10;'Oh! quite, sir, quite,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;'I would rather you did not mention it to them,' said Harry, hurrying&#10;over his words; 'because it might make my mother anxious to write to me&#10;oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret&#10;between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!  I depend upon&#10;you.'&#10;&#10;Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,&#10;faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.&#10;Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and&#10;protection.&#10;&#10;The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should&#10;be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants&#10;were in the garden, looking on.  Harry cast one slight glance at the&#10;latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.&#10;&#10;'Drive on!' he cried," />
    <node id="The church bell is tolling to signify that a funeral service is about to begin, and a group of humble mourners are entering the church gate to attend the service. Given the context of the passage, it is clear that the funeral service is for Rose, who is gravely ill at this point in the story. The mourners are wearing white favors, which traditionally signify mourning for a young person. One of the mourners is described as &quot;a mother--a mother once&quot; which suggests that she has lost a child and is now mourning the loss of Rose." />
    <node id=" I see how Rose goes on, I&#10;scarcely know.  I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.'&#10;&#10;'Is it for Chertsey, too, ma'am?' inquired Oliver; impatient to execute&#10;his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.&#10;&#10;'No,' replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver&#10;glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,&#10;at some great lord's house in the country; where, he could not make out.&#10;&#10;'Shall it go, ma'am?' asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.&#10;&#10;'I think not,' replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.  'I will wait until&#10;to-morrow.'&#10;&#10;With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,&#10;without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.&#10;&#10;Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which&#10;sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either&#10;side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers&#10;were busy at their work:  nor" />
    <node id="&#10;Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words&#10;had roused her from some painful thoughts.&#10;&#10;'Rose, my love!' cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over&#10;her.  'What is this?  In tears!  My dear child, what distresses you?'&#10;&#10;'Nothing, aunt; nothing,' replied the young lady.  'I don't know what&#10;it is; I can't describe it; but I feel--'&#10;&#10;'Not ill, my love?' interposed Mrs. Maylie.&#10;&#10;'No, no!  Oh, not ill!' replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly&#10;chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; 'I shall be better&#10;presently.  Close the window, pray!'&#10;&#10;Oliver hastened to comply with her request.  The young lady, making an&#10;effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune;&#10;but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with&#10;her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she&#10;was now unable to repress.&#10;&#10;'My child!'" />

I love her; and He knows how well!'&#10;&#10;Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she&#10;checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself&#10;up as she spoke, became composed and firm.  He was still more&#10;astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the&#10;care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and&#10;collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her,&#10;steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.  But he&#10;was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under&#10;trying circumstances.  How should he, when their possessors so seldom&#10;know themselves?&#10;&#10;An anxious night ensued.  When morning came, Mrs. Maylie's predictions&#10;were but too well verified.

And at night, you urge me, with great&#10;mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of&#10;which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when&#10;he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all&#10;kinds. Too bad, isn't it, Oliver?'&#10;&#10;'I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and&#10;Mr. Maylie went away, sir,' rejoined Oliver.&#10;&#10;'That's a fine fellow,' said the doctor; 'you shall come and see me&#10;when you return.  But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication&#10;from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be&#10;gone?'&#10;&#10;'The great nobs,' replied Harry, 'under which designation, I presume,&#10;you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me" />

Before you&#10;stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried&#10;to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,&#10;on Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her&#10;doubtful birth may have on her decision:  devoted as she is to us, with&#10;all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of&#10;self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her&#10;characteristic.'&#10;&#10;'What do you mean?'&#10;&#10;'That I leave you to discover,' replied Mrs. Maylie.  'I must go back&#10;to her.  God bless you!'&#10;&#10;'I shall see you again to-night?' said the young man, eagerly.&#10;&#10;'By and by,' replied the lady; 'when I leave Rose.'&#10;&#10;'You will tell her I am here?' said Harry.&#10;&#10;'Of course,' replied Mrs. Maylie.&#10;&#10;'And" />

But of course they&#10;will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and&#10;these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political&#10;life.  There's something in that.  Good training is always desirable,&#10;whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.'&#10;&#10;Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue&#10;by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a&#10;little; but he contented himself with saying, 'We shall see,' and&#10;pursued the subject no farther.  The post-chaise drove up to the door&#10;shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good&#10;doctor bustled out, to see it packed.&#10;&#10;'Oliver,' said Harry Maylie, in a low" />
    <node id="Oliver's emotional state has changed due to the &quot;joyful change&quot; of learning that the person he had parted from earlier would not abandon him, lifting the burden of anguish he had been carrying. This person's identity is not specified in the narrative, but it is a source of great happiness for Oliver. The news was so overwhelming that he needed to take a long walk in the quiet evening air, where he could process his feelings and eventually experience a &quot;burst of tears&quot; that helped him fully realize the positive transformation in his life." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;It was almost too much happiness to bear.  Oliver felt stunned and&#10;stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,&#10;or rest.  He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had&#10;passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of&#10;tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a&#10;full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost&#10;insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.&#10;&#10;The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward:  laden with&#10;flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of&#10;the sick chamber.  As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind&#10;him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.  Looking&#10;round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as&#10;the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning&#10;against a gate until it should have passed him.&#10;&#10;As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in" />
    <node id="&#10;behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.&#10;&#10;The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for&#10;when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and&#10;to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.&#10;&#10;Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was&#10;delirious.  A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in&#10;constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he&#10;had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a&#10;most alarming nature. 'In fact,' he said, 'it would be little short of&#10;a miracle, if she recovered.'&#10;&#10;How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out,&#10;with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest&#10;sound from the sick chamber!  How often did a tremble shake his frame,&#10;and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling&#10;of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had&#10;even then occurred!  And what had been the fervency of all the prayers&#10;he had ever muttered" />
    <node id="&#10;matter of impossibility to separate the two.  Nor is this, the most&#10;striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.  It is an undoubted&#10;fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,&#10;yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before&#10;us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent&#10;presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when&#10;we closed our eyes:  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking&#10;consciousness.&#10;&#10;Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that&#10;his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was&#10;stirring among the creeping plants outside.  And yet he was asleep.&#10;Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he&#10;thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew's house again.&#10;There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at&#10;him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat&#10;beside him.&#10;&#10;'Hush, my dear!' he thought he heard the Jew say; '" />
    <node id="ady's chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer&#10;air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always&#10;stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch,&#10;which was made up with great care, every morning.  Oliver could not&#10;help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away,&#10;although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help&#10;observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably&#10;cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most&#10;expressively, as he set forth on his morning's walk.  Pending these&#10;observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.&#10;&#10;Nor did Oliver's time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady&#10;had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now&#10;and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself,&#10;with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old&#10;gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even&#10;himself.  It was while he was engaged in" />
    <node id="Rose's condition is that she has fallen ill and is in the first stage of a high fever. She becomes emotional and tearful, expressing feelings of distress that she cannot describe. Mrs. Maylie reacts with great grief and sorrow, lamenting the potential loss of her dear companion. However, when she notices Rose's distress, she quickly checks her own emotions and becomes composed and firm, performing all necessary duties steadily and even cheerfully. This surprises Oliver, who is young and unaware of the strength that mature minds can display under trying circumstances. The situation causes Mrs. Maylie to fear for Rose's life, but she tries to remain calm and supportive for her niece's sake." />
    <node id=" she was once more deadly&#10;pale.&#10;&#10;Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was&#10;alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that&#10;she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and&#10;they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to&#10;retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in&#10;better health:  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in&#10;the morning, quite well.&#10;&#10;'I hope,' said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, 'that nothing is the&#10;matter?  She don't look well to-night, but--'&#10;&#10;The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in&#10;a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length,&#10;she said, in a trembling voice:&#10;&#10;'I hope not, Oliver.  I have been very happy with her for some years:&#10;too happy, perhaps.  It may be time that I should meet with some&#10;misfortune; but I hope it is not this.'&#10;&#10;'What?' inquired Oliver." />
    <node id="1. The man's intense anger and strange behavior towards Oliver is due to his belief that Oliver's reappearance has brought misfortune upon him. The man implies that he had the opportunity to free himself from Oliver, but didn't have the courage to take action. He curses Oliver before falling into a fit. This strange behavior can be attributed to the man's obsession with revenge and his association of Oliver with past hardships.&#10;   &#10;2. Oliver quickly forgets this encounter because when he reaches home, he finds Rose Maylie's condition has worsened significantly. His concern for her and the urgency of the situation replace any thoughts or fears related to the strange man. The severity of Rose Maylie's illness takes precedence in his mind, pushing the earlier unsettling encounter to the background.&#10;&#10;In this narrative, Oliver encounters a man filled with intense anger and hatred, who then falls into a fit after their brief interaction. This strange behavior stems from the man's belief that Oliver is somehow connected to misfortune and past hardships in his life. Ultimately, however, the urgency of Rose Maylie's illness causes Oliver to forget this unsettling encounter quickly." />
    <node id=", with his face averted, who sat&#10;beside him.&#10;&#10;'Hush, my dear!' he thought he heard the Jew say; 'it is he, sure&#10;enough.  Come away.'&#10;&#10;'He!' the other man seemed to answer; 'could I mistake him, think you?&#10;If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and&#10;he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to&#10;point him out.  If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across&#10;his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn't a mark above it, that&#10;he lay buried there?'&#10;&#10;The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver&#10;awoke with the fear, and started up.&#10;&#10;Good Heaven!  what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his&#10;heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move!&#10;There--there--at the window--close before him--so close, that he could&#10;have almost touched him before he started back:  with his eyes peering&#10;into the room, and meeting his:  there stood the Jew!  And beside him" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Oliver is in a desperate state of impatience and anxiety as he waits for assistance to reach Rose Maylie, who has fallen ill. He feels so distressed that he believes he could have galloped away on a horse himself to bring help more quickly. This situation highlights Oliver's care and concern for Rose Maylie, emphasizing his emotional attachment to the kind-hearted character in the story. After the gentleman leaves with the parcel, Oliver hurries back home with a somewhat lighter heart, hoping that help is on its way. The intensity of the situation also illustrates the strong bond between Oliver and Mrs. Maylie, as well as Oliver's growing maturity under stressful circumstances." />

'You are sure?'&#10;&#10;'Quite, sir,' replied Oliver.  'The change took place only a few hours&#10;ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.'&#10;&#10;The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,&#10;leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.&#10;&#10;'You are quite certain?  There is no possibility of any mistake on your&#10;part, my boy, is there?' demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.&#10;'Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.'&#10;&#10;'I would not for the world, sir,' replied Oliver.  'Indeed you may&#10;believe me.  Mr. Losberne's words were, that she would live to bless us&#10;all for many years to come.  I heard him say so.'&#10;&#10;The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he recalled the scene which" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it can be inferred that while Rose Maylie is happy to see Harry Maylie, her close friend, in high spirits and seemingly joyful, she also seems to be experiencing emotions related to sorrow. This is evident from the tears that course down her face as she gazes in the same direction as the departed carriage, even after it has traveled many miles away. Despite her gladness for Harry's happiness, her own feelings are more indicative of sadness or melancholy, possibly due to his upcoming departure and the revelation about his true feelings towards her." />

'Say but that, dear Rose; say&#10;but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!'&#10;&#10;'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,'&#10;rejoined Rose, 'I could have--'&#10;&#10;'Have received this declaration very differently?' said Harry. 'Do not&#10;conceal that from me, at least, Rose.'&#10;&#10;'I could,' said Rose.  'Stay!' she added, disengaging her hand, 'why&#10;should we prolong this painful interview?  Most painful to me, and yet&#10;productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be&#10;happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which&#10;I now occupy, and" />
    <node id="Rose Maylie rejects Harry's love declaration not because she doesn't have feelings for him, but rather due to her sense of duty towards another person whom she loves. Although the text does not explicitly name this person, it is heavily implied that Rose is referring to her previously deceased lover, who was involved in some criminal activity and may have been connected to her &quot;stained reputation.&quot; Therefore, despite her own feelings for Harry, Rose feels that accepting his love declaration would be wrong towards the other man she once loved." />
    <node id="based on the description provided, Rose's condition is that she has fallen ill and is experiencing symptoms associated with a high fever. These symptoms include a &quot;marble whiteness&quot; of her countenance, an anxious haggard look, and changes in her complexion such as heavy wildness and crimson flushes, followed by more paleness. The elderly lady, who is Rose's aunt, is concerned about her condition because these symptoms suggest that Rose is gravely ill, potentially with a life-threatening fever. The aunt tries to remain calm and supportive for Rose's sake, but she is clearly worried about the situation." />

I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.'&#10;&#10;She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the&#10;very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of&#10;her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had&#10;lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an&#10;anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn&#10;before.  Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:  and&#10;a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.  Again this disappeared,&#10;like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly&#10;pale.&#10;&#10;Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was&#10;alarmed by these appearances" />
    <node id="Yes, based on the narrative, if Rose and Harry's circumstances had been different and Rose could have been a help to him in a peaceful and retired life, she would have been spared the trial of being separated from him for his happiness. This is because Rose expresses that she would have been happier if she could have been a help and comfort to Harry, rather than a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds. However, due to her own situation and sense of duty towards her previously deceased lover, she feels unable to accept Harry's love declaration." />

I have every reason to be happy,&#10;very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.'&#10;&#10;Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded&#10;into the mind of Rose," />

Men&#10;who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and&#10;gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from&#10;their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.  The real hues are delicate, and&#10;need a clearer vision.&#10;&#10;It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,&#10;that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,&#10;after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was&#10;seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in&#10;their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.  If Oliver&#10;were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be&#10;found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and&#10;brought home the fairest that blossomed.  The window of the young&#10;lady's chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer&#10;air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always&#10;" />
    <node id="The man at the window is a friend of Oliver's who had previously encountered the Jew, Sikes, in an inn-yard. He is able to recognize the Jew with such certainty because he says that even if a crowd of ghosts put themselves into the Jew's exact shape and he stood among them, he would still be able to recognize him. The man's hatred for the Jew is so strong that he believes he would recognize him even if he was buried and lying beneath an unmarked grave. This shows the deep-seated animosity the man feels towards the Jew." />

And beside him,&#10;white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man&#10;who had accosted him in the inn-yard.&#10;&#10;It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they&#10;were gone.  But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look&#10;was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply&#10;carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed&#10;for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called&#10;loudly for help.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to&#10;the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,&#10;pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely&#10;able to articulate the words, 'The Jew! the Jew!'&#10;&#10;Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry&#10;Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard&#10;" />

In another second or two, the&#10;nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice&#10;bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he did, as soon as he could pull&#10;up his horses.  Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same&#10;voice called Oliver by his name.&#10;&#10;'Here!' cried the voice.  'Oliver, what's the news?  Miss Rose! Master&#10;O-li-ver!'&#10;&#10;'Is it you, Giles?' cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.&#10;&#10;Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,&#10;when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the&#10;other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.&#10;&#10;'In a word!' cried the gentleman, 'Better or worse?'&#10;&#10;'Better--" />
    <node id="Mr. Giles discussed with the doctor the topic of a &quot;small commission&quot; that the doctor had executed for Mrs. Maylie's favor. The details of this commission were not disclosed, but it was significant enough for Mr. Giles to have an important and whispered conversation with the doctor in the corner.&#10;&#10;After their conference, Mr. Giles made a significant announcement to the kitchen staff regarding a sum of money deposited in the local savings-bank for his benefit. The amount of the deposit was twenty-five pounds, which Mrs. Maylie had given him as a reward for his gallant behavior during an attempted robbery at their residence. This generous act by Mrs. Maylie was in recognition of Mr. Giles' loyalty and bravery, further highlighting his importance in her household." />
    <node id="  Just step into this corner a moment, will&#10;you?'&#10;&#10;Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,&#10;and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on&#10;the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with&#10;steps of unusual stateliness.  The subject matter of this conference&#10;was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily&#10;enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and&#10;having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty,&#10;which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in&#10;consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that&#10;attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of&#10;five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.  At this, the two&#10;women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr.&#10;Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, 'No, no'; and that if they&#10;observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank&#10;them to tell him" />

Pray, how is Brittles?'&#10;&#10;'The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone&#10;of patronage; 'and sends his respectful duty, sir.'&#10;&#10;'That's well,' said the doctor.  'Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.&#10;Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so&#10;hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small&#10;commission in your favour.

    <node id="The speaker, who is not explicitly named in the narrative but could be Rose's aunt, experiences a range of emotions when she fears that Rose may pass away due to her grave illness. These emotions include worry, anxiety, and sadness. The description of Rose's symptoms, such as the &quot;marble whiteness&quot; of her countenance, anxious haggard look, and changes in her complexion, all suggest a serious condition that could potentially be life-threatening.&#10;&#10;The speaker tries to remain calm and supportive for Rose's sake, but it is clear that she is deeply concerned about her health. She listens to the church bell tolling, which signals a funeral service, and sees a group of humble mourners entering the church gate to attend the service. Given the context of the passage, it is implied that the funeral service is for Rose, which adds to the speaker's anxiety and sadness.&#10;&#10;When Rose begins to recover from her illness, the speaker's emotions shift from worry and sadness to relief and happiness. The text states that &quot;the bright cheerful face was restored&quot; and &quot;that the danger was past.&quot; This recovery not only means that Rose will survive but also that she and Harry Maylie can be together without any obstacles.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that even though Rose recovers, there are still unresolved issues between her and Harry. Specifically, Harry wants to reveal his intentions to her before he departs, but Mrs. Maylie advises him to consider the potential impact of Rose learning about her doubtful birth. Therefore, while the speaker's emotions have improved due to Rose's recovery, there are still challenges that the characters must face in the narrative." />
    <node id="Mrs. Maylie suggests that Harry consider the potential social impact and consequences if he decides to pursue a relationship with Rose, given her doubtful birth. If they were to marry, Harry might be subjected to coldness, scorn, and sneers from sordid people, which would increase in exact proportion to his success in the world. His generous and good nature could be questioned due to this connection, causing him mental anguish and regret. The revelation of Rose's doubtful birth plays a significant role in this, as it may negatively affect Harry's reputation and standing in society, making it a crucial factor for him to consider before &quot;staking his all&quot; on his hope for a relationship with her." />
    <node id="The favor that the doctor executed for Mr. Giles's mistress was depositing a sum of money in the local savings-bank for Mr. Giles's benefit. The doctor asked to speak with Mr. Giles in private about it to discuss the details of this transaction, which were not disclosed in the narrative. This favor was given to Mr. Giles as a reward for his loyalty and bravery, highlighting his importance in Mrs. Maylie's household." />
    <node id="Mrs. Maylie decides to withhold Rose's letter from Harry because she wants to consult their family doctor, Mr. Losberne, regarding the potential impact of Rose learning about her doubtful birth before sharing this information with Harry. Mrs. Maylie is concerned that if Harry were to pursue a relationship with Rose, his reputation and standing in society might be negatively affected by her questionable background. By waiting for the doctor's opinion on Rose's health, Mrs. Maylie ensures that it would be safe for her son to come home and see Rose, who is clearly important to him.&#10;&#10;This action reveals that Mrs. Maylie highly values and respects both Harry and Rose, understanding the gravity of their feelings for each other. She wants to protect them from potential harm, including social consequences and emotional distress, by carefully considering the timing and circumstances under which they learn about Rose's background. By waiting for the doctor's advice, Mrs. Maylie demonstrates her thoughtfulness and care for both Rose and Harry, recognizing the depth of love they deserve and aiming to preserve their happiness as much as possible." />
    <node id="Ady, possibly a sick patient in the cottage, enjoys feeling the summer air stream into her chamber. She keeps a bunch of withered flowers just inside the lattice, which she refreshes every morning with great care. Oliver notices that the doctor always casts his eyes up to that particular corner, where the withered flowers are kept, and nods his head expressively whenever he comes into the garden. This indicates that the bunch of withered flowers might have some special significance or connection to Ady's health or recovery. The doctor seems to be keeping a close eye on her progress through this ritual." />
    <node id=" and fever of the time,&#10;allay them!&#10;&#10;Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke&#10;in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;&#10;women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for&#10;hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the&#10;garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and&#10;shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay&#10;stretched inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.  'It is&#10;hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; 'so young; so&#10;much beloved; but there is very little hope.'&#10;&#10;Another morning.  The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked&#10;upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom&#10;about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,&#10;surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting&#10;fast.  Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one&#10;of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence" />
    <node id="1. From Oliver's perspective, he gains insight into the significant impact that a young and good person can have on those around them. When Rose Maylie falls ill, Oliver is in a state of distress and anxiety, revealing his deep emotional attachment to her. After attending the funeral of an unnamed young lady who had shown him kindness, he reflects on the value of kindness and friendship, recognizing how one individual can greatly affect another's life.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Maylie responds to Oliver's plea with compassion and understanding. She acknowledges her own emotions related to illness and death, revealing that she has seen enough in her life to know the agony of separation from loved ones. At the same time, she teaches Oliver a lesson about hope and acceptance in the face of loss.&#10;&#10;3. Mrs. Maylie also reflects on the concept of heavenly justice, recognizing that illness and death affect people indiscriminately. She understands that even the youngest and best individuals may not be spared from suffering, but she finds comfort in knowing that such events remind us of the importance of being mindful of our relationships and actions." />
    <node id="1. The man in the white nightcap is Giles, a friend of Oliver's who had previously encountered the criminal, Sikes, in an inn-yard. He recognizes the Jew with such certainty because he believes that even if a crowd of ghosts put themselves into the Jew's exact shape and he stood among them, he would still be able to recognize him. The man's intense hatred for the Jew is what drives his strong reaction to seeing him again.&#10;2. Giles reveals to Oliver that Miss Rose has fallen ill and is in the first stage of a high fever. She becomes emotional and tearful, expressing feelings of distress that she cannot describe. Mrs. Maylie reacts with great grief and sorrow, lamenting the potential loss of her dear companion. However, when she notices Rose's distress, she quickly checks her own emotions and becomes composed and firm, performing all necessary duties steadily and even cheerfully to support her niece during this trying time." />

There were a white bank,&#10;and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was&#10;a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:  before which&#10;was the sign of 'The George.'  To this he hastened, as soon as it&#10;caught his eye.&#10;&#10;He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after&#10;hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing&#10;all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall&#10;gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots&#10;with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking&#10;his" />
    <node id="Ꮇo, there has been no pressure or communication from his uncle or other noble relatives regarding his departure. Harry Maylie's decision to leave is driven by his own feelings and his desire to speak with Rose Maylie before leaving the area. He wants to reveal his intentions to her before he departs, but Mrs. Maylie advises him to consider the potential impact of Rose learning about her doubtful birth. Therefore, Harry's urgency to leave is not due to any pressure from high-ranking individuals but his personal feelings and intentions towards Rose Maylie." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is important to clarify that Harry does not accuse Rose of rejecting him; rather, he acknowledges the factors influencing her decision. Here are the factors according to Harry:&#10;&#10;1. Doubtful birth: Harry understands that Rose's concern about her doubtful birth and its potential impact on his reputation plays a significant role in her decision. He is aware that marrying her might expose him to coldness, scorn, and sneers from sordid people, which could negatively affect his standing in society.&#10;2. Sense of duty: Rose's sense of duty towards another person she once loved, possibly connected to her stained reputation, also contributes to her rejection. Although the text does not explicitly name this person, it is heavily implied that Rose is referring to her previously deceased lover.&#10;&#10;Rose does not directly respond to Harry's acknowledgment of these factors. However, she indirectly addresses them when expressing her feelings and reasons for rejecting his love declaration. She wishes she could have been a help and comfort to him in a peaceful and retired life instead of being a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds. Her decision stems from her sense of duty towards her previously deceased lover and the desire to avoid causing harm to Harry's reputation and happiness." />
    <node id="Mrs. Maylie is worried about Rose's health because she has fallen ill with symptoms associated with a high fever, such as a marble-like whiteness of her face, anxious haggard looks, changes in complexion, and bouts of paleness. She fears that this illness may be life-threatening. Additionally, Mrs. Maylie is concerned about Harry's desire to reveal his intentions to Rose before he leaves the area, worrying that learning about her doubtful birth might affect her emotionally at a time when she is already physically vulnerable. The misfortune Mrs. Maylie fears has come to them may not only be Rose's illness but also the potential emotional turmoil that Harry's revelation might bring upon her." />

Still, in no direction were there any&#10;appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.

'Blathers and Duff, themselves, could&#10;make nothing of it.'&#10;&#10;Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did&#10;not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further&#10;prosecution hopeless; and even then,">

This is because Rose expresses that she would have been happier if she could have been a help and comfort to Harry, rather than a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds. However, due to her own situation and sense of duty towards her previously deceased lover, she feels unable to accept Harry's love declaration.">

Mrs. Maylie reacts with great grief and sorrow, lamenting the potential loss of her dear companion. However, when she notices Rose's distress, she quickly checks her own emotions and becomes composed and firm, performing all necessary duties steadily and even cheerfully. This surprises Oliver, who is young and unaware of the strength that mature minds can display under trying circumstances. The situation causes Mrs. Maylie to fear for Rose's life, but she tries to remain calm and supportive for her niece's sake.">

The doctor seems to be keeping a close eye on her progress through this ritual." target=" and fever of the time,&#10;allay them!&#10;&#10;Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke&#10;in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;&#10;women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for&#10;hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the&#10;garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and&#10;shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay&#10;stretched inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.  'It is&#10;hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; 'so young; so&#10;much beloved; but there is very little hope.'&#10;&#10;Another morning.  The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked&#10;upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom&#10;about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,&#10;surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting&#10;fast.  Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one&#10;of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence">

There were a white bank,&#10;and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was&#10;a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:  before which&#10;was the sign of 'The George.'  To this he hastened, as soon as it&#10;caught his eye.&#10;&#10;He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after&#10;hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing&#10;all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall&#10;gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots&#10;with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking&#10;his">

Harry Maylie's decision to leave is driven by his own feelings and his desire to speak with Rose Maylie before leaving the area. He wants to reveal his intentions to her before he departs, but Mrs. Maylie advises him to consider the potential impact of Rose learning about her doubtful birth. Therefore, Harry's urgency to leave is not due to any pressure from high-ranking individuals but his personal feelings and intentions towards Rose Maylie." target="Based on the narrative, it is important to clarify that Harry does not accuse Rose of rejecting him; rather, he acknowledges the factors influencing her decision. Here are the factors according to Harry:&#10;&#10;1. Doubtful birth: Harry understands that Rose's concern about her doubtful birth and its potential impact on his reputation plays a significant role in her decision. He is aware that marrying her might expose him to coldness, scorn, and sneers from sordid people, which could negatively affect his standing in society.&#10;2. Sense of duty: Rose's sense of duty towards another person she once loved, possibly connected to her stained reputation, also contributes to her rejection. Although the text does not explicitly name this person, it is heavily implied that Rose is referring to her previously deceased lover.&#10;&#10;Rose does not directly respond to Harry's acknowledgment of these factors. However, she indirectly addresses them when expressing her feelings and reasons for rejecting his love declaration. She wishes she could have been a help and comfort to him in a peaceful and retired life instead of being a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds. Her decision stems from her sense of duty towards her previously deceased lover and the desire to avoid causing harm to Harry's reputation and happiness.">

    <node id="1. The National Centre for Learning Welsh is working with stakeholders in the early years, childcare, and play sectors through a stakeholder group that includes individuals and organizations interested in these fields. They recently had a presentation from the national language center about the education programs they are rolling out to bring together various work-based learning programs available in Welsh and bilingually.&#10;2. Developing Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce is crucial due to the challenges of recruiting and retaining staff with strong Welsh language skills, which Mudiad Meithrin emphasizes regularly. To address this issue, upskilling the existing workforce is essential, along with attracting people with Welsh language skills during recruitment and considering this in the context of Cymraeg 2050's targets and the aim to reach one million Welsh speakers.&#10;3. The National Centre for Learning Welsh is also working on incorporating Welsh language skills development into early years care training, ensuring that trainees have at least some basic Welsh language skills from their education. This approach aims to provide a strong foundation in Welsh language skills for those who will be teaching and interacting with children in Welsh or bilingual settings." />
    <node id=" Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to—&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any  case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff" />
    <node id=" CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. So, we have got the system of inspection to ensure that.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the" />
    <node id=" extra dimension to it, and that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education" />
    <node id=", you've got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on?&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, but the majority, being realistic.&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has" />
    <node id=" then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps—we see this quite a lot in the office—quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training.&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer" />
    <node id=" your focus is to change that and move towards early child development?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. So, we see it as one.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. And that's quite a policy challenge to deliver both at the same time.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it’s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government’s approach 'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.' And you've just said you" />
    <node id="1. Encourage Take-up through Local Campaigns: Since the decision to attend parenting courses is largely local and decided by parents, efforts can be made to increase awareness about the benefits and importance of these courses in Flying Start areas. This could involve local campaigns, partnerships with community organizations, and targeted outreach to families with young children.&#10;&#10;2. Collect Data on Reasons for Non-participation: Currently, there is a lack of information on why parents are not taking up the offer of informal parenting courses. Gathering this data would help tailor strategies to address specific barriers to participation, such as lack of awareness, accessibility issues, or concerns about the content and format of the courses.&#10;&#10;3. Offer Flexible Formats: To cater to different learning styles and preferences, consider offering a variety of course formats, including online, self-paced, and in-person sessions. This can help reduce barriers for parents who may find traditional classroom settings unappealing or inconvenient.&#10;&#10;4. Increase Awareness about the Role of Health Visitors: Emphasize the significant role of health visitors in providing enhanced parenting support to all parents in Flying Start areas. By highlighting the practical and emotional benefits of engaging with health visitors, more parents may be encouraged to participate in available parenting courses or seek guidance from professionals.&#10;&#10;5. Consider Extending Flying Start Benefits: The Welsh Government is currently looking into making Flying Start more accessible to more children beyond the current pathfinder areas. By extending these benefits to a larger population, more families can potentially benefit from informal parenting courses and other support services.&#10;&#10;6. Promote Informal Parenting Support: Recognize that not all parents may prefer or require formal parenting courses, and that informal support from professionals can be impactful. Encourage health visitors, childcare workers, and other relevant professionals to provide advice, guidance, and top tips in a friendly and approachable manner, as this may be more appealing to some parents." />
    <node id=" Flying Start beneficiaries—it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course—we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, the reach of this is going to" />
    <node id="'ve got any more evidence on that for take-up—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes.&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales" />
    <node id="’s where we’re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. So, we do want to extend the benefits of Flying Start. We do want to make it available to more children, and that’s what we’re looking at. And we’re looking at that in those eight pathfinder areas. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: No, no—we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Do we know why?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, the approach that we’ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start—. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you’re familiar with the work that, as I say, we’ve been doing with SAIL. We’re currently focusing on individual data collection" />
    <node id=" in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting—again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That" />
    <node id=": Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but—&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. That equates to about 23 per cent of children, overall, in Wales. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is—basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of" />
    <node id=" assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. I feel that we should be offering something for all children, and our considerations are for all children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have" />
    <node id="1. Geographic boundaries being considered: The text suggests that the Welsh Government is considering expanding the geographical boundaries of the Flying Start program. However, specific details about the new boundaries are not provided in the transcript.&#10;2. Flexibility beyond boundaries with limits: Currently, Flying Start services can extend beyond their designated geographical areas, but this is done with limitations. The 10% rule mentioned indicates that only up to 10% of Flying Start's income can be used to support activities or initiatives outside of these targeted zones.&#10;3. Geographic targeting based on benefit take-up: The current geographic boundaries for Flying Start are determined by the level of benefit claims in specific areas. This targets support to reach some of the poorest children, although not all disadvantaged children are covered due to the arbitrary nature of these boundaries." />
    <node id=" we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because I think Flying Start has proved to be a great—very successful.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I'm going to ask you a few more questions on that. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government’s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: With limits, yes.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the" />
    <node id=" the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. We're looking at this.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I accept what you say about the current system—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I believe it's much more—. I believe very strongly in having a universal system, where everybody is able to access it.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I appreciate that as well. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that—unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children—on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but" />
    <node id=" I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. So, again, that determines the pattern throughout Wales. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Before you move on, Janet, Siân's got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Just in terms of the foundation phase" />
    <node id="?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so,in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. So, I think that there is a purpose behind that. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: I know that—we've just had a useful briefing from David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources—the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: It is demand—&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: [Inaudible.]—because the offer is targeted at working parents—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-" />
    <node id="1. The review of the childcare offer is expected to report sometime next year, as confirmed by Nicola Edwards. However, a specific timeline has not been set yet.&#10;2. Regarding the assertion that children from disadvantaged backgrounds do better in mixed socioeconomic environments compared to targeted ones, Julie Morgan AM indicated that Flying Start, a program targeting disadvantaged areas, likely provides a mixed socioeconomic environment for children. She believes offering something for all children is essential while focusing on the needs of disadvantaged children. This aligns with Suzy Davies AM's suggestion to change the outreach system to better target disadvantaged children and avoid capturing those who don't fit the criteria just because they live in a targeted geographic area." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Would we have any idea?&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. But sometime next year.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, it will report sometime next year.&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We'll move on now to Flying Start and questions from Suzy Davies.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I" />
    <node id=" Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture.&#10;Speaker: Julie" />
    <node id=" Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. I take that point. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: No, I'm not surprised at all. When it started off, it was only available in seven local authorities. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. So it was absolutely what we would have expected, and that will continue. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to" />
    <node id=" Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about £81 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, I mean, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within 'Prosperity for All' and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. But it's still very early to think about, at this stage, a structural change.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David" />
    <node id=" at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Oh dear. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: That's absolutely unforgivable. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Hefin. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Very significant.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: In your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery" />
    <node id="The elected officials, specifically Sian Gwenllian AM and Janet Finch-Saunders AM, expressed concern over potential impacts on standards of learning in the foundation phase due to funding cuts. However, Julie Morgan AM stated that she hasn't seen any evidence of lowering standards so far and wants to guard against it, citing positive reports from Estyn. The concern is mainly about fewer teaching assistants in the system due to cuts, which could impact standards according to Sian Gwenllian AM." />
    <node id=", Janet, Siân's got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. I would want to guard against that.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. I would want to guard against that.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas.

    <node id=" AM&#10;Content: Right. Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean, obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on" />
    <node id=" extending it to parents who are in education and training. So, we are widening the offer, yes. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation of that. It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. But we are certainly planning to expand it.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've got questions on the offer in a little while. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive" />
    <node id=" I don't think that would be feasible, and,for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. It's whether it's good for children as well. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. I've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Right. Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean, obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency" />

The National Centre for Learning Welsh is working on a specific program to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce, focusing on upskilling existing staff and attracting new employees with Welsh language skills (point 2 and Nicola Edwards' statements).&#10;2. Mudiad Meithrin emphasizes the challenges of recruiting and retaining staff with strong Welsh language skills (Nicola Edwards' statements).&#10;3. The early years care training will incorporate Welsh language skills development, ensuring that trainees have at least basic Welsh language skills upon completing their education (point 3 and Nicola Edwards' statements).&#10;4. Challenges faced in recruiting and retaining staff with good Welsh language skills include the overall difficulty of recruitment and retention in the childcare and play sector, as well as finding staff with appropriate Welsh language skills for teaching and interacting with children from non-Welsh speaking homes (Nicola Edwards' statements).&#10;5. There is a need to ensure that staff can confidently transmit the Welsh language to children, which involves training in child development, bilingual education methods, and language choices (Nicola Edwards' statements)." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is aware of the variation in take-up rates for the childcare offer across different local authorities, which can be attributed to historical differences in how early education has been provided by local authorities. Some local authorities have traditionally offered more than the minimum 10 hours of foundation phase for three and four-year-olds, resulting in a varied landscape.&#10;2. In response to the question about addressing variation and meeting increased demand for funding, the Welsh Government is planning to extend the childcare offer to parents who are in education and training. This expansion aims to widen the scope of the program and cater to more potential beneficiaries. However, there has been no explicit mention of additional funding specifically earmarked for local authorities with higher demand or lower take-up rates.&#10;3. Furthermore, a pilot project is underway in Flint, aiming to test the concept of paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare provision. The results of this independent evaluation could potentially inform future policy decisions regarding funding and addressing regional variations." />
    <node id=" on? Siân's got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Just a question on funding for the childcare offer. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of £50 million to £55 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of £40 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys Môn, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. We are managing it within the normal" />
    <node id=".&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys Môn was nearly 90 per cent or something—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So does everywhere.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: No, to meet the demand.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: In other areas, it's much, much lower—in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We are planning to extend it. We're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training. So, we are widening the offer, yes. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation of" />
    <node id=", Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of £5.6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I think there was also another—. I only heard it verbally. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. I don't know whether anybody else heard that. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are" />
    <node id="The speakers suggest that working with local authorities instead of HMRC would be more cost-effective and flexible for delivering the Welsh offer because the costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had been originally outlined. Additionally, they argue that a system run by local authorities would provide value for money, as the investment made in developing the national system would stay within Wales and support local authority employees, rather than HMRC employees who may be based outside of Wales.&#10;&#10;It is also mentioned that using local authorities would allow for greater flexibility, as certain aspects of the offer, such as training and education or dealing with foster parents and people of a specific immigration status, could not be handled by HMRC and would need to be done by local authorities. Finally, it is noted that there were technical reasons related to Welsh language standards that made using HMRC more difficult than anticipated." />
    <node id=", there are other things with using HMRC—if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. So, we wanted something more flexible. I don't know if there's anything more you want to add on that.&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: The only thing I'd add is that—and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this—the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that—that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them" />
    <node id=" costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures.&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: Yes, we would be very happy to share more detail on that.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Siân.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. That doesn't mean that there's no administration. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of—&#10;Speaker: S" />
    <node id=" the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. There were some issues about that. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: One of the major reasons, I think—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. Good.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: But there are—. As I say, there are other reasons. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Do you want to add something to this?" />
    <node id=" economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation. Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. That grant is ring-fenced to that purpose.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Could you give us an idea of the price tag?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: At the moment, it's about £2.5 million.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, just as a round figure—that's fine.&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Just for the administration. They get separate funding for the childcare, obviously.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there—&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: —and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was—. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Foster parents have to be done via the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. And with the local authorities also wanting to do it—. I mean, there are other things with using HMRC—if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with" />
    <node id=", the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option—and this is only going back a few months—because it will remove—and this is quoting them— 'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'— blah, blah, blah, blah. So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know—. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence—we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think, during the period since it" />
    <node id="1. Maintaining Standards: Speakers Julie Morgan AM, Jo-Anne Daniels, and Lynne Neagle AM expressed concern about maintaining standards in early childhood education and care provision in Wales. They highlighted the importance of upholding the philosophy of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings through joint inspections by CIW and Estyn. They want to ensure that there is no drop in standards, especially since the foundation phase was groundbreaking when introduced and has proven successful.&#10;2. Impact of Budget Cuts: Sian Gwenllian AM and Julie Morgan AM mentioned the potential impact of budget cuts on early childhood education and care provision, specifically in relation to teaching assistants. They cautioned that lower standards might be implemented if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system, which could negatively affect the quality of education.&#10;3. Accessibility: Janet Finch-Saunders AM raised concerns about significant differences in early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales. She questioned whether the current demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents, is the right strategy. She suggested that more universal availability might be a better approach to increasing accessibility in various regions of Wales." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence this morning. Can I ask if there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. Thank you all for your attendance. We’re very much looking forward to the session. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Good morning, Deputy Minister. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it’s important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show" />
    <node id=" midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. And we've got eight pathfinders. I'll try and remember each of them. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire—and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven—who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical" />
    <node id="1. Extending the childcare offer to parents who are in education and training: The Welsh Government plans to widen the scope of the program by allowing more parents to access it, which could potentially help address variation in take-up rates and increase overall demand for funding. However, there has been no explicit mention of additional funding specifically earmarked for local authorities with higher demand or lower take-up rates.&#10;&#10;2. Pilot project in Flint: The Welsh Government is currently testing a pilot project that aims to pay the same rate for foundation phase and childcare provision in Flint. The results of this independent evaluation could inform future policy decisions regarding funding and addressing regional variations.&#10;&#10;3. No specific measures for local authorities with higher demand or lower take-up rates: There has been no explicit mention of targeted support for local authorities that have higher demand or lower take-up rates, which might make it challenging to address variation in the childcare offer's uptake effectively." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, Julie Morgan AM values a universal system where all children can access support. However, she acknowledges the need to focus on disadvantaged children, which is why programs like Flying Start exist. She agrees with Suzy Davies AM that the current geographic targeting is not precise in reaching only disadvantaged children and wants to avoid capturing those who don't fit the criteria. While she mentions the possibility of extending some elements of Flying Start beyond its current geographical areas, she supports the idea of a more targeted approach to supporting disadvantaged children, without explicitly endorsing changing the outreach system as suggested by Suzy Davies AM." />
    <node id=" because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five—that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas—I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that—? Do you know the actual percentage?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but—&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content" />
    <node id="1. Cost: The costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had been originally outlined, making it more cost-effective to work with local authorities instead.&#10;2. Flexibility: Local authorities can provide greater flexibility in delivering certain aspects of the offer, such as training and education or dealing with specific groups like foster parents and people of a certain immigration status, which cannot be handled by HMRC.&#10;3. Value for Money: An investment made in developing a national system run by local authorities would support local authority employees based in Wales, rather than HMRC employees who may be based outside of Wales. This ensures that the investment stays within Wales.&#10;4. Technical Difficulties with Welsh Language Standards: Although HMRC can provide bilingual services, there were technical issues related to Welsh language standards that made using HMRC more difficult than anticipated. Specifically, HMRC's IT systems had trouble processing special characters in the Welsh alphabet, such as 'ŧo bach'.&#10;5. Principle Decision: The decision to work with local authorities was primarily driven by the desire for a more flexible and expandable offer, rather than any specific technical matters related to Welsh language standards. Going through HMRC would have restricted their ability to expand the offer as needed." />
    <node id="ian AM&#10;Content: Yes. So, thank you for that explanation.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I've got more to say as well.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: It would have restricted us a lot.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes. We knew that from the beginning. I mean, that's, you know—. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. That's been cited as one kind of—. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail—going through HMRC would put limits on that.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. There were some issues about that." />
    <node id=" any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Do you want to add something to this?&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called 'special characters' in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. The HMRC IT system has some issues with that.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there—&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Oh, yes, I completely agree." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: One of the reasons.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem.&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: So, I think it's the point that I was talking about earlier. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning?&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not" />
    <node id="1. Costs for transforming the temporary eligibility checking process: The exact cost of transforming the current temporary eligibility checking process with local authorities into a permanent one is not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, it is implied that this new arrangement would be more cost-effective than the previously proposed HMRC system, which had significantly higher costs. The Welsh Government plans to share more details about the cost estimations when available.&#10;&#10;2. Additional costs for a more flexible system: There is no specific mention of additional costs associated with creating a more flexible system in the provided text. The discussion revolves around making the existing system permanent and working with local authorities instead of HMRC, which is projected to be more cost-effective.&#10;&#10;3. Grant ensuring its use for this purpose: While the exact amount of the grant is not specified, it is mentioned that local authorities currently receive a specific grant to undertake the eligibility checking process. There is no explicit information on how the proposed grant will ensure its use for transforming the system into a permanent arrangement or any measures to confirm that the additional funds will be used exclusively for this purpose.&#10;&#10;In summary, there is no clear answer provided in the text regarding the exact costs of transforming the temporary eligibility checking process with local authorities into a permanent one and the associated additional costs for a more flexible system. Furthermore, there is limited information on how the proposed grant will ensure its use for this purpose." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Ms Daniels, you referred to value for money. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, at the moment, local—. So, two things. Just to start by saying the eligibility checking process is not undertaken by all 22 local authorities.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: No, no, I realise that. Yes, I got all that.&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation. Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that.

The National Centre for Learning Welsh is working on a specific program to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce, focusing on upskilling existing staff and attracting new employees with Welsh language skills. They are doing this through a stakeholder group that includes individuals and organizations interested in early years, childcare, and play sectors.&#10;2. The National Centre for Learning Welsh is also working on incorporating Welsh language skills development into early years care training, ensuring that trainees have at least some basic Welsh language skills from their education. This approach aims to provide a strong foundation in Welsh language skills for those who will be teaching and interacting with children in Welsh or bilingual settings.&#10;3. Mudiad Meithrin regularly emphasizes the challenges of recruiting and retaining staff with strong Welsh language skills. To address this issue, upskilling the existing workforce is essential, along with attracting people with Welsh language skills during recruitment. This effort is being considered in the context of Cymraeg 2050's targets and the aim to reach one million Welsh speakers.&#10;4. Suzy Davies AM highlights the importance of developing Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce so that staff can confidently transmit the language to children, which involves training in child development, bilingual education methods, and language choices. This is especially important when interacting with children from non-Welsh speaking homes.&#10;5. Additionally, efforts are being made to ensure that there is an increase in the number of childcare places in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings to provide more opportunities for children to interact with education and childcare through Welsh at an earlier stage." />

    <node id=" just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. So, it's looking at both. I mean, actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder—?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, in 'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support" />
    <node id="Anne Daniels&#10;Content: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And how long have they been going for?&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in—I think it was—February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Julie.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare.

The exact cost of transforming the current temporary eligibility checking process with local authorities into a permanent one is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied to be less than the previously proposed HMRC system. There are no specific additional costs associated with creating a more flexible system.&#10;2. The Welsh Government plans to share more details about the cost estimations when available. No specific measures have been discussed to ensure that the proposed grant will be used exclusively for transforming the system into a permanent arrangement or addressing regional variations in take-up rates.&#10;3. While extending the childcare offer to parents who are in education and training could potentially help address variation in take-up rates, there has been no explicit mention of additional funding specifically earmarked for local authorities with higher demand or lower take-up rates. A pilot project is underway in Flint to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare provision, which could inform future policy decisions regarding funding and addressing regional variations." />
    <node id="1. Data Collection: To evaluate the impact of interventions on children's outcomes, it is essential to collect data on various factors such as attendance, engagement, and progress in both childcare and parenting courses. This information can help measure the effectiveness of these programs individually.&#10;2. Baseline Assessment: Conducting a baseline assessment of children's skills and development before they begin participating in childcare or parenting courses is crucial for measuring improvement over time. Comparing this data to their progress after attending these initiatives will provide insights into the specific contributions made by each program.&#10;3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Distributing surveys and questionnaires to parents about their experiences with and perceptions of childcare and parenting courses can help gauge the impact of these interventions. These tools can also inquire about other initiatives that parents might be involved in, allowing for a better understanding of the overall context in which these programs are being implemented.&#10;4. Longitudinal Studies: Following children's progress over an extended period can provide valuable insights into how different interventions contribute to their development at various stages. Longitudinal studies can help disentangle the individual effects of childcare and parenting courses when parents are participating in multiple initiatives simultaneously.&#10;5. Experimental Design: Implementing experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials, can help isolate the impact of specific interventions by comparing outcomes for children who participate in a program with those who do not. This methodology can be applied to both childcare and parenting courses to better understand their individual contributions.&#10;6. Collaboration between Providers: Encouraging collaboration and communication between childcare providers, parenting course facilitators, and other relevant stakeholders can help ensure a more cohesive approach to evaluating the impact of interventions on children's outcomes. By sharing best practices, resources, and data, these parties can work together to distinguish the individual contributions of childcare and parenting courses.&#10;7. Utilizing Existing Research: Building upon existing research about the effectiveness of different types of childcare and parenting interventions can provide a foundation for evaluating new initiatives. This information can help identify which factors are most important in contributing to positive outcomes for children, allowing for more targeted evaluation efforts." />
    <node id="1. Yes, there were issues with ensuring a bilingual service in HMRC's scheme. The reason for this is that there were technical difficulties related to Welsh language standards that made using HMRC more challenging than anticipated. Specifically, HMRC's IT systems had trouble processing special characters in the Welsh alphabet, such as 'ŧo bach'.&#10;2. However, these issues should have been worked out at the beginning of the process. The committee feels that the necessary due diligence was not done to ensure that HMRC could comply with the Welsh language standards. This is because the standards were present from the very beginning and nothing had changed in terms of those standards.&#10;3. It's important to note that while HMRC does provide a bilingual service, there are specific requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers that they must deliver against. These requirements caused some concerns for HMRC, particularly when considering the multiple IT systems involved in building up the childcare services." />

Sorry, Dawn.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. Early years is one of the eight priority areas for Government. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Have you got some information on that?&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase." />

Okay.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time.

    <node id="1. Encourage Take-up through Local Campaigns: To increase participation in Flying Start's informal parenting courses, local campaigns can be organized to raise awareness about their benefits and importance. Partnerships with community organizations and targeted outreach efforts towards families with young children can help boost attendance.&#10;&#10;2. Collect Data on Reasons for Non-participation: Currently, there is a lack of information on why parents are not taking up the offer of informal parenting courses. Gathering this data would help tailor strategies to address specific barriers to participation, such as lack of awareness, accessibility issues, or concerns about the content and format of the courses.&#10;&#10;3. Offer Flexible Formats: Providing a variety of course formats, including online, self-paced, and in-person sessions, can help cater to different learning styles and preferences. This may encourage parents who find traditional classroom settings unappealing or inconvenient to participate.&#10;&#10;4. Increase Awareness about the Role of Health Visitors: Emphasizing the role of health visitors in providing enhanced parenting support can encourage more parents to participate in available parenting courses or seek guidance from professionals. This approach may be particularly effective for parents who are hesitant to attend formal courses.&#10;&#10;5. Consider Extending Flying Start Benefits: Expanding the reach of Flying Start services to a larger population could potentially increase participation in informal parenting courses and other support services. The Welsh Government is currently looking into making Flying Start more accessible to more children beyond the current pathfinder areas.&#10;&#10;6. Promote Informal Parenting Support: Recognizing that not all parents may prefer or require formal parenting courses, encouraging health visitors, childcare workers, and other relevant professionals to provide advice, guidance, and top tips in a friendly and approachable manner can be an effective way to reach some parents who might otherwise be reluctant to participate in formal courses.&#10;&#10;Regarding the reasons preventing some parents from taking up the offer, potential barriers may include lack of awareness about the benefits of parenting courses or concerns about their content and format. Time constraints, accessibility issues, and cultural or linguistic challenges may also contribute to low participation rates. Collecting data on non-participation can help identify specific barriers that can be addressed through targeted strategies." />

Guidance issued for delivering the foundation phase: The Welsh Government has released guidance to support the wider delivery of the foundation phase in more non-maintained settings, which helps maintain standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase in these environments.&#10;&#10;2.

This approach aims to bring early education and childcare providers together, addressing one of the recommendations from the first-year report on the childcare offer.&#10;&#10;3. Merging policy teams: While there has been no explicit structural change in merging disparate parts of policy and delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer, the Welsh Government is working towards bringing those teams closer together to better align early years policies.&#10;&#10;These steps demonstrate that the Welsh Government is taking action to address the recommendations made in the first-year report on the childcare offer, with a focus on supporting non-maintained settings and encouraging co-location efforts between education and childcare providers." />

The committee believes that HMRC should have conducted thorough due diligence at the beginning of the process to ensure their IT systems could comply with the Welsh language standards, especially since those standards were present from the start and did not change.&#10;2.

This issue should have been addressed early on when understanding the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all involved IT systems, including feed-in systems from the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, and the Post Office.&#10;3.

    <node id="1. Cost: The costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had been originally outlined, making it more cost-effective to work with local authorities instead.&#10;2. Flexibility: Local authorities can provide greater flexibility in delivering certain aspects of the offer, such as training and education or dealing with specific groups like foster parents and people of a certain immigration status, which cannot be handled by HMRC.&#10;3. Value for Money: An investment made in developing a national system run by local authorities would support local authority employees based in Wales, rather than HMRC employees who may be based outside of Wales. This ensures that the investment stays within Wales.&#10;4. Technical Difficulties with Welsh Language Standards: Although HMRC can provide bilingual services, there were technical issues related to Welsh language standards that made using HMRC more difficult than anticipated, particularly in relation to special characters in the Welsh alphabet." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government, represented by Julie Morgan AM, values both universal and targeted approaches to allocate resources. She emphasizes the importance of a universal system where all children can access support, as seen in programs like Flying Start. However, she acknowledges the need to focus on disadvantaged children, who tend to do better in mixed socioeconomic environments than in strictly targeted ones.&#10;&#10;2. Suzy Davies AM raises concerns about capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas and suggests changing the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children specifically. While Julie Morgan AM clarifies that her considerations are for all children, she admits that the ideal scenario would be to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but budget constraints limit this possibility.&#10;&#10;3. Janet Finch-Saunders AM brings up the demand-driven approach and its focus on a more universal geographic spread. This approach aims to create opportunities for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds within their own age group. The discussion of this approach highlights the potential benefits of socioeconomic diversity in early years provision, fostering social mixing and cohesion among children.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are two main viewpoints regarding resource allocation: a universal, geographic spread approach and a more targeted demand-led approach. The former is exemplified by Flying Start, which aims to create mixed socioeconomic environments for children to interact and learn from one another. In contrast, the latter involves changing the outreach system to target disadvantaged children specifically while potentially avoiding capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas. Both approaches have their merits, and finding the right balance will depend on various factors, including budget constraints and specific policy goals." />

In response to the question about addressing variation and meeting increased demand for funding, the Welsh Government is planning to extend the childcare offer to parents who are in education and training. This expansion aims to widen the scope of the program and cater to more potential beneficiaries.

Maintaining Standards: Speakers Julie Morgan AM, Jo-Anne Daniels, and Lynne Neagle AM expressed concern about maintaining standards in early childhood education and care provision in Wales. They highlighted the importance of upholding the philosophy of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings through joint inspections by CIW and Estyn. They want to ensure that there is no drop in standards, especially since the foundation phase was groundbreaking when introduced and has proven successful.&#10;2. Impact of Budget Cuts: Sian Gwenllian AM and Julie Morgan AM mentioned the potential impact of budget cuts on early childhood education and care provision, specifically in relation to teaching assistants. They cautioned that lower standards might be implemented if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system, which could negatively affect the quality of education.&#10;3. Accessibility: Janet Finch-Saunders AM raised concerns about significant differences in early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales. She questioned whether the current demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents, is the right strategy. She suggested that more universal availability might be a better approach to increasing accessibility in various regions of Wales.">

In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting—again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help.

Data Collection: To evaluate the impact of interventions on children's outcomes, it is essential to collect data on various factors such as attendance, engagement, and progress in both childcare and parenting courses. This information can help measure the effectiveness of these programs individually.&#10;2. Baseline Assessment: Conducting a baseline assessment of children's skills and development before they begin participating in childcare or parenting courses is crucial for measuring improvement over time. Comparing this data to their progress after attending these initiatives will provide insights into the specific contributions made by each program.&#10;3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Distributing surveys and questionnaires to parents about their experiences with and perceptions of childcare and parenting courses can help gauge the impact of these interventions.

Longitudinal studies can help disentangle the individual effects of childcare and parenting courses when parents are participating in multiple initiatives simultaneously.&#10;5. Experimental Design: Implementing experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials, can help isolate the impact of specific interventions by comparing outcomes for children who participate in a program with those who do not. This methodology can be applied to both childcare and parenting courses to better understand their individual contributions.&#10;6. Collaboration between Providers: Encouraging collaboration and communication between childcare providers, parenting course facilitators, and other relevant stakeholders can help ensure a more cohesive approach to evaluating the impact of interventions on children's outcomes. By sharing best practices, resources, and data, these parties can work together to distinguish the individual contributions of childcare and parenting courses.&#10;7.

The Welsh Government, represented by Julie Morgan AM, values both universal and targeted approaches to allocate resources. She emphasizes the importance of a universal system where all children can access support, as seen in programs like Flying Start. However, she acknowledges the need to focus on disadvantaged children, who tend to do better in mixed socioeconomic environments than in strictly targeted ones.&#10;&#10;2.

While Julie Morgan AM clarifies that her considerations are for all children, she admits that the ideal scenario would be to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but budget constraints limit this possibility.&#10;&#10;3. Janet Finch-Saunders AM brings up the demand-driven approach and its focus on a more universal geographic spread. This approach aims to create opportunities for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds within their own age group. The discussion of this approach highlights the potential benefits of socioeconomic diversity in early years provision, fostering social mixing and cohesion among children.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are two main viewpoints regarding resource allocation: a universal, geographic spread approach and a more targeted demand-led approach. The former is exemplified by Flying Start, which aims to create mixed socioeconomic environments for children to interact and learn from one another. In contrast, the latter involves changing the outreach system to target disadvantaged children specifically while potentially avoiding capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas. Both approaches have their merits, and finding the right balance will depend on various factors, including budget constraints and specific policy goals.">

We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. So, again, that determines the pattern throughout Wales. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales.

The Welsh Government, represented by Julie Morgan AM, values both universal and targeted approaches to allocate resources. She emphasizes the importance of a universal system where all children can access support, as seen in programs like Flying Start. However, she acknowledges the need to focus on disadvantaged children, who tend to do better in mixed socioeconomic environments than in strictly targeted ones.&#10;&#10;2. Suzy Davies AM raises concerns about capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas and suggests changing the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children specifically. While Julie Morgan AM clarifies that her considerations are for all children, she admits that the ideal scenario would be to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but budget constraints limit this possibility.&#10;&#10;3. Janet Finch-Saunders AM brings up the demand-driven approach and its focus on a more universal geographic spread. This approach aims to create opportunities for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds within their own age group. The discussion of this approach highlights the potential benefits of socioeconomic diversity in early years provision, fostering social mixing and cohesion among children.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are two main viewpoints regarding resource allocation: a universal, geographic spread approach and a more targeted demand-led approach. The former is exemplified by Flying Start, which aims to create mixed socioeconomic environments for children to interact and learn from one another. In contrast, the latter involves changing the outreach system to target disadvantaged children specifically while potentially avoiding capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas. Both approaches have their merits, and finding the right balance will depend on various factors, including budget constraints and specific policy goals.">

The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that.

Data Collection: To evaluate the impact of interventions on children's outcomes, it is essential to collect data on various factors such as attendance, engagement, and progress in both childcare and parenting courses. This information can help measure the effectiveness of these programs individually.&#10;2. Baseline Assessment: Conducting a baseline assessment of children's skills and development before they begin participating in childcare or parenting courses is crucial for measuring improvement over time. Comparing this data to their progress after attending these initiatives will provide insights into the specific contributions made by each program.&#10;3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Distributing surveys and questionnaires to parents about their experiences with and perceptions of childcare and parenting courses can help gauge the impact of these interventions. These tools can also inquire about other initiatives that parents might be involved in, allowing for a better understanding of the overall context in which these programs are being implemented.&#10;4. Longitudinal Studies: Following children's progress over an extended period can provide valuable insights into how different interventions contribute to their development at various stages. Longitudinal studies can help disentangle the individual effects of childcare and parenting courses when parents are participating in multiple initiatives simultaneously.&#10;5. Experimental Design: Implementing experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials, can help isolate the impact of specific interventions by comparing outcomes for children who participate in a program with those who do not. This methodology can be applied to both childcare and parenting courses to better understand their individual contributions.&#10;6. Collaboration between Providers: Encouraging collaboration and communication between childcare providers, parenting course facilitators, and other relevant stakeholders can help ensure a more cohesive approach to evaluating the impact of interventions on children's outcomes. By sharing best practices, resources, and data, these parties can work together to distinguish the individual contributions of childcare and parenting courses.&#10;7.

Data Collection: To evaluate the impact of interventions on children's outcomes, it is essential to collect data on various factors such as attendance, engagement, and progress in both childcare and parenting courses. This information can help measure the effectiveness of these programs individually.&#10;2. Baseline Assessment: Conducting a baseline assessment of children's skills and development before they begin participating in childcare or parenting courses is crucial for measuring improvement over time. Comparing this data to their progress after attending these initiatives will provide insights into the specific contributions made by each program.&#10;3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Distributing surveys and questionnaires to parents about their experiences with and perceptions of childcare and parenting courses can help gauge the impact of these interventions. These tools can also inquire about other initiatives that parents might be involved in, allowing for a better understanding of the overall context in which these programs are being implemented.&#10;4. Longitudinal Studies: Following children's progress over an extended period can provide valuable insights into how different interventions contribute to their development at various stages. Longitudinal studies can help disentangle the individual effects of childcare and parenting courses when parents are participating in multiple initiatives simultaneously.&#10;5. Experimental Design: Implementing experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials, can help isolate the impact of specific interventions by comparing outcomes for children who participate in a program with those who do not. This methodology can be applied to both childcare and parenting courses to better understand their individual contributions.&#10;6. Collaboration between Providers: Encouraging collaboration and communication between childcare providers, parenting course facilitators, and other relevant stakeholders can help ensure a more cohesive approach to evaluating the impact of interventions on children's outcomes. By sharing best practices, resources, and data, these parties can work together to distinguish the individual contributions of childcare and parenting courses.&#10;7. Utilizing Existing Research: Building upon existing research about the effectiveness of different types of childcare and parenting interventions can provide a foundation for evaluating new initiatives. This information can help identify which factors are most important in contributing to positive outcomes for children, allowing for more targeted evaluation efforts.">

Encourage Take-up through Local Campaigns: To increase participation in Flying Start's informal parenting courses, local campaigns can be organized to raise awareness about their benefits and importance. Partnerships with community organizations and targeted outreach efforts towards families with young children can help boost attendance.&#10;&#10;2. Collect Data on Reasons for Non-participation: Currently, there is a lack of information on why parents are not taking up the offer of informal parenting courses. Gathering this data would help tailor strategies to address specific barriers to participation, such as lack of awareness, accessibility issues, or concerns about the content and format of the courses.&#10;&#10;3. Offer Flexible Formats: Providing a variety of course formats, including online, self-paced, and in-person sessions, can help cater to different learning styles and preferences. This may encourage parents who find traditional classroom settings unappealing or inconvenient to participate.&#10;&#10;4. Increase Awareness about the Role of Health Visitors: Emphasizing the role of health visitors in providing enhanced parenting support can encourage more parents to participate in available parenting courses or seek guidance from professionals. This approach may be particularly effective for parents who are hesitant to attend formal courses.&#10;&#10;5. Consider Extending Flying Start Benefits: Expanding the reach of Flying Start services to a larger population could potentially increase participation in informal parenting courses and other support services. The Welsh Government is currently looking into making Flying Start more accessible to more children beyond the current pathfinder areas.&#10;&#10;6. Promote Informal Parenting Support: Recognizing that not all parents may prefer or require formal parenting courses, encouraging health visitors, childcare workers, and other relevant professionals to provide advice, guidance, and top tips in a friendly and approachable manner can be an effective way to reach some parents who might otherwise be reluctant to participate in formal courses.&#10;&#10;Regarding the reasons preventing some parents from taking up the offer, potential barriers may include lack of awareness about the benefits of parenting courses or concerns about their content and format. Time constraints, accessibility issues, and cultural or linguistic challenges may also contribute to low participation rates.

The Welsh Government, represented by Julie Morgan AM, values both universal and targeted approaches to allocate resources. She emphasizes the importance of a universal system where all children can access support, as seen in programs like Flying Start. However, she acknowledges the need to focus on disadvantaged children, who tend to do better in mixed socioeconomic environments than in strictly targeted ones.&#10;&#10;2. Suzy Davies AM raises concerns about capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas and suggests changing the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children specifically. While Julie Morgan AM clarifies that her considerations are for all children, she admits that the ideal scenario would be to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but budget constraints limit this possibility.&#10;&#10;3. Janet Finch-Saunders AM brings up the demand-driven approach and its focus on a more universal geographic spread. This approach aims to create opportunities for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds within their own age group. The discussion of this approach highlights the potential benefits of socioeconomic diversity in early years provision, fostering social mixing and cohesion among children.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are two main viewpoints regarding resource allocation: a universal, geographic spread approach and a more targeted demand-led approach. The former is exemplified by Flying Start, which aims to create mixed socioeconomic environments for children to interact and learn from one another. In contrast, the latter involves changing the outreach system to target disadvantaged children specifically while potentially avoiding capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas. Both approaches have their merits, and finding the right balance will depend on various factors, including budget constraints and specific policy goals.">

Time constraints, accessibility issues, and cultural or linguistic challenges may also contribute to low participation rates.

The Welsh Government, represented by Julie Morgan AM, values both universal and targeted approaches to allocate resources. She emphasizes the importance of a universal system where all children can access support, as seen in programs like Flying Start. However, she acknowledges the need to focus on disadvantaged children, who tend to do better in mixed socioeconomic environments than in strictly targeted ones.&#10;&#10;2. Suzy Davies AM raises concerns about capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas and suggests changing the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children specifically. While Julie Morgan AM clarifies that her considerations are for all children, she admits that the ideal scenario would be to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but budget constraints limit this possibility.&#10;&#10;3. Janet Finch-Saunders AM brings up the demand-driven approach and its focus on a more universal geographic spread. This approach aims to create opportunities for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds within their own age group. The discussion of this approach highlights the potential benefits of socioeconomic diversity in early years provision, fostering social mixing and cohesion among children.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are two main viewpoints regarding resource allocation: a universal, geographic spread approach and a more targeted demand-led approach. The former is exemplified by Flying Start, which aims to create mixed socioeconomic environments for children to interact and learn from one another. In contrast, the latter involves changing the outreach system to target disadvantaged children specifically while potentially avoiding capturing those who don't fit the criteria in geographically targeted areas. Both approaches have their merits, and finding the right balance will depend on various factors, including budget constraints and specific policy goals.">

How many of them are in Flying Start areas?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas—I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that—? Do you know the actual percentage?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but—&#10;Speaker: Jo-Anne Daniels&#10;Content" target="The estimated percentage of children living in poverty within Flying Start areas is around 45%, as mentioned by Jo-Anne Daniels. However, the exact number cannot be determined due to the nature of benefit take-up data and the fact that eligibility for Flying Start services is not assessed within these areas. This makes it challenging to accurately identify the number of children in poverty who are using Flying Start services.">

Data Collection: To evaluate the impact of interventions on children's outcomes, it is essential to collect data on various factors such as attendance, engagement, and progress in both childcare and parenting courses. This information can help measure the effectiveness of these programs individually.&#10;2. Baseline Assessment: Conducting a baseline assessment of children's skills and development before they begin participating in childcare or parenting courses is crucial for measuring improvement over time. Comparing this data to their progress after attending these initiatives will provide insights into the specific contributions made by each program.&#10;3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Distributing surveys and questionnaires to parents about their experiences with and perceptions of childcare and parenting courses can help gauge the impact of these interventions. These tools can also inquire about other initiatives that parents might be involved in, allowing for a better understanding of the overall context in which these programs are being implemented.&#10;4. Longitudinal Studies: Following children's progress over an extended period can provide valuable insights into how different interventions contribute to their development at various stages. Longitudinal studies can help disentangle the individual effects of childcare and parenting courses when parents are participating in multiple initiatives simultaneously.&#10;5. Experimental Design: Implementing experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials, can help isolate the impact of specific interventions by comparing outcomes for children who participate in a program with those who do not. This methodology can be applied to both childcare and parenting courses to better understand their individual contributions.&#10;6. Collaboration between Providers: Encouraging collaboration and communication between childcare providers, parenting course facilitators, and other relevant stakeholders can help ensure a more cohesive approach to evaluating the impact of interventions on children's outcomes. By sharing best practices, resources, and data, these parties can work together to distinguish the individual contributions of childcare and parenting courses.&#10;7. Utilizing Existing Research: Building upon existing research about the effectiveness of different types of childcare and parenting interventions can provide a foundation for evaluating new initiatives.

Partnerships with community organizations and targeted outreach efforts towards families with young children can help boost attendance.&#10;&#10;2. Collect Data on Reasons for Non-participation: Currently, there is a lack of information on why parents are not taking up the offer of informal parenting courses. Gathering this data would help tailor strategies to address specific barriers to participation, such as lack of awareness, accessibility issues, or concerns about the content and format of the courses.&#10;&#10;3. Offer Flexible Formats: Providing a variety of course formats, including online, self-paced, and in-person sessions, can help cater to different learning styles and preferences. This may encourage parents who find traditional classroom settings unappealing or inconvenient to participate.&#10;&#10;4. Increase Awareness about the Role of Health Visitors: Emphasizing the role of health visitors in providing enhanced parenting support can encourage more parents to participate in available parenting courses or seek guidance from professionals.

Early years is one of the eight priority areas for Government. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Have you got some information on that?&#10;Speaker: Nicola Edwards&#10;Content: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase.">

Okay.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time.

What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that.

Cost: The costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had been originally outlined, making it more cost-effective to work with local authorities instead.&#10;2. Flexibility: Local authorities can provide greater flexibility in delivering certain aspects of the offer, such as training and education or dealing with specific groups like foster parents and people of a certain immigration status, which cannot be handled by HMRC.&#10;3. Value for Money: An investment made in developing a national system run by local authorities would support local authority employees based in Wales, rather than HMRC employees who may be based outside of Wales. This ensures that the investment stays within Wales.&#10;4. Technical Difficulties with Welsh Language Standards: Although HMRC can provide bilingual services, there were technical issues related to Welsh language standards that made using HMRC more difficult than anticipated, particularly in relation to special characters in the Welsh alphabet.">

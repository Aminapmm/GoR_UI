    <node id="1. Hidden buttons: One potential design idea is to have some of the buttons, such as audio settings and power switch, concealed underneath a folding ledge or similar mechanism. This would keep them hidden from everyday use but still accessible when needed.&#10;2. Changeable faceplate: Another idea is to create a changeable faceplate for the remote control, where the high-relevance and frequently used buttons like volume selection and channel selection are prominently displayed, while the low-relevance and infrequently used buttons are smaller or hidden on the reverse side.&#10;3. Voice recognition: The team also discussed incorporating voice recognition technology into the remote control, which would allow users to control the TV without needing to physically press any buttons. This would eliminate the need for a physical power switch and audio settings buttons altogether.&#10;4. Limited functions remote: Creating two versions of the remote control - one with only the main functions (channel control, volume control, and on/off) and another with additional features like audio settings and teletext. This would cater to both groups of users - those who prefer a more simplified and fashionable approach and those who want the whole functionality.&#10;5. Dual function remote: Another idea is to create a dual function remote that has both buttons and voice recognition technology, allowing users to choose how they want to control their TV. This would keep high-relevance and frequently used buttons easily accessible while also reducing the visibility of low-relevance and infrequently used buttons.&#10;6. Interchangeable covers: Adding interchangeable covers to the remote control would allow for customization, making it more appealing to users who value aesthetics over practicality. This could include different color schemes or designs that highlight the high-relevance and frequently used buttons while minimizing the low-relevance and infrequently used ones." />
    <node id=" users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like {disfmarker} well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the {disfmarker} uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very {disfmarker} aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate {gap} , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is {disfmarker} Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new {disfmarker} like first time users and stuff . And uh" />
    <node id="mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm , yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: then that would be easier . Um {vocalsound} and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face" />
    <node id=" the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used .

    <node id=" yeah , maybe such things are relevant .

    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is a mention that for the 45 to 55 age group, people use remote controls to a great extent. However, there is no specific data or research presented in the discussion about the proportion of users in different age groups who utilize remote controls.

    <node id="Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . Um {vocalsound} I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Sorry .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as {disf" />
    <node id=" Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: so that uh um uh {vocalsound} again the {disfmarker} n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh {disfmarker} such a source , um you know , compromise the {disfmarker} our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh whether whether different technology {disfmarker} um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for {disfmark" />
    <node id="Yes, based on the meeting transcript, the team is developing the user interface exclusively for televisions. The discussion includes references to a directive specifying that the project should cover television only and exclude teletext. While there is some ambiguity about whether this also excludes DVD players, videos, and satellite boxes, it seems clear that the primary focus is on creating a remote control design for televisions specifically. This conclusion is also supported by previous emails mentioned in the conversation, which emphasize television as the only device to be covered." />
    <node id="vocalsound} Yeah . We are doing just the television .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Oh I just have one question . So are we doing just the television or are we doing {disfmarker} so not D_V_D_ players ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: we okay , okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: no ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , like in the email of television only . In fact they're {gap} in the constraints email that I got .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" do this in and I uh {disfmarker} Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh {disfmarker} I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer {disfmarker} they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um {vocalsound} the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the volume settings have a high relevance of nine, meaning they are considered important by users. However, they are not frequently used, which suggests that users typically do not adjust the volume often. Despite this low usage frequency, when users do need to change the volume, it is crucial that they can easily find and use the volume settings. This highlights the importance of designing a user interface that keeps high-relevance but infrequently used functions, like volume settings, accessible and intuitive for users." />
    <node id=" that that would certainly be uh truly different . {vocalsound} Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , {vocalsound} would people miss them ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But look at the importance of them . The volume settings .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Relevance of two out of ten ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Vol volume ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: yes um&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: They're not used often&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: th {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but they are quite important when they're used .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: w we need to s identify things that {vocalsound} people actually need&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and and it's a function of" />
    <node id="1. A disposable remote control with a battery life of five to ten years could be a viable option for television remotes, especially considering the expected takeover of digital televisions within that time frame. This approach would align with the project manager's suggestion and address concerns about reducing moving parts.&#10;2. The disposable remote control's design should consider user preferences and research findings, such as the desire for a more aesthetically pleasing remote and the need to match users' operating behavior. High-relevance and frequently used buttons like volume selection and channel selection should be prominently displayed, while low-relevance and infrequently used buttons could be smaller or hidden on the reverse side.&#10;3. Incorporating voice recognition technology into the disposable remote control would further reduce moving parts and provide an alternative to physically pressing buttons, addressing accessibility concerns for users with disabilities or those who prefer a hands-free experience.&#10;4. The disposability aspect of the remote control should be carefully considered in terms of environmental impact. Options for recycling or refurbishing the remote could help mitigate some of these concerns. Additionally, making the remote control modular could allow for easier replacement of specific components, extending its lifespan and reducing waste.&#10;5. Given that 75% of people find their current remote controls ugly and 80% would spend more money on a better-looking remote, investing in a more stylish design could increase the product's perceived value and justify a higher price point. Customizable interchangeable covers or unique color schemes could further appeal to users who value aesthetics over practicality." />
    <node id=" uh a very valid one .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one {disfmarker} some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . By which time {disfmarker} I mean when all's said and done , the digital television {vocalsound} will be taking over in that time scale . Um&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having" />
    <node id="1. Energy Source: The energy source is the starting point of this system, providing power to the entire remote control. In the industrial designer's preference, they mention a rechargeable battery or battery dock as their preferred option due to its long-lasting nature and ability to be reused.&#10;&#10;2. Circuit Chip: The circuit chip is the brain of the remote control. It receives signals from the user interface (the buttons on the remote) and processes them, composing messages that are then sent to the television's DVD/DVR to tell it what to do.&#10;&#10;3. Switch: Although not explicitly mentioned in the schematic diagram, a switch is implied. The switch would control the flow of electricity from the energy source to the other components, activating them when buttons are pressed on the remote control.&#10;&#10;4. Light Bulb: The light bulb represents an indicator that confirms the remote control is receiving power and ready for use. It lights up once buttons start being pressed.&#10;&#10;5. Infrared Bulb (IR Blaster): The infrared bulb sends signals to the television, instructing it on which functions to perform based on inputs from the user interface. This component enables two-way communication between the remote control and the TV.&#10;&#10;Power Supply Preferences:&#10;- Rechargeable battery or battery dock as a reusable power source&#10;- Potential investigation into solar-powered options (mentioned in passing)&#10;- Avoidance of permanent batteries, as mentioned by the project manager due to potential issues when the battery dies." />
    <node id=" and um a sender and receiver . And um {disfmarker} oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um {vocalsound} a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between {disfmarker} so it'll light up once we start {disfmarker} once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And so my personal preferences {disfmarker} I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in ," />
    <node id=" it does this uh by {disfmarker} well , you need {disfmarker} to start off you need an energy source {vocalsound} and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is {disfmarker} that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um {disfmarker} Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , {vocalsound} uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . And um {disfmarker} oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram" />

A disposable remote control with a battery life of five to ten years could be a viable option for television remotes, especially considering the expected takeover of digital televisions within that time frame. This approach would align with the project manager's suggestion and address concerns about reducing moving parts.&#10;2. The disposable remote control's design should consider user preferences and research findings, such as the desire for a more aesthetically pleasing remote and the need to match users' operating behavior. High-relevance and frequently used buttons like volume selection and channel selection should be prominently displayed, while low-relevance and infrequently used buttons could be smaller or hidden on the reverse side.&#10;3. Incorporating voice recognition technology into the disposable remote control would further reduce moving parts and provide an alternative to physically pressing buttons, addressing accessibility concerns for users with disabilities or those who prefer a hands-free experience.&#10;4. The disposability aspect of the remote control should be carefully considered in terms of environmental impact. Options for recycling or refurbishing the remote could help mitigate some of these concerns. Additionally, making the remote control modular could allow for easier replacement of specific components, extending its lifespan and reducing waste.&#10;5. Given that 75% of people find their current remote controls ugly and 80% would spend more money on a better-looking remote, investing in a more stylish design could increase the product's perceived value and justify a higher price point. Customizable interchangeable covers or unique color schemes could further appeal to users who value aesthetics over practicality.">

Dual Function Remote: The project manager and marketing team can create a remote control that has both button functionality and voice recognition technology. This would cater to users who prefer traditional button usage as well as those who want a hands-free experience. High-relevance and frequently used buttons can be made more prominent, while low-relevance buttons could be hidden or made smaller.&#10;&#10;2. Interchangeable Covers: To appeal to users who value aesthetics, the team can introduce interchangeable covers with different color schemes or designs. This would allow users to customize their remote controls and match them to their preferences or home decor. High-relevance buttons can be featured prominently on these covers to maintain functionality.&#10;&#10;3. Limited Functions Remote: The team can consider creating two versions of the remote control – a basic version with only main functions (channel control, volume control, and power on/off) and an advanced version with additional features like audio settings and teletext. This approach would cater to users who prefer a simpler, more fashionable design as well as those who want more functionality.&#10;&#10;4. Changeable Faceplate: A changeable faceplate can be designed where high-relevance and frequently used buttons are prominently displayed, while low-relevance and infrequently used buttons are smaller or hidden on the reverse side. This would maintain functionality while also providing an aesthetically pleasing design.&#10;&#10;5. Hidden Buttons: Some buttons like audio settings and power switch can be concealed underneath a folding ledge or similar mechanism. This would keep them hidden from everyday use but still accessible when needed, creating a cleaner, more stylish appearance.&#10;&#10;6. Voice Recognition Technology: Incorporating voice recognition technology into the remote control would further reduce moving parts and provide an alternative to physically pressing buttons, addressing accessibility concerns for users with disabilities or those who prefer a hands-free experience. This feature could also contribute to the fashionable aspect of the remote by eliminating the need for certain physical buttons.&#10;&#10;7. Environmental Considerations: While pursuing aesthetic appeal, it is essential to consider environmental impact. Options for recycling or refurbishing the remote should be made available to mitigate waste. Making the remote control modular could also allow for easier replacement of specific components, extending its lifespan and reducing waste.">

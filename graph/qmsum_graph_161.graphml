    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Veterans Affairs) has stated that there is a plan to address the claims backlog and that it is a major priority. However, he does not explicitly confirm if this plan has been provided in written form. In addition, MP Alex Ruff has mentioned that the deputy minister committed to providing a written plan within a month to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs and make it public. Therefore, at the time of the transcript, it is unclear if the written plan has been made publicly available. To access the most up-to-date information regarding the existence and availability of this plan, it would be recommended to check the official website or contact the office of Veterans Affairs Canada." />
    <node id=", I appreciate my honourable colleague's question, and yes, we've indicated that it's a major priority. That's why I'm so pleased that the supplementary estimates contained just under $90 million to address hiring more staff, improving the process and making sure that we attack the backlog in an appropriate manner.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Alex Ruff&#10;Content: Madame Chair, does that plan exist in written form?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

Did the deputy minister or the department provide the minister that plan within a month?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

They were designed for military use for various military forces around the world. As I've said previously, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers. They're very efficient in their design for killing people. They have no purpose in Canadian society.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Alex Ruff&#10;Content: As someone who has used many military-style firearms and who is actually involved in helping define what we purchase in the military, I would use none of the ones that are currently prohibited.

In the beginning, eight years ago, the project was supposed to cost $2.6billion. There can't be much missing when the cost overrun is double the initial estimate. Why haven't the ships been delivered yet?

    <node id="1. The Liberal party blocked debate on expanding the wage subsidy program and refused to allow certain businesses that made acquisitions to access the program: Based on the transcripts, it is not explicitly stated why the Liberals blocked the debate on expanding the wage subsidy program or refused access to certain businesses that made acquisitions. However, it can be inferred that there may have been political disagreements between the Liberal and Conservative parties, as they both criticize each other for not wanting to debate the legislation.&#10;2. The rent relief program remains difficult to apply for and has only distributed a small fraction of its allocated funds to date: The transcripts mention that the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance (CECRA) program has only paid out less than 2% of its $3 billion budgeted as of June 8, despite being available for application since mid-May. Some businesses and landlords find it difficult to apply for this program, which has resulted in many not bothering to apply and leaving small businesses to fall through the cracks.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Liberal party blocked debate on expanding the wage subsidy program while criticizing the Conservatives for not wanting to debate the legislation. Meanwhile, the rent relief program has only distributed a small fraction of its allocated funds due to difficulty in applying for the program and lack of interest from landlords." />

Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Lib.)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, from the very beginning we knew that as we rolled out measures, we would need to improve them and tweak them, and that's exactly what we've been doing over the past three months. We needed to make measures happen quickly for Canadians, and we did that. But we continued to improve them, to make additions and amendments so that more people could get the help they needed, including with the proposed legislation last week that expanded the reach of the wage subsidy to more businesses. Unfortunately, the Conservatives didn't even want us to debate that particular piece of legislation.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Andrew Scheer&#10;Content: Actually, Mr. Chair, it was the Liberals who said no to the motion to allow this Parliament to sit to debate that motion, and even in that legislation they refused to allow businesses who have made acquisitions to access the program. Now, when we look at the rent relief program, it is so difficult to apply for it that many landlords are refusing to bother, leaving even more small businesses to fall through the cracks.

We're continuing to monitor the CECRA program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Bob Saroya&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, the government business rent relief program has been a total disaster.

The first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, for months Conservatives have been pointing out flaws in Liberal government programs that are preventing Canadians from getting the help they need. The Prime Minister has refused to make these very technical changes to get more help to Canadians who need it. For example, on the wage subsidy, more than two-thirds of the money allocated for that program has lapsed because businesses don't qualify. I have a simple question. Will the Prime Minister change the program to allow companies who have made acquisitions to access the wage subsidy to keep more people working?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon.

When will he make these changes to get more help to Canadians who need it?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, throughout this pandemic, we have constantly been updating and expanding our various programs. We recognize, in conversations with the premiers, how important it is to make sure that we're working together, the provinces and the federal government, on issues like rent subsidies where commercial rent is indeed a provincial jurisdiction. Many provinces have moved forward with the eviction bans that are necessary to go along with this, and we'll continue to work with provinces to make sure that we're getting Canadians the help they need.&#10;Speaker: Hon.

According to the latest news, Seaspan Shipyards will be spending an additional $1.5billion to build two ships. Why? Because the ships were ordered in 2011 and still haven't been delivered. Davie built the Asterix without going over budget because it delivered the ship on time. Davie is currently the top shipyard, representing 50% of Canada's shipbuilding capacity. Why isn't Davie being awarded its fair share of contracts?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement)&#10;Content: I'd like to thank the member for her question. Davie is certainly a strong and trusted partner that works very hard to help our government get results for Canadians. Building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for cost estimates to change throughout the procurement project.

    <node id="The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is being accused of acting like a monarch with a divine right because of his behavior regarding the extension of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic's mandate. Despite receiving a minority mandate from Quebecers and Canadians, he has acted as if he has the authority of a majority government, disregarding the opposition's proposal to extend the committee's mandate and help people with disabilities.&#10;&#10;The Bloc Québécois proposed to split the government's bill in two to assist people with disabilities and extend the discussions on this matter. However, Trudeau refused this assistance, stating that unanimous consent of the Chamber was required to debate it, and the Conservative Party voted against it. This has led to accusations that he is not respecting the voice of the majority in Parliament and acting as if he has a divine right to rule.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Trudeau's refusal to provide a fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic has added to the perception that he is trying to sideline Parliament, dominate the news cycle, and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy.

Certainly the game plan has become very transparent. He has a daily report show and he wants to sideline Parliament, dominate the news cycle and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is no reason that he cannot provide the fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PBO has published a number of reports himself. Why won't the Prime Minister provide a fiscal update so we can all understand the state of our economy, or is that just not part of his campaign playbook?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

Under more pressure than ever, their staff and volunteers continue to serve a community whose need was great even before the crisis. Their food bank helps over 4,000 people weekly. They have opened outdoor washrooms and hand-washing stations for vulnerable communities and are delivering groceries and other essentials to vulnerable seniors. ACSA is a bridge between those who can help and those who need help, and they are just one example of how our community has come together to meet this challenge. There are restaurants and businesses donating meals to front-line workers, residents answering the call to stock the food bank shelves and neighbours looking in on the vulnerable and isolated.

    <node id="The transcript suggests that the Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Mona Fortier, is facing pressure from the opposition parties to provide an economic update in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. The first petition deals with the issue of euthanasia and long-term care. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The second petition speaks to the ongoing conversations happening in Canada around systemic discrimination and systemic racism. I think we do need to reflect on systemic discrimination. This petition deals specifically with Bill 21 in Quebec and raises concerns. The reality of the way that bill applies is that people from certain backgrounds who wish to practise their faith are not able to fully participate in Canadian society if they are employed in the public service. This petition asks the government to provide a response on that issue, something it hasn't done in response to past petitions on this. The third petition deals with the issue of firearms.

The Liberal government has not taken any steps to reform the RCMP or implement the action plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, as pointed out by the NDP members during the meeting. This is in spite of acknowledging the presence of systemic racism within the criminal justice system, including the RCMP, and the need for equitable outcomes for Indigenous people, black Canadians, and other racialized people.&#10;2. The city of Montreal, on the other hand, has recognized systemic racism and announced measures to address it, as highlighted by the NDP member Mr. Alexandre Boulerice.

The Liberal government does claim to be committed to addressing systemic racism in this country and taking significant, bold actions to reduce discrimination against indigenous peoples and racialized Canadians.

Eight weeks ago, Minister Freeland said, I have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today. Meanwhile, we've had support going to the arts and we've had support going to fisheries, just to name a few, but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges, it has been radio silence. That was eight weeks ago today. Can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

The petition notes that the vast majority of firearms-related crimes in Canada involves illegal guns. At the same time, the petitioners are concerned that the government has the wrong focusthat is, harassing law-abiding firearms ownerswithout putting in place substantial measures to deal with illegal guns. The petitioners want to see the reversal of the order in council from May 1 and strong measures to deal with illegal firearms.

    <node id="1. The current challenge faced by creators in the music industry is the significant decline in their income, despite the increased accessibility of culture and music through digital technology. This paradox can be attributed to the way the digital technology revolution has disrupted the system for distributing wealth generated by creators, with various internet stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires, benefiting instead. The petition mentioned addresses this issue by proposing a minimum royalty model for streaming platforms and requesting that telecom providers share their profits with artists since they sell their services as direct access to culture.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the Canadian government has provided support measures tailored to the arts and culture sector's needs during the COVID-19 crisis. These include adapting the CERB to consider royalties and extending it for a more extended period, acknowledging that recovery in this sector may take longer (Hon. Steven Guilbeault). The government is also consulting with arts and culture stakeholders to develop long-term solutions, though details of these efforts have not been disclosed yet (Hon. Steven Guilbeault).&#10;&#10;The challenges faced by creators in the music industry highlight a pressing need for fair compensation models that adequately reflect the value of their work in the digital era and address the issues arising from digital technology's impact on wealth distribution within the cultural ecosystem." />
    <node id="ically, creators' incomes have never been so low. The advent of digital technology has completely overturned the system for distributing the wealth generated by creators for the benefit of various Web stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires. This petition addresses these problems and proposes realistic solutions. The first is to set a minimum royalty model for streaming platforms for artists. The second is to update the existing private copying system. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. The fourth is that the GAFAMs have to pay taxes on their services. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours. As an artist, I am proud to present this petition today because the issues it raises are fundamental to the survival of Quebec culture.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We'll now continue with Mr. Genuis.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC)&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

The Liberal government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has not yet committed to a review of the RCMP budget with the specific intention of reallocating resources to community services and addressing systemic racism, as requested by Black Lives Matter and other advocates.&#10;2. Despite acknowledging the presence of systemic racism within the criminal justice system, including the RCMP, and recognizing the need for equitable outcomes for Indigenous people, black Canadians, and other racialized people, the Liberal government has not taken any concrete steps to implement reforms or an action plan related to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.&#10;3. The city of Montreal has recognized systemic racism and announced measures to address it, contrasting with the Liberal government's approach towards reforming the RCMP and dealing with systemic racism.&#10;4. While the Liberal government claims a commitment to addressing systemic racism in Canada, their lack of action on implementing reforms or the action plan for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, along with not allocating resources towards community services instead of policing, contradicts these statements." />

There are still places where telework is not possible today because of the lack of adequate coverage. However, since2015, the government has committed to addressing the situation through three new programs.

Three parties agreed, which was the right thing to do in the context of this minority government. We've been working with the other parties.

Krystal's employer has asked her to return to work or take a leave, but she is uncomfortable returning to work due to safety concerns.

The current challenge faced by creators in the music industry is the significant decline in their income, despite the increased accessibility of culture and music through digital technology. This paradox can be attributed to the way the digital technology revolution has disrupted the system for distributing wealth generated by creators, with various internet stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires, benefiting instead. The petition mentioned addresses this issue by proposing a minimum royalty model for streaming platforms and requesting that telecom providers share their profits with artists since they sell their services as direct access to culture.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the Canadian government has provided support measures tailored to the arts and culture sector's needs during the COVID-19 crisis. These include adapting the CERB to consider royalties and extending it for a more extended period, acknowledging that recovery in this sector may take longer (Hon. Steven Guilbeault). The government is also consulting with arts and culture stakeholders to develop long-term solutions, though details of these efforts have not been disclosed yet (Hon. Steven Guilbeault).&#10;&#10;The challenges faced by creators in the music industry highlight a pressing need for fair compensation models that adequately reflect the value of their work in the digital era and address the issues arising from digital technology's impact on wealth distribution within the cultural ecosystem.">

The first petition deals with the issue of euthanasia and long-term care. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The second petition speaks to the ongoing conversations happening in Canada around systemic discrimination and systemic racism. I think we do need to reflect on systemic discrimination.

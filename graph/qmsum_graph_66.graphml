    <node id=" be audio controls ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;" />
    <node id=": Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . We put it out .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume {disfmarker} hi&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . You you put that into audio .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And then video is anything that you can see .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , and then visual {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />
    <node id=" need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um {vocalsound} Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic {disfmarker} a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the" />
    <node id=" , and then visual {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um . Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and then just actual device things ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Colour , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: like what channel you're watching , turning on an off ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure . Sure .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: stuff like that .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Like random" />
    <node id=" the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um things like on off .

Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Not on off video . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right" />

Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Any of {disfmarker} you anything to add to that at all ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I'll add it later , I guess {gap} the presentation .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .

    <node id="1. Customers dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, finding them ugly and wanting something more fashionable and sleek. This is a major issue as many customers are willing to pay more for a remote control that looks fancy.&#10;2. There is a demand for voice recognition technology in remote controls, with most adults expressing a willingness to pay more for this feature.&#10;3. The company wants to create a product that is not only high-tech but also aesthetically pleasing, focusing on both the ergonomics and the appearance of the remote control. This fits in with their vision of fashion in electronics.&#10;4. (Additional) Some customers may prefer advanced functionality in remote controls, such as audio and video controls, but it may not map well to a traditional design. Consideration should be given to how these features can be incorporated into the design while keeping the product fashionable and user-friendly." />
    <node id=" 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . Uh to think about trends and also about {disfmarker} try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Bouncing on top . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Dunno . Okay . Um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um {vocalsound} the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later ," />
    <node id=" thing .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh Yep . Yep . So each component represents one function ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and the power are things that you won't have to care about .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies" />
    <node id=" , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um . {vocalsound} And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be {disfmarker} wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um people {vocalsound} uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So want" />
    <node id=" Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure . Sure .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , w I'm done .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Are you are you all done ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: More or less . Yeah . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: you know , stuff like that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay ." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the project appears to have a certain level of complexity. The Industrial Designer is discussing basic principles and components, as well as different functions that the device can perform. There seems to be some discussion around the user interface, including speech recognition technology, which suggests that the device's operation may not be straightforward.&#10;&#10;The conversation also indicates potential redundancy in the project. The Marketing speaker mentions &quot;a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh... the things.&quot; This could mean that there are several features or components being considered that may overlap or serve similar purposes, leading to possible redundancies that the team will need to address.&#10;&#10;The team also discusses the idea of having a wireless setup, which, if implemented, could help reduce some of this potential redundancy and complexity by eliminating the need for physical connections between components. However, going wireless may introduce its own set of challenges related to signal reliability, power consumption, and security." />

    <node id="Content: if we can .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Why is that ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Could it be an on off thing ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Like if you want it on {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Where you can activate it and deactivate it ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features" />
    <node id="activate it ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Sure .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So maybe we should {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I suggest that we think about speech recognition ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Sure . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: anyway it's a {disfmarker} it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh-huh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah ." />
    <node id=": Marketing&#10;Content: Here , I'll just {vocalsound} Why don't I just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Just just switch them .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda {disfmarker} This is so {disfmarker} This {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} {gap} bit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I'm all in a knot now .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh {vocalsound} the things .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh , like overlap" />
    <node id="1. Designated Charging Unit: The team is considering whether to include a charging unit for the remote control instead of using regular batteries. This would add complexity and cost to the design, as well as requiring an additional physical component like a docking cradle. They also mentioned the need for the user to plug it in if not using a docking cradle, indicating they are considering wireless charging solutions.&#10;2. Ease of Use: The marketing speaker suggests having three or more groupings of controls based on their frequency of use. Habitual controls should be within the user's natural grip, while less frequently used controls can be concealed. This would make the remote control more user-friendly by making it clear what users need to do and where they need to go for different functions.&#10;3. Construction: The industrial designer mentions that adding a charging unit would increase the complexity of the design. Adding new features, particularly ones that require significant changes like a charging unit or wireless connectivity, can impact the construction of the remote control, potentially leading to higher production costs and more complicated assembly processes.&#10;4. Decision-Making Process: During their discussion, the team is trying to prioritize customer needs and ease of use. They are considering various factors such as user experience, accessibility, frequency of use, and potential redundancy in features. By examining this information and focusing on customer needs, they aim to make informed decisions about the design and functionality of the remote control." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {gap} Increase that 'cause we can't see the {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's much better .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right . Can you um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: There you go .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right , okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . Alright . That would be {disfmarker} Okay . So um does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could {disfmarker} and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer" />
    <node id=" that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oka&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and then others that are concealed .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;" />
    <node id=" so that's what we should do for now I think . Something I was wondering about was the power .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: There's a there's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh-huh . Uh-huh .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Or you need to get the user to plug" />
    <node id="1. Transmitter and receiver: These are mentioned as basic functions for communication between the device and another unit, such as a TV.&#10;2. Logic chip: This component is responsible for processing and executing instructions given to the device.&#10;3. Input device: This refers to the mechanism by which users will interact with the device, such as buttons or touchscreens.&#10;4. Power-related components: The Industrial Designer mentions that power-related aspects of the design are not a primary concern at this stage, suggesting that they will be addressed later in the project.&#10;5. Transmission technology: There is some discussion about using traditional transmission technologies versus newer methods for communication between the device and another unit. This may involve considering factors such as signal reliability, range, and power consumption." />

Um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well this is just the working design um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well this is just what {disfmarker} how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're {disfmarker} we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like {disfmarker} Besides the basics , I think back {disfmarker} in the back of our minds we know" />

Yeah ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: would you {disfmarker} how much would you pay ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . These are the age groups which we have information on&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and these are {disfmarker} this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Okay&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mostly focused around the twenty five age group .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Marketing" />
    <node id=" to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .

    <node id="The crew of the I.S.P. ship is taking several steps to try and escape from the gravity trap of the planetoid they are stuck on. Firstly, Captain Brooke has decided that they will need to use the magnetic repulsion plates to blast off the surface of the planetoid, given the high gravity. However, their attempts to contact Randall in the rocket room have failed, as his screen remains blank and he does not respond. The crew is trying to locate him and get him to cut the jets in the rocket room.&#10;&#10;Randall, on the other hand, is not at his battle station and has been missing since the crash landing. He initially had an excuse for not being at his station, but Captain Brooke is clearly upset with him for neglecting his duties. When last seen, Randall was appearing in the doorway of the ship, adjusting a bandaged forehead from the crash landing. It is unclear where he went after that or what he plans to do." />
    <node id=" type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to Randall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes himself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action, too late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent a crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding them in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided a man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser, the strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them, was anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against the sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in the cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could reach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.&#10; &#10; &quot;Pretty much of a mess!&quot; Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he turned to Scotty Byrnes. &quot;What's your opinion? Think we can patch her up, or are we stuck here indefinitely" />
    <node id=" Tom tugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed mournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long, ragged line of cliffs.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think we got Koerber, though,&quot; he said at last. &quot;While Tom was doing a job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast and out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To hell with Koerber!&quot; Tom Jeffery exploded. &quot;You mean we're stuck in this hellish rock-pile?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Easy, Tom!&quot; Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale, impassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. &quot;Where's Randall?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Probably hiding his head under a bunk!&quot; Dallas laughed with scorn. His contemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who failed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place in the I.S.P.&#10; &#10; &quot;Considering the gravity of this planetoid,&quot; Dennis Brooke said thoughtfully, &quot;it's going to take some blast to get us off!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe we can" />
    <node id="ry, man!&quot; He banked again and then zoomed out of the increasing gravity trap.&#10; &#10; &quot;Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the jets!&quot; But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then Koerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught, forced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of a whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that shook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.&#10; &#10; Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to meet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy. It showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active. Gravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this unknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time was supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could possibly explain the incredible gravity.&#10; &#10; And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to Randall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes himself cut the jets. The Magnetic" />
    <node id=" up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was ripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under the detonating impact.&#10; &#10; It was then that Dennis Brooke saw the immense dark shadow looming immediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom desperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass, but too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no avail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was doomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful magnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; With a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennis maneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he sank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the maneuver avoided it.&#10; &#10; &quot;George Randall!&quot; He shouted desperately into the speaker. &quot;Cut all jets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!&quot; He banked again and then zoomed out of the increasing gravity trap.&#10; &#10; &quot;Randall! I've got to use the" />
    <node id="Perhaps you wanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding job....&quot; That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the words had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His candid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage with its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened the anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized this was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better men than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there had been an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in the grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung his neck!&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly, Randall,&quot; he replied in a much more kindly tone. &quot;We'll need all hands now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thank you, sir!&quot; Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his mouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon him, he whirled and re-entered the ship.&#10; &#10; &quot;But for him we wouldn't be here" />
    <node id=" gravity of this planetoid,&quot; Dennis Brooke said thoughtfully, &quot;it's going to take some blast to get us off!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for our atom-busters to chew on!&quot; Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal optimist.&#10; &#10; &quot;Better break out those repair plates,&quot; Dennis said to Scotty. &quot;Tom, you get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log book, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try to find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,&quot; he said in a low voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.&#10; &#10; A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear the last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead bumped during the crash landing.&#10; &#10; &quot;Captain ... I ... I wanted ...&quot; he paused unable to continue.&#10; &#10; &quot;You wanted what?&quot; Captain Brooke's voice was terse. &quot;Perhaps you wanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty" />
    <node id="The I.S.P. Cruiser is in a damaged condition after being drawn to a strange planet by Koerber's magnetic beam. The atom-blast from the pirate ship penetrated the hull into the forward fuel chambers, and the crash-landing further worsened the damage. Scotty Byrnes, the ship's mechanic, notes that while there are some beryloid plates in the storage locker, the main rocket feed has been severed due to Koerber's parting shot. Therefore, they had to use the emergency tank to make it down to the planetoid's surface.&#10;&#10;When asked by Captain Brooke if they can repair the ship or if they are stranded there indefinitely, Scotty hesitates and says that they may as well know that their main rocket feed has been cut.

The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into the forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower petals. The crash-landing had not helped either.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain, but,&quot; he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.&#10; &#10; &quot;But what? Speak up man!&quot; It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his ordinarily gentle voice like a lash.&#10; &#10; &quot;But, you may as well know it,&quot; Scotty replied quietly. &quot;That parting shot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use the emergency tank to make it down here!&quot;&#10; &#10; For a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. Dennis Brooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tom tugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed mournfully at the damaged ship.

    <node id=" tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched them intimately.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser, a surprise awaited them. It was young George Randall, whose excited face met them as soon as they had entered the airlocks and removed the space suits.&#10; &#10; &quot;Captain Brooke ... Captain, recordings are showing on the new 'Jet Analyzers' must be the trail of some spacer. Can't be far!&quot; He was fairly dancing in his excitement, as if the marvelous work of the new invention that detected the disturbance of atomic jets at great distance were his own achievement.&#10; &#10; Dennis Brooke smiled. His own heart was hammering, and inwardly he prayed that it were Koerber. It had to be! No interplanetary passenger spacer could possibly be out here at the intersection of angles Kp&#10;39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. None but a pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could dare! This was the dangerous asteroid belt, where even planetoids drifted in eccentric uncharted orbits.&#10; &#10; Dennis, Tom Jeffery and Scotty Byrnes raced to the control room, followed by the ponderous Dallas to whom hurry in" />
    <node id="Dennis Brooke's hazel eyes narrow with alertness as he notices a young Martian's unwinking, violet stare filled with hatred and possibly envy or jealousy, because he senses danger.

    <node id=" and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality under the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.&#10; &#10; It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a fortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a sheaf of credits—it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and most of his heart in Marla.&#10; &#10; Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the insidious Verbena , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty glass of Martian Bacca-glas , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel eyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a young Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in those eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy? Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger brought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could instantly denote.&#10; &#10; His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

The latter had edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad semi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in a final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and tilted back invitingly.&#10; &#10; Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the handsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the tinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand, and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his feet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one side as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis Brooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl cried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was not there.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided the murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and planted" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending. When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of Marla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not fill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded. True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his fault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian Chamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been ready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers that almost surrounded the space pirate.&#10; &#10; A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every dream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use of hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as if by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's soul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality under the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.&#10; &#10; It cost a young fortune." />

Upon search, the police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under his left arm-pit—an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout the interplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates still without the law were known to possess them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck, Brooke!&quot; The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. &quot;If I'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew. Who else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and have in his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete records on that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps they have details on this dandy!&quot; He eyed admiringly the priceless Martian embroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border of red, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black acerine on his finger.&#10; &#10; Dennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put to shame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile" />
    <node id=" Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided the murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and planted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all Martians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the Martian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin that staggered and all but dropped him.&#10; &#10; The Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered back and sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But he was not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight for Dennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis took it, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride over with all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw and spun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowly sagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor.&#10; &#10; Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the international police arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life.

Commander behind the immense Aluminil desk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six foot four frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as if uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a decision, he were forcing himself to speak:&#10; &#10; &quot;Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for two reasons. The first one you already know—your capture of one of Koerber's henchmen—has given us a line as to his present orbit of piracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's not really why I've brought you here.&quot; He frowned again as if what he had to say were difficult indeed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her—a delicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, and very clever young lady could perform. And,&quot; he paused, grimacing,&#10;&quot;somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringing her and several" />
    <node id="The outcome of the daring chase and battle between Dennis Brooke's I.S.P. cruiser and Koerber's pirate craft is that both ships sustain significant damage, with Koerber's ship being drawn into a gravity trap of a looming mass and ultimately destroyed. The I.S.P. cruiser also suffers severe damage, with the atom-blast from the pirate ship penetrating the hull into the forward fuel chambers, and the crash-landing further worsening the damage. The main rocket feed of the I.S.P. cruiser has been severed due to Koerber's parting shot, leaving the crew stranded on a planetoid's surface with only an emergency tank to make it down. However, the discovery of a potential trail on the new 'Jet Analyzers' provides a glimmer of hope for their survival and pursuit of Koerber." />

But to Dennis Brooke, directing the chase from the control room, even certain death was welcome, if only he could take Koerber with him.&#10; &#10; Weaving through the deadly belt for several hours, Dennis saw his quarry slow down. Instantly he seized the chance and ordered a salvo from starboard. Koerber's powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up spewing Genton-shells. The battle was on at last.&#10; &#10; From the banked atom-cannon of the I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain of atomic fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged rent back toward midship showed on Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if it had been mortally wounded. Then Dennis maneuvered his cruiser into a power dive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the space lane above him, but as he came up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was ripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under the detonating impact." />
    <node id="The story mentions that an interplanetary spacer carrying Marla Starland, the fiancee of Dennis Brooke, and a cargo of radium from Venus has sent distress signals and disappeared on its way from Venus to Terra.

Finally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three days overdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untold millions, the spacer itself—seem to have vanished.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazel eyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slits that smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides, while something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruel precision.&#10; &#10; &quot;Marla!&quot; He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the power of Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like an atom-blast.&#10; &#10; &quot;Commander,&quot; Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths of emotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself—and that grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another known every change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human" />

They all knew the story in various versions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit in their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.&#10; &#10; Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow, easygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the swiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of men toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third lieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed by Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself.

He watched them bridge the space to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a proud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he turned away with a look of shame.&#10; &#10; Inside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed survey.&#10; &#10; &quot;No doubt about it,&quot; he spoke through the radio in his helmet. &quot;Cargo missing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were out of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been fired by Koerber!&quot; He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly he seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced. Somehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed, where life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great resolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him.&#10; &#10; Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in thinking of her and all he had lost.

There could be no doubt now! The &quot;Jet Analyzer&quot; recorded powerful disturbance, atomic—could be nothing else.&#10; &#10; Instantly Captain Brooke was at the inter-communication speaker:&#10; &#10; &quot;Crew, battle stations! Engine room, full speed!&quot;&#10; &#10; Scotty Byrnes was already dashing to the engine room, where his beloved motors purred with an ascending hum. Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser each member of the crew raced to his assigned task without delay. Action impended, and after days and nights of inertia, it was a blessed relief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces, and the banter of men suddenly galvanized by a powerful incentive was bandied back and forth. All but George Randall. Now that action was imminent. Something gripped his throat until he could hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S.P. uniform. A growing nausea gripped his bowels, and although he strove to keep calm, his hands trembled beyond control.&#10; &#10; In the compact, super-arm" />
    <node id="The target of the S.P.

Patrol's mission is to protect and ensure the safety of space travelers and combat threats such as piracy, which puts ships and lives at risk." />
    <node id="S.P. Patrol spacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was hoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a thing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the comfortable luxury that they knew.&#10; &#10; Day after day they went through their drills, donning space suits, manning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and eternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast.&#10; &#10; And suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search as a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the viso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to life. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured the space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the viso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and becoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport.&#10; &#10; Presently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke commanded through the teleradio from the control room:&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id=", Dennis,&quot; the Commander emphasized his words, &quot;is your chance to redeem yourself!&quot; He fell silent, while the viso-screen began to show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacer up-tilted in its cradle.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; They watched the parabola it made in its trajectory as it flashed into space and then fell into orbit there beyond the planetary attraction of Venus. On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real.&#10; &#10; A flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on the viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud interplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void, and suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved as if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining altitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic course, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's side.&#10; &#10; Tiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in actuality.

It seemed to him as if an eternity passed before at last, a black speck danced on the illuminated screen, until it finally reached the center of the viso-screen and remained there. It grew by leaps and bounds as the terrific speed of the cruiser minimized the distance long before the quarry was aware of pursuit.&#10; &#10; But at last, when the enemy cruiser showed on the viso-screen, unmistakably for what it was—a pirate craft, it showed by its sudden maneuver that it had detected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had described a parabola in space and headed for the dangerous asteroid belt. As if navigated by a masterly hand that knew each and every orbit of the asteroids, it plunged directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to lose the I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneuver. Ordinarily, it would have succeeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such" />
    <node id=", the fatal spots must have been huge in actuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it was an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with deadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of the barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank.&#10; &#10; Commander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose features were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor and the burning fire in his eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach Terra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other transports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes they're never seen again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;When do I leave, Commander!&quot; Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin of ice.&#10; &#10; &quot;Right now, if you wish.

He felt nauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of space. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale when the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who were to go beside himself:&#10; &#10; &quot;You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, Captain!&quot; Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in his basso-profundo voice.&#10; &#10; &quot;You and I'll take a second emergency!&quot; There was a pause in the voice of the Captain from the control room, then: &quot;Test space suits.

    <node id="1. The situation with Koerber's ship after it was caught by the lashing magnetic beam of the pirate ship is that it preceded the I.S.P. Cruiser in a free fall, and then the Planetoid rushed up to engulf them both. This suggests that they were drawn into the planetoid's gravity trap, which ultimately destroyed Koerber's ship.&#10;2. The possible explanation for the incredible gravity of the unknown planetoid is that it could be the legendary core of the world that was once supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. This is suggested by its diameter being 1200 miles, having a mineral and radio-active composition, and gravity seven-eighths of Terra.&#10;3.

The girl was beautiful, in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left him cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts in silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not to speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom upon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one solitude—the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.&#10; &#10; Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.

    <node id="The second reason that the I.S.P. Commander summoned Captain Dennis Brooke despite his grounding was because Marla Starland, Brooke's fiancee, had accepted a delicate assignment offer from the I.S.P. for a mission on Terra. This mission was particularly suited for an attractive and clever young woman like Marla. However, between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer carrying Marla and several other passengers began to send distress signals and ultimately disappeared. The ship, along with all the passengers and a cargo of radium from Venus worth millions, seemed to have vanished. This tragedy is the second reason why the I.S.P. Commander summoned Brooke, as he wanted him to take up this mission and find out what happened to Marla and the spacer." />
    <node id="Based on the story, Captain Brooke is leaving &quot;right now, if he wishes&quot; after being informed about the sixth transport loss. The I.S.P. Commander mentions that they have a new cruiser which is armored in beryloid with double hull and has superior speed, suitable for pursuing and combating the threats." />
    <node id="1. A speck appeared on the viso-screen, which gradually grew larger and turned into the drifting shell of what used to be a transport ship. This sighting caused the I.S.P. cruiser to come to life, abandoning their previous search, which they had considered a wild goose chase up until that point." />
    <node id="­In Dennis Brooke's last letter from his lover Marla, the bittersweet content lies in his expression of love for her despite declining her offer to be together on other planets. He mentions that he has accepted a new assignment and says his final goodbye, knowing that there will be no temptation for him as he wants solitude to coordinate his thoughts and salvage something from the wreck of his heart and career. The loss of Marla has left an aching void in him, but he is also mourning the loss of his Space career after being grounded. He reflects on their past love by reminiscing about Marla's tawny loveliness and the blue ecstasy of her eyes, indicating the bittersweet memories he holds of their time together." />

    <node id="The mysterious planetoid that the I.S.P. ship is being pulled towards after being captured by Koerber's magnetic beam is possibly the legendary core of a world that was once supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. This theory is supported by its diameter being 1200 miles, having a mineral and radio-active composition, and gravity similar to seven-eighths of Terra. The fact that it has such strong gravitational pull suggests that it is a large and dense object, which is consistent with the description of a planetary core. It's possible that this world was destroyed or broken apart in the past, leaving only its core behind and creating the asteroid belt where the events of the story take place." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, it is not explicitly stated what exactly happened aboard the wrecked liner that caused the disappearance of Marla Starland, the cargo of radium, and the spacer itself. However, there are some clues that suggest an attack or some kind of destructive event.&#10;&#10;Firstly, the text mentions that the liner had sent distress signals before vanishing, which suggests that it was in a dire situation. Additionally, Commander Bertram mentions to Captain Brooke that the six transports lost in the last month were due to atom-blasts pitting their hulls with deadly Genton shells. This implies that the liner may have been attacked and destroyed by an enemy using such weaponry.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when young George Randall reports the detection of a trail on the new &quot;Jet Analyzers,&quot; Captain Brooke hopes and prays that it is Koerber, suggesting that Koerber is a known pirate or enemy who operates in the dangerous asteroid belt where the wrecked liner disappeared.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the story does not provide explicit details about what happened aboard the wrecked liner, it strongly suggests that it was attacked and destroyed by an enemy using atom-blasts and Genton shells." />
    <node id="1. The chances of repairing the ship using the available beryloid plates are quite low. Scotty mentioned that while there are some beryloid plates in the storage locker, the main rocket feed has been severed due to Koerber's parting shot. This is a critical component for any spacecraft to generate sufficient thrust for takeoff and maneuvering.&#10;2. The crew will likely be stuck on the planetoid indefinitely without assistance from an external source or if they cannot manufacture a new main rocket feed. They used their emergency tank to make it down to the planetoid's surface after the atom-blast penetrated the hull into the forward fuel chambers, and the crash-landing further worsened the damage. With no means of refueling or repairing the main rocket feed, they face a challenging situation.&#10;&#10;In summary, given the significant damage to the ship's hull and main rocket feed, the chances of immediate repair using the available beryloid plates are low. The crew will likely be stranded on the planetoid indefinitely without external assistance or if they cannot manufacture a new main rocket feed." />
    <node id="The story mentions that an interplanetary spacer carrying Marla Starland, the fiancee of Dennis Brooke, and a cargo of radium from Venus has sent distress signals and disappeared on its way from Venus to Terra. The exact circumstances of their disappearance are not provided in the text, but it is heavily implied that something unfortunate has happened to the ship, as all passengers, cargo, and the spacer itself seem to have vanished. This tragedy is the reason why the I.S.P. Commander summoned Dennis Brooke, as he wants him to take up a mission to find out what happened to Marla and the spacer." />
    <node id="1. The disappearance of an interplanetary spacer carrying his fiancée, Marla Starland, and a cargo of radium from Venus has deeply affected Dennis Brooke, causing him to long for solitude. He needs time to coordinate his thoughts in silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not to mention his career.&#10;   &#10;2. The recent boom on Venus due to the discovery of radio-active fields has resulted in a plethora of pleasure palaces and entertainment, which he finds annoying and intrusive. He is uninterested in the seductive advances of a dancer despite being in a notorious pleasure palace.&#10;&#10;3. Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last letter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they never failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as the palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a perpetual wonder—limpid as a child's. This indicates that he is mourning the loss of Marla and his Space career after being grounded, which has left an aching void in him.&#10;&#10;4. The superbly trained faculties of Dennis Brooke can denote the faint vibration of danger, and he becomes instantly alert as he tries to puzzle the sudden enmity of this Martian stranger. This suggests that he is also on high alert for any danger that may come his way.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dennis Brooke's longing for solitude is due to the disappearance of his fiancée and the cargo ship, the annoyance of the commercialization of Venus during its boom period, and his mourning of the loss of Marla and his Space career. His lack of interest in the dancer's advances is likely due to his focus on coping with these losses and his desire for solitude." />
    <node id="Based on the story, the exact fate of the interplanetary liner carrying Marla Starland and a cargo of radium from Venus is not provided. We know that the ship sent distress signals and ultimately disappeared between Venus and Terra. The cargo, passengers, and the spacer itself seem to have vanished, implying that something unfortunate has happened to them.&#10;&#10;Captain Dennis Brooke plans to respond to those responsible for the tragedy by taking up a mission to find out what happened to Marla and the spacer. The I.S.P. Commander summoned him specifically because of this incident, as he wants Brooke to investigate and pursue any threats in their new armored cruiser with superior speed.&#10;&#10;At the time the story leaves off, Captain Brooke has just received news of the sixth transport loss and is preparing to leave &quot;right now, if he wishes.&quot; He suspects that pirates may be responsible for the disappearance of the spacer, as interplanetary passenger vessels are unlikely to be in the dangerous asteroid belt where the ship vanished." />
    <node id="1. The crew plans to use their available resources to repair the ship and attempt to escape the planetoid's gravity. Scotty suggests looking for deposits of anerioum or uranium to fuel their atom-busters, and the crew begins preparing by breaking out repair plates and getting welders ready.&#10;2. Captain Brooke orders Tom to get the welders ready, indicating that they plan to use them in the repair process. The crew also plans to explore the terrain and try to find out what happened to Koerber's ship, as there may be valuable resources or information there.&#10;3. The crew is highly motivated to escape the planetoid, especially Captain Brooke who expresses a strong desire to &quot;know&quot; what happened to Koerber's ship. This suggests that they will do everything in their power to escape the gravity of the planetoid and continue their mission." />
    <node id="According to the story, there are not many possibilities for what could have caused the atomic disturbance recorded by the Jet Analyzer, other than the trail of a spacer or spacecraft. The text specifically mentions that young George Randall identifies it as such and fears it might be Koerber's pirate ship. The crew also prepares for action, indicating that they suspect a spacecraft in the vicinity. While the story does not explicitly rule out other natural phenomena or objects that could cause atomic disturbances, it strongly suggests that a spacecraft is the most likely cause of the disturbance." />
    <node id="1. To avoid Koerber's magnetic beam and escape from the increasing gravity trap, Dennis Brooke took the desperate measure of maneuvering his ship to avoid the beam, first by making a wrenching turn and then by banking and zooming out of the gravity trap.&#10;2. He called for George Randall's help in doing so. He specifically asked George Randall to cut all jets in the rocket room in order to evade the magnetic beam." />
    <node id="The erratic flight path and the appearance of fatal spots on the passenger spacer's side, as shown on the viso-screen, suggest that the ship was under attack or experiencing some sort of mechanical failure. The swerving and zig-zagging movement of the ship indicate that it was trying to avoid something deadly in space, while the appearance of the fatal spots on its side suggests that the ship was hit by projectiles or energy blasts, causing damage to its hull. This is consistent with the implication that the ship may have been attacked by pirates or hostile forces, which is why Dennis Brooke is being tasked with finding out what happened to his fiancée and the missing spacer." />

We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, where the last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!&quot;&#10; &#10; He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast set on his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. &quot;You'll now see a visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that left Venus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vessel in space. This, Dennis,&quot; the Commander emphasized his words, &quot;is your chance to redeem yourself!&quot; He fell silent, while the viso-screen began to show a crowded" />
    <node id="The speed of their spacecraft is significant because it allows them to search for the missing spacer more efficiently in the vastness of space, especially in the challenging environment beyond the inner planets where they have to contend with stray asteroids and outlaw crews. The crew's new armored cruiser prioritizes speed and fuel efficiency over luxurious appointments, reflecting the urgency and importance of their mission.&#10;&#10;The challenges the crew faces in their search for a phantom ship beyond the inner planets include navigating unfamiliar territory with less support and resources than they are used to, as well as dealing with the psychological strain of searching for something that seems to have vanished without a trace. The erratic flight path and damage to the missing spacer's hull suggest that it may have been under attack by pirates or hostile forces, making the mission even more dangerous and high-stakes.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speed of their spacecraft is crucial for keeping up with the demands of their mission and ensuring they can respond quickly to any threats or emergencies they encounter along the way." />

Get the figures and data from the coordination room, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.&quot; He extended his hand. &quot;You're the best spacer we have—aside from your recklessness—and on your success depends far more than the capture of an outlaw.&quot; Bertram smiled thinly. &quot;Happy landing!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; Their nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a phantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally elusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of fathomless space.&#10; &#10; To all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first assignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the inner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance against stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even their cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked the luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol spacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was hoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space" />
    <node id="when a Martian stranger (revealed to be named Hellacorium) becomes enraged after a Mercurian Dancer tries to seduce Dennis Brooke, he leaps onto the table and knocks it over in his haste to attack Brooke. However, Brooke is able to avoid the Martian's initial attack by jumping out of the way and then swiftly plants a sledgehammer blow in Hellacorium's vulnerable spot, just below their narrow waist. He follows this with a jab to the chin that staggerers Hellacorium, but the Martian is not yet defeated. Despite being in excruciating pain, he continues to attack Brooke with a powerful punch to the chest. However, Brooke stands his ground and fights back with all his force, landing a hit to Hellacorium's jaw that spins him around and leaves him sagging to the floor.&#10;&#10;Dennis Brooke then stands over the defeated Martian until the international police arrive. Upon searching Hellacorium, the police find a tiny but powerful bomb hidden on his person, revealing that he was responsible for the disappearance of the interplanetary spacer carrying Marla Starland and a cargo of radium from Venus. The story implies that Hellacorium had planned to use the bomb to destroy the spacer and its valuable cargo in order to profit from the disaster." />
    <node id="1. Randall was initially missing from his battle station in the rocket room, and it is revealed that he had asked Captain Brooke if he could help Scotty with a welding job instead. However, it is unclear whether he was explicitly excused from his duties or if he neglected them on his own accord.&#10;2. When faced with Randall's request, Captain Brooke initially expressed anger, but when he saw the young crew member's frightened and remorseful appearance, his emotions softened. He realized that this was Randall's first trip into outer space, and it was natural for him to feel overwhelmed in such a situation. Despite his initial anger, Captain Brooke responded kindly and allowed Randall to help with the emergency situation." />
    <node id="1. Efficient Search: The high speed of their spacecraft allows the crew to cover a larger area of space more quickly, increasing their chances of finding the missing spacer and the pirate ship.&#10;&#10;2. Responding to Threats: A faster spaceship ensures that the crew can respond to any emergencies or threats they encounter during their search, such as stray asteroids or hostile forces.&#10;&#10;3. Outpacing Pirates: The superior speed of their new armored cruiser gives them an advantage in catching up to and engaging with the elusive pirate ship, which is crucial for bringing those responsible for the vanished spacer to justice.&#10;&#10;4. Keeping Up with Demands: The urgency and importance of their mission require that they maintain a high pace in order to fulfill their responsibilities and protect space travelers from threats like piracy.&#10;&#10;5. Psychological Factors: The speed of the spaceship can help alleviate some of the psychological strain on the crew during their long and challenging search, as it allows them to feel more proactive and responsive in their efforts to find the missing ship and capture the pirate." />
    <node id="The source of surprise for Dennis Brooke was the discovery by the international police of a forbidden atomic-disintegrator weapon on the unconscious Martian youth. This suggests that the Martian is a member of a notorious pirate crew, which was an unexpected revelation for Dennis." />

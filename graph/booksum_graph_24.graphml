    <node id=" The narrator's kindness plays a significant role in their relationship with Jane. Despite his initial gruff demeanor, Mr. Rochester eventually reveals his softer side to Jane, showing that he values her companionship and emotional support. This is evident when he becomes emotional after Jane refuses his proposal, and she responds by showing him kindness and forgiveness.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's remorse and vulnerability in this moment humanize him in Jane's eyes, and she cannot help but forgive him. This act of kindness further strengthens their bond, as it demonstrates Jane's loyalty and compassion towards Mr. Rochester. It also highlights the power dynamics between them, with Jane willingly submitting to his emotional needs despite his initial rejection of her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester's kindness towards Jane throughout the novel, such as when he saves her from being trampled by his horse and provides her with an education, has already endeared him to her. Therefore, when he shows vulnerability and remorse, Jane's feelings towards him are further solidified, making it even more difficult for her to reject his proposal.&#10;&#10;Overall, kindness plays a crucial role in the relationship between Mr. Rochester and Jane, as it fosters a deep sense of loyalty, compassion, and emotional connection between them. However, it also creates an imbalance of power, making it challenging for Jane to assert her own desires and agency in the face of Mr. Rochester's emotional needs." />

Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but&#10;I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane! Jane!&quot; he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled&#10;along every nerve I had; &quot;you don't love me, then?  It was only my&#10;station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me&#10;disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I&#10;were some toad or ape.&quot;&#10;&#10;These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to&#10;have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at&#10;thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm&#10;where I had wounded.&#10;&#10;&quot;I _do_ love you,&quot; I said, &quot;more than ever: but I must not" />

Then came a&#10;deep, strong sob.&#10;&#10;I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as&#10;determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face&#10;from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my&#10;hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;God bless you, my dear master!&quot; I said.  &quot;God keep you from harm and&#10;wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,&quot; he answered;&#10;&quot;without it," />

I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the&#10;March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its&#10;lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent&#10;woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you could not marry, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not&#10;my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to&#10;tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me&#10;so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be&#10;loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to&#10;understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was&#10;burdened.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me" />

Not a human being&#10;that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him&#10;who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and&#10;idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--&quot;Depart!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, you understand what I want of you?

    <node id=" The text describes a situation where Jane, the narrator, has become physically ill and emotionally overwhelmed after refusing Mr. Rochester's proposal. She feels guilty for resisting him, as her conscience and reason turn against her, telling her to comply with his wishes. Jane becomes so sick that Mr. Rochester carries her downstairs to the library, where he tends to her by providing her with wine and food.&#10;&#10;During this time, Jane reflects on her situation, feeling isolated and neglected by those around her. She thinks about how she must leave Mr. Rochester, even though she does not want to, and contemplates the idea of leaving this world without causing him any more pain. The room is described as being cloudy to her glazed sight, highlighting her sense of disorientation and despair.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text describes a situation in which Jane has become physically and emotionally isolated, reflecting on her state of sickness and neglect from others. This moment serves to further emphasize the deep emotional connection between Jane and Mr. Rochester, as well as the power dynamics at play in their relationship." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,&#10;which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer&#10;it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is&#10;a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant&#10;contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,&#10;Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this&#10;moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your&#10;heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,&#10;my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very&#10;natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter&#10;have free advent--my arms wait to receive her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was&#10;all that intervened between me and the gulf.

At&#10;first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my&#10;glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer&#10;as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;&#10;I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon&#10;myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.&#10;&quot;If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be&#10;well for me,&quot; I thought; &quot;then I should not have to make the effort of&#10;cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.

I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave&#10;him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How are you now, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Taste the wine again, Jane.&quot;" />

    <node id="Your father, Mr. Rochester's, primary reason for sending him to Jamaica to marry Miss Mason was not explicitly mentioned in the given narrative. However, it can be inferred that your father's avaricious nature played a significant role in his decision. He wanted to keep the family property intact and ensure that his son, Rowland, did not inherit a divided estate. At the same time, he could not bear the idea of leaving you without a fair portion. Therefore, he aimed to provide for you by arranging a wealthy marriage.&#10;&#10;Your father's admiration for Miss Mason's beauty might have been genuine, but it was also strategic in nature, as her wealth and family background made her a desirable match for his son. He sought a partner who could secure a comfortable life for his son while ensuring the wealth remained within the family. The fact that your father did not mention Miss Mason's wealth to you suggests that he wanted you to be attracted to her beauty, social status, and family connections rather than her financial situation, so as to avoid any suspicion regarding his true intentions behind the arranged marriage." />

I&#10;must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner&#10;betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old&#10;acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made&#10;inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned&#10;from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty&#10;thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to&#10;Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.

I found her a fine&#10;woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her&#10;family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.&#10;They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her&#10;alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered&#10;me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and&#10;accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy&#10;me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being&#10;ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no&#10;folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,&#10;the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its&#10;commission.

    <node id=" The man in question is Mr. Rochester from Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; After marrying Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester discovers that she has severe mental health issues and a violent criminal background. Driven by his sense of duty and self-respect, he decides to separate himself emotionally and physically from her, even though they are married.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's avaricious father had arranged the marriage with Bertha Mason primarily due to her wealth, and Mr. Rochester feels trapped in this unhappy union. Despite being five years her senior, he knows that Bertha is likely to live as long as he does due to her robust health, further complicating his feelings of hopelessness.&#10;&#10;The man's desperation arises from the turmoil caused by his unfulfilling marriage and his inability to break free from it entirely. He is torn between his moral obligation to remain faithful to Bertha and his desire for companionship and love with someone worthy of him. This inner conflict, combined with the constant reminder of Bertha's presence and her haunting memories, ultimately leaves him feeling hopeless at the age of twenty-six." />

    <node id=" Jane, the protagonist, is unable to reveal her love to Mr. Rochester before leaving due to her strong sense of duty and moral obligation towards him. Although she deeply loves Mr. Rochester, she believes that marrying him would be wrong because of his existing marriage to Bertha Mason, which he cannot legally or ethically leave. Jane also recognizes the power dynamic between them, as she does not want to be a source of comfort for Mr. Rochester out of pity or obligation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Jane's refusal to become Mr. Rochester's companion is rooted in her desire for self-respect and independence. She wants to build her life based on equality and mutual respect, which she does not believe can be achieved in her current situation with Mr. Rochester. By leaving him, she hopes to preserve their deep emotional bond while remaining true to herself and her principles.&#10;&#10;Jane's physical and emotional illness during this scene further highlights the turmoil and guilt she experiences because of her decision to leave Mr. Rochester. Her love for him makes it difficult for her to separate from him, but her commitment to doing what is right ultimately outweighs her personal desires." />
    <node id=" The speaker, Jane, considers taking her own life due to the intense emotional turmoil she experiences after refusing Mr. Rochester's proposal. She feels isolated, neglected, and overwhelmed by guilt for resisting him. This despair is so intense that it affects her physically, causing her to become sick and disoriented.&#10;&#10;However, Jane ultimately changes her mind because of the kindness and forgiveness she shows towards Mr. Rochester in his moment of vulnerability. Despite his gruff demeanor, Jane recognizes that he needs emotional support and responds with compassion. This act of kindness not only strengthens their bond but also helps Jane see Mr. Rochester's humanity, making it more difficult for her to reject him completely.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Jane's belief in God and her strong sense of self-reliance give her the strength to endure hardships and make difficult decisions. She encourages Mr. Rochester to live a sinless life and find hope in heaven, but she also remains firm in her own convictions, refusing to yield to his demands.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's extreme circumstances lead her to consider taking her own life due to the emotional turmoil caused by Mr. Rochester's proposal. However, she ultimately changes her mind because of her kindness, compassion, and strong sense of self-reliance. These qualities help her recognize Mr. Rochester's humanity, strengthen their bond, and give her the strength to endure difficult situations." />

She feels overwhelmed by guilt for resisting him and is physically affected by her despair, becoming sick and disoriented. Jane contemplates leaving this world without causing Mr. Rochester any more pain. However, she quickly changes her mind because of the kindness and forgiveness she shows towards Mr. Rochester in his moment of vulnerability. Jane's act of compassion not only strengthens their bond but also helps her see Mr. Rochester's humanity, making it more difficult for her to reject him completely.

Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was&#10;wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was&#10;haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all&#10;knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never&#10;would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was&#10;housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac&#10;elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more&#10;retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely&#10;enough," />

Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame&#10;of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with&#10;disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against&#10;all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,&#10;faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came&#10;back to England.&#10;&#10;&quot;On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.&#10;Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in&#10;Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as&#10;negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no&#10;presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the&#10;arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble&#10;guise.

I&#10;rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew&#10;where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking&#10;these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester&#10;had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it&#10;was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I&#10;made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I&#10;had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,&#10;took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole&#10;from my room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!&quot; I whispered, as I glided past her door.&#10;&quot;Farewell, my darling Adele!&quot; I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.&#10;No thought could be admitted of entering" />

But I'll&#10;shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower&#10;windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my&#10;wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and&#10;she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her&#10;company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms," />
    <node id=" Mr. Rochester spent ten years traveling across various European capitals, including St. Petersburg, Paris, Rome, Naples, Florence, and others. He was looking for his ideal woman among English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen. Despite not seeking perfection, he could not find a woman he liked enough to ask for her hand in marriage during this period.&#10;&#10;He had encounters with mistresses, such as Celine Varens, an Italian named Giacinta, and a German named Clara, all of whom were considered handsome. However, their beauty quickly lost its appeal for him. Eventually, he grew tired of the companionship of mistresses and sought a more meaningful connection with someone who could understand his situation despite being cursed.&#10;&#10;When Jane asks if Mr. Rochester had found someone he liked and asked her to marry him, he reveals that he did not find anyone suitable during his decade-long search for a partner. He had hoped to meet a good and intelligent woman who would be willing to accept him with his burden." />

Provided with plenty of money and the&#10;passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were&#10;closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,&#10;French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not&#10;find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,&#10;heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:&#10;but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired&#10;perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited&#10;me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them&#10;all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings" />
    <node id=" I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have&#10;asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried&#10;dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my&#10;Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me&#10;much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to&#10;approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.&#10;The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a&#10;man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,&#10;and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an&#10;Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly&#10;handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was&#10;unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three" />
    <node id=" Despite Mr. Rochester's desperate pleas and expressions of love, Jane must follow her strong sense of duty, morality, and self-respect. She refuses to become his comforter or rescuer out of pity, and she does not want to be a source of comfort based on an unequal power dynamic. Jane also wants to maintain her independence and build her life on equality and mutual respect, which she believes cannot be achieved in her current situation with Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Jane's love for Mr. Rochester makes it difficult for her to separate from him, but her commitment to doing what is right ultimately outweighs her personal desires. She understands that marrying Mr. Rochester would be wrong due to his existing marriage to Bertha Mason, which he cannot legally or ethically leave. Jane's moral and ethical convictions, along with her belief in God and her strong sense of self-reliance, give her the strength to endure hardships and make difficult decisions, allowing her to remain firm in her conviction to leave Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id=" even if Jane were to stay with him, their marriage would not be possible due to his existing union with Bertha Mason, who is still alive and cannot be divorced legally or ethically. Therefore, Mr. Rochester's hope for companionship and understanding from a good and intelligent woman seems unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future.&#10;&#10;As for his happiness, it is evident that Mr. Rochester deeply loves Jane, and her departure will undoubtedly cause him immense sorrow and emotional pain. His anguish over Jane's rejection is already apparent when he sobs on the sofa after she refuses him. This moment demonstrates Mr. Rochester's vulnerability and the depth of his feelings for Jane, which further highlights the power dynamics between them and the significance of Jane's decision to leave him despite her own emotional turmoil.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, with only a mad wife to keep him company, Mr. Rochester's life will likely become increasingly isolated and lonely. The absence of meaningful relationships and companionship is likely to exacerbate his feelings of despair, making it difficult for him to find happiness or fulfillment in his current circumstances.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's departure will significantly impact Mr. Rochester's life and happiness, leaving him with few options for companionship and understanding in a loveless marriage to a mentally ill wife." />
    <node id=" me!&quot; burst involuntarily from my lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a fool!&quot; cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  &quot;I keep telling her I am&#10;not married, and do not explain to her why.

Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in&#10;opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,&#10;Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove&#10;you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the&#10;case.  Can you listen to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; for hours if you will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the&#10;eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have understood something to that effect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane," />
    <node id=" In this passage, the speaker, Mr. Rochester, expresses his deep affection for Jane. He states that every part of her flesh is as dear to him as his own, meaning he values and cherishes her physical being just as much as he values himself. He also says that her mind is his treasure, indicating that he highly regards her intellect and personality. Furthermore, he emphasizes that even if she were mad, he would still care for her deeply, reflecting his unwavering commitment to her well-being.

I should not&#10;shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you&#10;should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you&#10;with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and&#10;never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of&#10;recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?

I turned my face away and&#10;put his aside.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!--How is this?&quot; he exclaimed hastily.  &quot;Oh, I know! you won't kiss&#10;the husband of Bertha Mason?

His irritation towards the idea of solitude stems from his inner turmoil and desire for companionship; he sees Adele as an unwanted burden rather than a source of comfort, further fueling his frustration with the idea of solitude.

When I think of the&#10;thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet&#10;visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what, sir,&quot; I asked, while he paused, &quot;did you do when you had&#10;settled her here?

    <node id=" The narrator, Jane, is not explicitly going on a physical journey in the given text. Instead, she is experiencing an emotional journey as she grapples with her feelings after refusing Mr. Rochester's proposal. Jane becomes physically ill and emotionally overwhelmed, causing her to avoid reflecting on the past or future. This state of mind allows her to focus on surviving the present moment and making a difficult decision about her future without the influence of past experiences or future anxieties. By avoiding reflections or thoughts about the past or future, Jane is able to concentrate on her immediate needs and emotions, which ultimately helps her regain her strength and reaffirm her convictions." />
    <node id=" Jane does not express her feelings and confront Mr. Rochester with anger because she does not want to accuse, upbraid, or make a scene. She is thinking about how to act, rather than talking, which she considers to be of no use at the moment. Jane also wants to avoid making Mr. Rochester angry, as she knows he would not like to see her weep. However, after crying heartily and hearing his entreaties for her to be composed, she realizes that he is not angry but rather loves her too well. This misunderstanding stems from Jane's desire to manage the situation delicately, demonstrating her thoughtful and considerate nature." />

But I&#10;err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but&#10;no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?&#10;Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?

What do you say to&#10;that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,&#10;and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you&#10;cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the&#10;flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke&#10;much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:&#10;you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I&#10;know you--I am on my guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, I do not wish to act against you,&quot; I said; and my unsteady voice&#10;warned me to curtail my sentence.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not in" />

    <node id=" In the narrative, the speaker, who is never explicitly named but referred to as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;Mr.,&quot; experiences a disturbing night where he is awakened by the shrieks of his wife, who has been confined due to her madness. The night is described as a typical West Indian night before a hurricane, with hot and sulfurous air, rumbling sea, black clouds casting up over it, and the moon setting in the waves like a hot cannonball.&#10;&#10;The speaker's wife, Bertha Mason, had become intemperate and unchaste due to her madness, causing the speaker great distress and agony. She directs curses towards him with such demonic hate and foul language that no harlot could match. The speaker is physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, his ears filled with the curses she shrieks out.&#10;&#10;The spiritual figure of the moon delivers a message of warning to Jane, urging her to flee temptation.

The doctors have discovered that she is mad, and her excesses have prematurely developed the germs of insanity.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the speaker's disturbing night is filled with intense fear, anger, and despair caused by his wife's madness and destructive behavior, amplified by the ominous hurricane-like atmosphere outside." />

Of the fanatic's burning eternity&#10;I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present&#10;one--let me break away, and go home to God!'&#10;&#10;&quot;I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained&#10;a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.

    <node id="&#09;In this passage, the speaker, Jane Eyre, is in a state of physical illness and emotional distress after refusing Mr. Rochester's proposal. She feels guilty for resisting him and is overwhelmed with despair, leading her to consider ending her own life. However, she quickly changes her mind due to her compassion towards Mr. Rochester and her strong sense of self-reliance.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester has carried Jane downstairs to the library, where he tends to her by providing her with wine and food, indicating that she is being cared for by him in this moment of distress. The room is described as having a fire, suggesting a warm and comforting environment. Jane's physical condition improves after tasting the wine and eating something offered to her by Mr. Rochester, further emphasizing his care for her well-being." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester insists on caring for Jane Eyre personally during her illness as a demonstration of his deep concern and affection for her. This action also highlights the power dynamics between them, with Mr. Rochester taking charge in a paternalistic manner while Jane willingly submits to his emotional needs despite her initial resistance.

He cherishes every part of her flesh as dear to him as his own and values her mind as his treasure. Despite knowing about her objections due to his existing marriage, he becomes deeply anguished when she refuses him, indicating the intensity of his feelings for her.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Mr. Rochester may be aware of Jane's emotional turmoil and her previous suicidal thoughts. By asking her to stay one more night, he might be trying to protect her from herself or give her time to reconsider her decision to leave. Ultimately, Mr. Rochester's insistence on caring for Jane personally and his request for her to stay one more night reflect the depth of his love and concern for her, despite their complicated circumstances." />
    <node id=" The question refers to a part of the narrative where Jane and Mr. Rochester have not yet fully developed their relationship, and it focuses on their interactions in the schoolroom before Jane knows about his emotional vulnerability. Based on the supporting materials provided, there is no mention of any &quot;chance meetings in the schoolroom&quot; where the narrator's kindness played a significant role in changing Jane's behavior or emotions.&#10;&#10;However, if you are referring to Mr. Rochester's kindness towards Jane during their encounters in the schoolroom, then it can be said that his acts of kindness, such as providing her with an education and saving her from being trampled by his horse, played a significant role in endearing him to Jane and influencing her feelings towards him.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's kind actions created a strong emotional bond between them, making it difficult for Jane to reject his proposal even after learning about his existing marriage. Furthermore, his vulnerability and remorse after Jane refused his proposal led Jane to show kindness and forgiveness towards him, further strengthening their bond despite the power imbalance in their relationship." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester turned to the companionship of mistresses after failing to find a suitable partner to marry during his decade-long search in various European capitals. His frustration and disappointment led him to seek comfort and affection from women like Celine Varens, an Italian named Giacinta, and a German named Clara. However, he eventually grew tired of their company as the beauty of these mistresses quickly lost its appeal for him.&#10;&#10;Regarding his relationships with these three women, they were all considered handsome and likely provided temporary satisfaction for Mr. Rochester's desire for companionship. It is important to note that while he did engage in dissipation, it was not debauchery, as he despised such behavior. These relationships ultimately proved unsatisfying, leading him back to his initial search for a more meaningful connection with someone who could understand his situation despite being cursed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Rochester's relationships with Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara were unfulfilling encounters that did not lead to marriage or long-term companionship. His disappointment in these relationships contributed to his growing disillusionment with the companionship of mistresses, further emphasizing his desire for a genuine connection with a good and intelligent woman who would accept him with his burden." />
    <edge source=" The narrator's kindness plays a significant role in their relationship with Jane. Despite his initial gruff demeanor, Mr. Rochester eventually reveals his softer side to Jane, showing that he values her companionship and emotional support.

This act of kindness further strengthens their bond, as it demonstrates Jane's loyalty and compassion towards Mr. Rochester. It also highlights the power dynamics between them, with Jane willingly submitting to his emotional needs despite his initial rejection of her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester's kindness towards Jane throughout the novel, such as when he saves her from being trampled by his horse and provides her with an education, has already endeared him to her. Therefore, when he shows vulnerability and remorse, Jane's feelings towards him are further solidified, making it even more difficult for her to reject his proposal.&#10;&#10;Overall, kindness plays a crucial role in the relationship between Mr. Rochester and Jane, as it fosters a deep sense of loyalty, compassion, and emotional connection between them.

Despite not seeking perfection, he could not find a woman he liked enough to ask for her hand in marriage during this period.&#10;&#10;He had encounters with mistresses, such as Celine Varens, an Italian named Giacinta, and a German named Clara, all of whom were considered handsome. However, their beauty quickly lost its appeal for him. Eventually, he grew tired of the companionship of mistresses and sought a more meaningful connection with someone who could understand his situation despite being cursed.&#10;&#10;When Jane asks if Mr. Rochester had found someone he liked and asked her to marry him, he reveals that he did not find anyone suitable during his decade-long search for a partner. He had hoped to meet a good and intelligent woman who would be willing to accept him with his burden.">

She directs curses towards him with such demonic hate and foul language that no harlot could match. The speaker is physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, his ears filled with the curses she shrieks out.&#10;&#10;The spiritual figure of the moon delivers a message of warning to Jane, urging her to flee temptation. However, it's unclear what specific temptation the message refers to in this passage.&#10;&#10;The speaker is burdened by his association with Bertha Mason and cannot rid himself of her legally due to her madness. The doctors have discovered that she is mad, and her excesses have prematurely developed the germs of insanity.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the speaker's disturbing night is filled with intense fear, anger, and despair caused by his wife's madness and destructive behavior, amplified by the ominous hurricane-like atmosphere outside.">

His irritation towards the idea of solitude stems from his inner turmoil and desire for companionship; he sees Adele as an unwanted burden rather than a source of comfort, further fueling his frustration with the idea of solitude.

This action also highlights the power dynamics between them, with Mr. Rochester taking charge in a paternalistic manner while Jane willingly submits to his emotional needs despite her initial resistance. By providing wine and food, he creates a warm and comforting environment that further emphasizes his care for her well-being.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mr. Rochester requests that Jane stay one more night at Thornfield because he is not ready to let her go. He cherishes every part of her flesh as dear to him as his own and values her mind as his treasure.

Thus, while Grace Poole has been employed as the caretaker for the lunatic, her job performance has not been without flaws, and she has allowed the dangerous inmate to engage in harmful behaviors that put others at risk.">

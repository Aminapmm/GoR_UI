    <node id="John Eyre is a uncle of Jane Eyre, who lives in Madeira and has recently come into a fortune. He is unmarried and childless, and he wants to adopt Jane during his lifetime and bequeath his wealth to her after his death. This information is revealed in a letter that Jane reads, which was written by John Eyre to Mrs. Reed, the head of Jane's childhood home, Lowood. In the letter, John Eyre requests the address and well-being of his niece Jane Eyre, as he intends to write to her and invite her to Madeira. It is worth noting that Jane has never met or heard of this uncle before, and their connection is only through their shared last name." />
    <node id=" painful.&quot;&#10;&#10;She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;&#10;she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,&#10;of the last pang.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell&#10;her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see&#10;there.&quot;&#10;&#10;I obeyed her directions.  &quot;Read the letter,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;It was short, and thus conceived:--&#10;&#10;   &quot;Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my&#10;   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to&#10;   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has&#10;   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried&#10;   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at&#10;   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&#10;&#10;   &quot;JOHN EYRE, Madeira.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Who--I?&quot; was her answer.  &quot;Who are you?&quot; looking at me with surprise and&#10;a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  &quot;You are quite a stranger to&#10;me--where is Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is at the lodge, aunt.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aunt,&quot; she repeated.  &quot;Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the&#10;Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are&#10;quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!&quot;&#10;&#10;I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my&#10;identity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet,&quot; said she, &quot;I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I&#10;wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:&#10;besides, in eight years she must be so changed.&quot;  I now gently assured&#10;her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing&#10;that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I&#10;explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield" />
    <node id="poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She&#10;was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather&#10;better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making&#10;signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,&#10;that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she&#10;made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to&#10;her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means&#10;anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and&#10;advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but&#10;their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,&#10;that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can&#10;get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow&#10;morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and&#10;child are thriving.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And are the family well at the house, Robert?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very&#10;badly at present--in great trouble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope no one is dead,&quot; I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too&#10;looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how does his mother bear it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been&#10;very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and&#10;his death was shocking.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst" />
    <node id=" said she; &quot;don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are&#10;you Jane Eyre?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such&#10;a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,&#10;daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden&#10;starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's&#10;movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a&#10;fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her&#10;away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever&#10;broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:&#10;but I said she did--I wish she had died!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only&#10;sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning&#10;her when she made her low marriage" />
    <node id=" it.  You go to-morrow,&#10;then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; early.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose so, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm&#10;not quite up to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then say it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What must I say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The same, if you like, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like&#10;something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane" />
    <node id="On your visit to the lodge, Bessie expresses surprise and uncertainty about your identity, but you gently confirm that you are Jane Eyre. She becomes emotional, recalling how she had hoped to see you again. You explain that Bessie's husband, Mr. Leaven, brought you from Thornfield Hall after Bessie received her letter.&#10;&#10;You then describe your life at Thornfield Hall, mentioning the recent guests who stayed there and sharing details that Bessie finds interesting. After an hour of conversation, Bessie prepares tea for you, serving you at the fireside just as she used to when you were a child. This brings back old memories, making you feel like you have returned to familiar times.&#10;&#10;Bessie tells you that Mrs. Reed is alive but in a critical state, expecting to live only a week or two more. Mrs. Reed had been talking about you just that morning and wished for your presence. Bessie invites you to rest at the lodge for an hour before they both go up to the house together." />
    <node id=" peremptory tones.  I must be served at the&#10;fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my&#10;cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with&#10;some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and&#10;obeyed her as in bygone days.&#10;&#10;She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a&#10;person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,&#10;whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was&#10;rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,&#10;and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company&#10;that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie&#10;listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.&#10;&#10;In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my&#10;bonnet, &amp;c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.&#10;It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years" />
    <node id=" &amp;c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.&#10;It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked&#10;down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in&#10;January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered&#10;heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly&#10;harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same&#10;hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;&#10;and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of&#10;the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,&#10;and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,&#10;too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.&#10;&#10;&quot;You shall go into the breakfast-room first,&quot; said Bessie, as she&#10;preceded me through the hall; &quot;the young ladies will be there.&quot;&#10;&#10;In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article&#10;of furniture looking" />
    <node id=" one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word&#10;as in many.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?&quot; I asked&#10;myself; &quot;I want to commence my packing.&quot;  The dinner-bell rang, and&#10;suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more&#10;during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.&#10;&#10;I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of&#10;the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was&#10;very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white&#10;curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished&#10;bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her&#10;last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly" />
    <node id=" here an hour, Miss,&#10;and then I will go up with you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and&#10;went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet&#10;and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to&#10;accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling&#10;garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.&#10;&#10;Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting&#10;out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting&#10;a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an&#10;occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.&#10;Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good&#10;looks.&#10;&#10;Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit&#10;still, quite in her old peremptory tones.

How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The&#10;doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she&#10;will finally recover.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Has she mentioned me lately?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,&#10;but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the&#10;house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and&#10;wakes up about six or seven.

    <node id=" In the face that Jane Eyre sketched, she included a broad and prominent forehead, a square lower outline of visage, strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows, a well-defined nose with a straight ridge and full nostrils, a flexible-looking mouth, a firm chin with a decided cleft down the middle, some black whiskers, and jetty hair tufted on the temples and waved above the forehead. She decided on these specific features as they occurred to her naturally while sketching, with the exception of the whiskers and waved hair, which she added to give the face a more masculine appearance. The face she was sketching turned out to be a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester, although she lied and told others it was merely a fancy head." />

I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad&#10;point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and&#10;prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour&#10;gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.&#10;Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then&#10;followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full&#10;nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm&#10;chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black&#10;whiskers" />
    <node id=", by no means narrow; then a firm&#10;chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black&#10;whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and&#10;waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,&#10;because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I&#10;shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids&#10;lustrous and large.  &quot;Good! but not quite the thing,&quot; I thought, as I&#10;surveyed the effect: &quot;they want more force and spirit;&quot; and I wrought the&#10;shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy&#10;touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my&#10;gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs&#10;on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed&#10;and content.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;" />
    <node id=" a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in&#10;fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that&#10;to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The&#10;other drawings pleased her much, but she called that &quot;an ugly man.&quot; They&#10;both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;&#10;and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her&#10;album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at&#10;once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we&#10;had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she&#10;had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent&#10;in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the&#10;attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.&#10;She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade&#10;everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well&#10;as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at&#10;first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and&#10;scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would&#10;chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of&#10;me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or&#10;amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me&#10;for both.&#10;&#10;Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take&#10;a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching&#10;fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to&#10;shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse&#10;of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;&#10;a group" />

Eliza and I went to look&#10;at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared&#10;not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,&#10;rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow&#10;and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange&#10;and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and&#10;pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or&#10;subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_&#10;loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a&#10;form.&#10;&#10;Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she&#10;observed--&#10;&#10;&quot;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life&#10;was shortened by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so" />
    <node id=" of vengeance&#10;and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in&#10;bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion&#10;than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to&#10;forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in&#10;amity.&#10;&#10;The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that&#10;peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,&#10;imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and&#10;hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived&#10;as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:&#10;she looked at me.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is this Jane Eyre?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?&quot;&#10;&#10;I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no&#10;sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her&#10;hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should&#10;at that moment" />
    <node id="1. Jane Eyre sketched a portrait of Mr. Rochester without realizing it at first, but she included specific features such as his broad forehead, square jaw, well-defined nose, flexible mouth, firm chin, black whiskers, and jetty hair. She added the whiskers and waved hair to give the face a more masculine appearance.&#10;2. During a walk in the grounds with Georgiana, Jane learned about Georgiana's past through her conversation. Georgiana spent a brilliant winter in London two seasons ago and received much admiration and attention there. She also hinted at making a titled conquest during her time in London. These hints suggested that Georgiana had a successful and exciting social life in the city, attracting the interest of influential and high-ranking individuals." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Early to-morrow morning, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I&#10;daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have&#10;you in the world, Jane?&quot; he asked, smiling.&#10;&#10;I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  &quot;Five shillings, sir.&quot;  He&#10;took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as&#10;if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: &quot;Here,&quot;&#10;said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but&#10;fifteen.  I told him I had no change.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages.&quot;&#10;&#10;I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as&#10;if recollecting something, he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Right, right!  Better not give you" />

Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:&#10;but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; and I will do it now;&quot; and having directed him to the servants'&#10;hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions&#10;of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the&#10;stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:&#10;she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-&#10;room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded&#10;thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their&#10;admirers, were all busied in the game.

It required some courage to&#10;disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not&#10;defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.&#10;She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to&#10;demand, &quot;What can the creeping creature want now?&quot; and when I said, in a&#10;low voice, &quot;Mr. Rochester,&quot; she made a movement as if tempted to order me&#10;away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and&#10;very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure&#10;scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,&#10;and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty&#10;lineaments.&#10;&#10;&quot;Does that person want you?&quot; she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.&#10;Rochester turned to see who the &quot;person&quot; was.

    <node id="1. Plan out your day methodically: The speaker suggests dividing the day into sections and assigning tasks to each section, ensuring that every moment is utilized productively. This will prevent any vacant moments and make you self-reliant.&#10;2. Focus on your own abilities: The speaker encourages the listener to develop a system that relies solely on their own strength and will, rather than seeking support or validation from others.&#10;3. Limit your social interactions: The speaker implies that excessive socializing can lead to idleness. By reducing the time spent on conversations and forging unnecessary dependencies, you can become more independent.&#10;4. Cultivate self-sufficiency: Learn to be content with your own company and not rely on others for amusement or validation. This means embracing solitude and finding ways to entertain yourself without external stimuli.&#10;5. Prepare for adversity: The speaker urges the listener to become independent so that they can face any challenges or hardships alone, without having to depend on anyone else's help or sympathy.&#10;6. Set boundaries: The listener is advised to make firm decisions and stick to them, as demonstrated when Jane refuses to promise a specific duration for her stay at Gateshead. This shows independence and self-assurance." />

Her own fortune she had&#10;taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly&#10;improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or&#10;linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a&#10;retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from&#10;disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous&#10;world.

Although he made a &quot;curious grimace&quot; and seemed annoyed at the interruption, his desire to speak with Jane prompted him to leave the game. Miss Ingram, who was playing billiards with Rochester and several other people, reacted haughtily to Jane's approach, emphasizing the social distance between them. Despite this reaction, Rochester chose to attend to Jane's message, indicating the importance of their conversation." />
    <node id=" Based on the account given, we can infer that the woman had a very structured daily routine. She woke up early with the help of an alarm and divided her time into regular portions, dedicating each hour to a specific task. Her activities included studying a Common Prayer Book three times a day, stitching a cloth for an altar cover with gold thread, writing in her diary, working in the kitchen-garden, and managing her accounts. She seemed content with this routine, as any incident that forced her to vary its clockwork regularity annoyed her. Her apparent source of happiness was her self-sufficiency, punctual habits, and focus on personal tasks rather than seeking company or conversation. Additionally, she derived satisfaction from religious devotion, working on the altar cloth for a new church, and maintaining her accounts, indicating a sense of purpose and accomplishment in her daily life." />

I know not how she occupied herself before&#10;breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular&#10;portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she&#10;studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer&#10;Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and&#10;she said, &quot;the Rubric.&quot;  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold&#10;thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a&#10;carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she&#10;informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately&#10;erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to&#10;working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of&#10;her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.

The&#10;communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same&#10;theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once&#10;adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the&#10;present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly&#10;taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after&#10;dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her&#10;mother's sick-room, and no more.&#10;&#10;Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.

She did this because she could not endure the thought of the speaker being adopted by her uncle and living in ease and comfort. Mrs. Reed believes the speaker was born to be her torment because she held a grudge against the speaker's mother for marrying a man below her social status, and the speaker's presence and behavior served as a constant reminder of that." />

I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered&#10;tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and&#10;sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her&#10;longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice&#10;murmured from the couch behind: &quot;Who is that?&quot;&#10;&#10;I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?

    <node id=" The woman being referred to in this narrative is most likely Mr. Rochester's housekeeper at his estate, Thornfield Hall. The passage does not explicitly name her, but she is described as a diligent and self-sufficient person who values routine.&#10;&#10;Her daily activities include waking up early with the help of an alarm, studying a Common Prayer Book three times a day, stitching a cloth for an altar cover with gold thread, writing in her diary, working in the kitchen-garden, and managing her accounts. &#10;&#10;The Common Prayer Book is significant to her because she finds &quot;the Rubric&quot; particularly attractive. In the context of Anglican liturgy, the term 'rubric' refers to the directions given in red print indicating how the service should be conducted. This suggests that the woman places great importance on following established religious practices and rules.&#10;&#10;She is also working on a cloth covering for the altar of a new church near Gateshead. This task is not only time-consuming, requiring three hours of her day, but it also has spiritual significance as it contributes to the furnishing of a place of worship. &#10;&#10;Overall, the woman's daily activities reflect her interests in religion, self-discipline, and productivity." />
    <node id=" through the hall; &quot;the young ladies will be there.&quot;&#10;&#10;In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article&#10;of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced&#10;to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the&#10;hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two&#10;volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third&#10;shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.&#10;The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered&#10;past recognition.&#10;&#10;Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as&#10;Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There&#10;was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme&#10;plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen&#10;collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a&#10;string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though&#10;I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that" />
    <node id="The aunt's attitude towards Jane Eyre changed from patience to anger in nine years likely due to a build-up of resentment and bitterness. This was triggered by Jane's connection to Jane's mother, who married a man below her social status, something that Mrs. Reed strongly disapproved of. Jane's presence and behavior served as constant reminders of this, leading Mrs. Reed to hold a grudge against her.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed's anger towards Jane was further exacerbated when she took revenge by falsely claiming that Jane had died of typhus fever at Lowood, as she could not endure the thought of Jane being adopted by Mr. Eyre and living in ease and comfort. This act of vengeance suggests that Mrs. Reed was unwilling to let go of her grudge against Jane and her family, further explaining her refusal to reconcile with Jane despite Jane's earnest desire for forgiveness and attempts at affection.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the power dynamic between them played a role in their strained relationship. As Jane's guardian, Mrs. Reed held a position of authority over her, which was reflected in her stern and relentless demeanor towards Jane. Jane's attempts to bridge the gap between them were likely seen as a challenge to Mrs. Reed's power and authority, further fueling her anger and resentment towards Jane." />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre is a young woman who was left in the care of her uncle's family after her parents died. However, she was cast off by her aunt, Mrs. Reed, because of her poverty and burdensome nature. She has a connection to Mrs. Reed through her uncle, Mr. Reed, who was a magistrate of Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Jane has been sent for by Mrs. Reed because she is on her deathbed and wants to speak to Jane about some things on her mind. Mrs. Reed's request for Jane to stay with her until they can talk may suggest that she has something important to discuss or reveal to Jane before she passes away. It is also possible that Mrs. Reed is feeling regretful or guilty about how she treated Jane in the past and wants to make amends before she dies.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide further details about what Mrs. Reed wants to talk about, but it is worth noting that this encounter may have significant implications for Jane's future, as it could potentially lead to a change in her circumstances or relationships." />
    <node id=" tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their&#10;source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over&#10;the pillow.&#10;&#10;&quot;You sent for me,&quot; I said, &quot;and I am here; and it is my intention to stay&#10;till I see how you get on.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things&#10;over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a&#10;difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to&#10;say--let me see--&quot;&#10;&#10;The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place&#10;in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes&#10;round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she&#10;was at once irritated.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sit up!&quot; said she; &quot;don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are&#10;you Jane Eyre?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre and Miss Reed (Mrs. Reed's daughter) did not cry after receiving the news about the death of Mrs. Reed, even though it was customary to shed tears during such occasions. The narrative suggests that their emotional state was more complex than simple sadness or grief.&#10;&#10;Jane describes her own reaction as one of &quot;gloom and pain&quot; but not for the loss of Mrs. Reed, whom she did not feel pity or hope towards. Instead, she felt a &quot;grating anguish for _her_ woes,&quot; suggesting that she felt sympathy for Mrs. Reed's suffering rather than sadness for her death. Jane's reaction is consistent with their strained relationship and the fact that Mrs. Reed had mistreated her in the past.&#10;&#10;Miss Reed, on the other hand, did not go to see her mother's body and burst out into loud weeping instead. The narrative suggests that she may have been feeling guilty or regretful about how she treated her mother or that she was overwhelmed by the situation. However, she did not cry either, which might indicate that she was trying to be strong or maintain her composure in front of Jane.&#10;&#10;The reason why they didn't cry is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it could be inferred that they were both struggling with conflicting emotions and memories of Mrs. Reed. Jane's reaction suggests that she felt a sense of relief rather than sadness, while Miss Reed might have been feeling guilty or regretful. The fact that neither of them cried could also suggest that they were trying to suppress their emotions or maintain their composure in front of each other." />

    <node id=" Eliza and Georgiana react differently to Jane's arrival, reflecting their distinct personalities and first impressions of her. Eliza's greeting is brief, abrupt, and expressionless, indicating her disinterest and lack of warmth towards Jane. In contrast, Georgiana extends a warmer welcome with commonplace remarks, but her side-glances and measured stare suggest she is sizing up Jane, assessing her appearance and social standing. This non-verbal communication conveys their initial impressions of Jane as plain and perhaps inferior to themselves." />
    <node id="ribable&#10;hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.&#10;&#10;Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by&#10;the name of &quot;Miss Eyre.&quot;  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,&#10;abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her&#10;eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her &quot;How&#10;d'ye do?&quot; several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,&#10;uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances&#10;that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab&#10;merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage&#10;bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they&#10;think you a &quot;quiz&quot; without actually saying the words.  A certain&#10;superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,&#10;express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or" />
    <node id=" In the narrative, when Jane Eyre suggests that Adele should go to school once Mr. Rochester gets married, he agrees to this plan. Mr. Rochester acknowledges that his bride might &quot;walk over her rather too emphatically&quot; if Adele stays at Thornfield Hall, implying that he sees the value in providing Adele with a separate education and living arrangement to ensure her well-being and to avoid any potential conflicts with his new wife. However, the narrative does not provide further details about the arrangements for Adele's education or the timeline for these plans." />
    <node id=" In the passage provided, it is mentioned that Mr. Reed, who was the husband of the narrator's aunt (Mrs. Reed), extracted a promise from her to take care of his sister's child (Jane Eyre) before he passed away. He bound his wife by vow to keep and raise Jane, despite Mrs. Reed's reservations and dislike for the child. This is mentioned in the excerpt when Mrs. Reed says, &quot;He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance... In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside... he bound me by vow to keep the creature.&quot;" />

It is as well I&#10;should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,&#10;burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?&#10;or is there no one in the room but you?&quot;&#10;&#10;I assured her we were alone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in&#10;breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own&#10;child; the other--&quot; she stopped.  &quot;After all, it is of no great&#10;importance, perhaps,&quot; she murmured to herself: &quot;and then I may get&#10;better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.&quot;&#10;&#10;She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;&#10;she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor," />

I hated&#10;it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!&#10;It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like&#10;any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used&#10;to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than&#10;he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children&#10;friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was&#10;angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he&#10;had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he&#10;died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been&#10;charged with a" />

But unimpressionable&#10;natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily&#10;eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather&#10;from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so&#10;icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was&#10;unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to&#10;tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me&#10;bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous&#10;pleasure: only a sense of mortification.&#10;&#10;I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to&#10;subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.&#10;My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their&#10;source.

    <node id=" The very tall and thin young lady with a sallow face, severe mien, and ascetic look, dressed in a straight-skirted black stuff dress and starched linen collar, wearing a string of ebony beads and a crucifix, is Eliza Reed. She is described as having little resemblance to her former self, except for her mother's Cairngorm eye. Based on this recollection, Eliza has become a severe and ascetic young woman, possibly in relation to religion given her plain dress and the crucifix she wears." />

This I felt sure was Eliza, though&#10;I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and&#10;colourless visage.&#10;&#10;The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I&#10;remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a&#10;full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular&#10;features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of&#10;her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her&#10;sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the&#10;other's looked puritanical.&#10;&#10;In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;&#10;the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the&#10;blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and&#10;chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable&#10;hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.&#10;&#10;Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me" />
    <node id=" Mr. Rochester offers Jane fifty pounds when he realizes she only has five shillings for her journey. This offer is significantly more than what she currently has, as it was quite a large sum of money during that time.&#10;&#10;Jane declines to accept more than what she is owed because she wants to be fair and not take advantage of Mr. Rochester's generosity. She believes accepting more than her due would make the gesture seem less genuine or businesslike, which may affect their professional relationship in the future. Jane's action reflects her honesty and integrity as well as her determination to maintain a sense of self-reliance." />
    <node id=" Bessie is describing to Jane Eyre the critical state of Mrs. Reed, who is Bessie's mistress at Gateshead Hall. Mrs. Reed has been asking for Jane and Bessie suggests that it may be because she wants to speak to Jane before she dies. Bessie also tells Jane that Mrs. Reed had been mumbling her name for some time before clearly saying, &quot;Bring Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.&quot; The young ladies of the house put off sending for Jane at first, but eventually consented due to their mother's restlessness and insistence on seeing Jane. Bessie has come to fetch Jane and bring her back to Gateshead Hall with her the next morning.&#10;&#10;Bessie's description of the situation allows Jane to reflect on her past feelings of outlawry and bitterness, which she experienced during her time at Gateshead Hall as a child. However, in contrast to those past feelings, Jane now has a stronger sense of self-trust and healing, which is evident in her more confident and mature demeanor." />
    <node id=" Upon returning to Gateshead Hall after nearly nine years, the narrator, Jane Eyre, is no longer the same girl who left with a &quot;desperate and embittered heart&quot; and a sense of &quot;outlawry and almost of reprobation.&quot; She has grown into a woman with &quot;firmer trust in herself and her own powers, and less withering dread of oppression.&quot; The wound of her wrongs has healed, and the flame of resentment has been extinguished.&#10;&#10;As she enters the breakfast room, Mrs. Reed, her former aunt, does not immediately recognize Jane due to the passage of time. When Jane reveals her identity, Mrs. Reed is surprised but accepts it, allowing Jane to explain her presence there. Jane's emotional response to revisiting her childhood home is not explicitly stated in the text, but her calm and gentle demeanor throughout the encounter suggests that she has come to terms with her past at Gateshead Hall.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre's return to Gateshead Hall is marked by a sense of maturity, self-assurance, and emotional resilience, which contrasts sharply with her initial departure characterized by bitterness and outlawry." />

I&#10;hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on&#10;the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post&#10;bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,&#10;and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to&#10;kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a&#10;certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once&#10;dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and&#10;lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened&#10;the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.&#10;&#10;Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar&#10;image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance&#10;and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in&#10;bitterness and hate, and I came back to" />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre shows surprising affection towards her aunt, Mrs. Reed, during their reunion because she has forgiven her for their past troubles and no longer harbors resentment or anger towards her. Despite the hardships that Mrs. Reed put her through, Jane has matured and grown emotionally since she last saw her aunt, and she approaches the encounter with a sense of calmness and self-assurance.&#10;&#10;Jane's newfound emotional resilience is evident in her gentle demeanor and measured responses throughout their conversation, as well as in her ability to listen attentively to Mrs. Reed's thoughts and feelings without becoming defensive or angry. This contrasts sharply with Jane's initial departure from Gateshead Hall, which was characterized by bitterness and outlawry.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's forgiveness of Mrs. Reed is likely motivated by her Christian beliefs, which emphasize the importance of compassion, mercy, and turning the other cheek. Throughout the novel, Jane has shown herself to be a deeply religious person, and she may view her reconciliation with Mrs. Reed as an opportunity to practice these virtues and make peace with her past.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's surprising display of affection towards Mrs. Reed reflects her emotional growth, maturity, and capacity for forgiveness, and it represents a significant turning point in their relationship, offering the possibility of closure and healing before Mrs. Reed's impending death." />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre kisses her Aunt Reed, who was once stern and despotic towards her, as a gesture of pity and compassion. This occurs at the end of the novel when Jane returns to Gateshead Hall after many years to see her aunt, who is now on her deathbed. Mrs. Reed recognizes Jane but does not immediately remember her, and Jane gently reminds her of their relationship.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed appears surprised but accepts Jane's presence, and Jane notes that her former aunt looks &quot;strangely altered.&quot; Despite their past differences and the harsh treatment Jane received at Gateshead Hall, Jane feels a sense of pity for Mrs. Reed in her final moments and kisses her on the forehead.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed's reaction to seeing Jane is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is mentioned that she looks &quot;strangely altered&quot; and does not initially recognize Jane. It is possible that she may have felt regretful or guilty about how she treated Jane in the past, as she asks Jane to forgive her before she dies. Overall, Jane's return to Gateshead Hall and her gesture of kissing Mrs. Reed signify her growth and maturity, as well as her ability to let go of past resentments and extend compassion to others." />
    <node id=" Based on Robert Leaven's account, Mr. John's death was due to a wild lifestyle and strange habits in the last three years of his life, which ended in a shocking manner. His death had a significant impact on Missis, who was already in poor health due to worry and fear of poverty caused by Mr. John's extravagance. The sudden news of her son's death and its manner led to a stroke, rendering her unable to speak for three days. Even after regaining consciousness, she repeatedly muttered Jane's name, leading Bessie to summon Jane Eyre to Gateshead." />

He got into debt and into&#10;jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he&#10;returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the&#10;knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came&#10;down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all&#10;to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his&#10;extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was&#10;dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--&#10;&#10;&quot;Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very&#10;stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of&#10;poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke" />
    <node id=" The very tall and thin young lady with a sallow face, severe mien, and ascetic look, dressed in a straight-skirted black stuff dress, starched linen collar, and nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix is Eliza Reed. She is related to the apartment's former appearance because she is standing in the same room where Jane Eyre first met Mr. Brocklehurst, and the furnishings have not changed since then. The narrator specifically notes that &quot;the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth,&quot; and she can even see the same books on the shelves. This indicates that the room has remained untouched for some time, providing a stark contrast to the altered appearance of Eliza Reed and her sister Georgiana." />
    <node id=" The narrative does not provide explicit details about Jane's reaction to Mrs. Reed's unchanged opinion of her. However, it can be inferred that Jane has forgiven Mrs. Reed for their past troubles and no longer harbors resentment or anger towards her, as evidenced by her calm and gentle demeanor throughout their encounter.&#10;&#10;Jane listens attentively to Mrs. Reed's thoughts and feelings without becoming defensive or angry, indicating a level of emotional resilience that she did not possess during her initial departure from Gateshead Hall.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's Christian beliefs may have influenced her decision to forgive Mrs. Reed and approach the encounter with compassion and mercy, as these virtues are emphasized in her religion.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the narrative does not provide explicit details about Jane's reaction to Mrs. Reed's unchanged opinion of her, it can be inferred that Jane has chosen to respond with forgiveness, compassion, and emotional resilience, reflecting her growth and maturity since their past troubles." />

Based on Georgiana's conversation during our walk in the grounds, she spent a brilliant winter in London two seasons ago and received much admiration and attention there. She also hinted at making a titled conquest during her time in London, suggesting that she had a successful and exciting social life in the city, attracting the interest of influential and high-ranking individuals." />
    <node id=" The news received about Mr. John is that he died in a shocking manner after living a wild and extravagant lifestyle for the past three years. He had ruined his health and estate, associating with bad company and getting into debt and jail. His death was sudden, and the cause of it is unclear, but there are rumors that he killed himself.&#10;&#10;Mr. John's mother, Missis, is dealing with his death by falling ill and having a stroke, which left her unable to speak for three days. Even after regaining consciousness, she repeatedly muttered Jane's name, leading Bessie to summon Jane Eyre to Gateshead. Missis had been in poor health due to worry and fear of poverty caused by Mr. John's extravagance, and the news of his death and its manner was too much for her to bear, causing her to have a severe reaction." />

Despite the hardships that Mrs. Reed put her through, Jane has matured and grown emotionally since she last saw her aunt, and she approaches the encounter with a sense of calmness and self-assurance.&#10;&#10;Jane's newfound emotional resilience is evident in her gentle demeanor and measured responses throughout their conversation, as well as in her ability to listen attentively to Mrs. Reed's thoughts and feelings without becoming defensive or angry. This contrasts sharply with Jane's initial departure from Gateshead Hall, which was characterized by bitterness and outlawry.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's forgiveness of Mrs. Reed is likely motivated by her Christian beliefs, which emphasize the importance of compassion, mercy, and turning the other cheek. Throughout the novel, Jane has shown herself to be a deeply religious person, and she may view her reconciliation with Mrs. Reed as an opportunity to practice these virtues and make peace with her past.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's surprising display of affection towards Mrs. Reed reflects her emotional growth, maturity, and capacity for forgiveness, and it represents a significant turning point in their relationship, offering the possibility of closure and healing before Mrs. Reed's impending death.">

This was triggered by Jane's connection to Jane's mother, who married a man below her social status, something that Mrs. Reed strongly disapproved of. Jane's presence and behavior served as constant reminders of this, leading Mrs. Reed to hold a grudge against her.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed's anger towards Jane was further exacerbated when she took revenge by falsely claiming that Jane had died of typhus fever at Lowood, as she could not endure the thought of Jane being adopted by Mr. Eyre and living in ease and comfort. This act of vengeance suggests that Mrs. Reed was unwilling to let go of her grudge against Jane and her family, further explaining her refusal to reconcile with Jane despite Jane's earnest desire for forgiveness and attempts at affection.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the power dynamic between them played a role in their strained relationship. As Jane's guardian, Mrs. Reed held a position of authority over her, which was reflected in her stern and relentless demeanor towards Jane. Jane's attempts to bridge the gap between them were likely seen as a challenge to Mrs. Reed's power and authority, further fueling her anger and resentment towards Jane.">

He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst" target=" The news received about Mr. John is that he died in a shocking manner after living a wild and extravagant lifestyle for the past three years. He had ruined his health and estate, associating with bad company and getting into debt and jail. His death was sudden, and the cause of it is unclear, but there are rumors that he killed himself.&#10;&#10;Mr. John's mother, Missis, is dealing with his death by falling ill and having a stroke, which left her unable to speak for three days. Even after regaining consciousness, she repeatedly muttered Jane's name, leading Bessie to summon Jane Eyre to Gateshead. Missis had been in poor health due to worry and fear of poverty caused by Mr. John's extravagance, and the news of his death and its manner was too much for her to bear, causing her to have a severe reaction.">

She seemed content with this routine, as any incident that forced her to vary its clockwork regularity annoyed her. Her apparent source of happiness was her self-sufficiency, punctual habits, and focus on personal tasks rather than seeking company or conversation. Additionally, she derived satisfaction from religious devotion, working on the altar cloth for a new church, and maintaining her accounts, indicating a sense of purpose and accomplishment in her daily life.">

She added the whiskers and waved hair to give the face a more masculine appearance.&#10;2. During a walk in the grounds with Georgiana, Jane learned about Georgiana's past through her conversation. Georgiana spent a brilliant winter in London two seasons ago and received much admiration and attention there. She also hinted at making a titled conquest during her time in London.

In the context of Anglican liturgy, the term 'rubric' refers to the directions given in red print indicating how the service should be conducted. This suggests that the woman places great importance on following established religious practices and rules.&#10;&#10;She is also working on a cloth covering for the altar of a new church near Gateshead.

There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,&#10;rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow&#10;and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange&#10;and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and&#10;pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or&#10;subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_&#10;loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a&#10;form.&#10;&#10;Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she&#10;observed--&#10;&#10;&quot;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life&#10;was shortened by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so" target=" Jane Eyre and Miss Reed (Mrs. Reed's daughter) did not cry after receiving the news about the death of Mrs. Reed, even though it was customary to shed tears during such occasions. The narrative suggests that their emotional state was more complex than simple sadness or grief.&#10;&#10;Jane describes her own reaction as one of &quot;gloom and pain&quot; but not for the loss of Mrs. Reed, whom she did not feel pity or hope towards. Instead, she felt a &quot;grating anguish for _her_ woes,&quot; suggesting that she felt sympathy for Mrs. Reed's suffering rather than sadness for her death. Jane's reaction is consistent with their strained relationship and the fact that Mrs. Reed had mistreated her in the past.&#10;&#10;Miss Reed, on the other hand, did not go to see her mother's body and burst out into loud weeping instead. The narrative suggests that she may have been feeling guilty or regretful about how she treated her mother or that she was overwhelmed by the situation. However, she did not cry either, which might indicate that she was trying to be strong or maintain her composure in front of Jane.&#10;&#10;The reason why they didn't cry is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it could be inferred that they were both struggling with conflicting emotions and memories of Mrs. Reed. Jane's reaction suggests that she felt a sense of relief rather than sadness, while Miss Reed might have been feeling guilty or regretful. The fact that neither of them cried could also suggest that they were trying to suppress their emotions or maintain their composure in front of each other.">

This was triggered by Jane's connection to Jane's mother, who married a man below her social status, something that Mrs. Reed strongly disapproved of. Jane's presence and behavior served as constant reminders of this, leading Mrs. Reed to hold a grudge against her.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed's anger towards Jane was further exacerbated when she took revenge by falsely claiming that Jane had died of typhus fever at Lowood, as she could not endure the thought of Jane being adopted by Mr. Eyre and living in ease and comfort. This act of vengeance suggests that Mrs. Reed was unwilling to let go of her grudge against Jane and her family, further explaining her refusal to reconcile with Jane despite Jane's earnest desire for forgiveness and attempts at affection.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the power dynamic between them played a role in their strained relationship. As Jane's guardian, Mrs. Reed held a position of authority over her, which was reflected in her stern and relentless demeanor towards Jane. Jane's attempts to bridge the gap between them were likely seen as a challenge to Mrs. Reed's power and authority, further fueling her anger and resentment towards Jane.">

This offer is significantly more than what she currently has, as it was quite a large sum of money during that time.&#10;&#10;Jane declines to accept more than what she is owed because she wants to be fair and not take advantage of Mr. Rochester's generosity. She believes accepting more than her due would make the gesture seem less genuine or businesslike, which may affect their professional relationship in the future. Jane's action reflects her honesty and integrity as well as her determination to maintain a sense of self-reliance.">

The narrative suggests that their emotional state was more complex than simple sadness or grief.&#10;&#10;Jane describes her own reaction as one of &quot;gloom and pain&quot; but not for the loss of Mrs. Reed, whom she did not feel pity or hope towards. Instead, she felt a &quot;grating anguish for _her_ woes,&quot; suggesting that she felt sympathy for Mrs. Reed's suffering rather than sadness for her death. Jane's reaction is consistent with their strained relationship and the fact that Mrs. Reed had mistreated her in the past.&#10;&#10;Miss Reed, on the other hand, did not go to see her mother's body and burst out into loud weeping instead. The narrative suggests that she may have been feeling guilty or regretful about how she treated her mother or that she was overwhelmed by the situation. However, she did not cry either, which might indicate that she was trying to be strong or maintain her composure in front of Jane.&#10;&#10;The reason why they didn't cry is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it could be inferred that they were both struggling with conflicting emotions and memories of Mrs. Reed. Jane's reaction suggests that she felt a sense of relief rather than sadness, while Miss Reed might have been feeling guilty or regretful. The fact that neither of them cried could also suggest that they were trying to suppress their emotions or maintain their composure in front of each other.">

Instead, she felt a &quot;grating anguish for _her_ woes,&quot; suggesting that she felt sympathy for Mrs. Reed's suffering rather than sadness for her death. Jane's reaction is consistent with their strained relationship and the fact that Mrs. Reed had mistreated her in the past.&#10;&#10;Miss Reed, on the other hand, did not go to see her mother's body and burst out into loud weeping instead.

However, she did not cry either, which might indicate that she was trying to be strong or maintain her composure in front of Jane.&#10;&#10;The reason why they didn't cry is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it could be inferred that they were both struggling with conflicting emotions and memories of Mrs. Reed. Jane's reaction suggests that she felt a sense of relief rather than sadness, while Miss Reed might have been feeling guilty or regretful. The fact that neither of them cried could also suggest that they were trying to suppress their emotions or maintain their composure in front of each other.">

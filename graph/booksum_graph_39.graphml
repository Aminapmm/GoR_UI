    <node id="The narrator, Mr. Rochester, had three mistresses: Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara. His relationship with Celine ended poorly, and he describes her as having been another &quot;step which make a man spurn himself.&quot; He found both Giacinta and Clara to be physically attractive but grew tired of them quickly due to their personalities; Giacinta was unprincipled and violent, while Clara was honest and quiet but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible. He ultimately paid Clara a sum of money to set her up in a good line of business so that he could part ways with her.&#10;&#10;Rochester's struggle to find fulfillment in these companionships can be inferred from his reflections on the matter. He notes that hiring a mistress is similar to buying a slave, as both are often inferior in nature and position. Living familiarly with inferiors, he believes, is degrading. Rochester's experiences with his mistresses have left him with feelings of regret and self-loathing. He recognizes that he cannot find true happiness through such relationships and longs for something more fulfilling.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rochester's failure in his relationships with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara can be attributed to their unsuitability as partners and the degrading nature of hiring a mistress. His struggle to find fulfillment in these companionships highlights his desire for something more meaningful and equal in a relationship." />
    <node id=" I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have&#10;asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried&#10;dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my&#10;Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me&#10;much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to&#10;approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.&#10;The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a&#10;man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,&#10;and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an&#10;Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly&#10;handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was&#10;unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three" />
    <node id=" I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the&#10;next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always&#10;by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is&#10;degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,&#10;Giacinta, and Clara.&quot;&#10;&#10;I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain&#10;inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching&#10;that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any&#10;justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these&#10;poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in&#10;his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this&#10;conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that&#10;it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.

Clara was&#10;honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to&#10;my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a&#10;good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see&#10;by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just&#10;now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it&#10;not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one&#10;mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of&#10;existence: I should never like to return to it.

Provided with plenty of money and the&#10;passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were&#10;closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,&#10;French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not&#10;find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,&#10;heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:&#10;but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired&#10;perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited&#10;me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them&#10;all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings" />
    <node id=" fear of his&#10;self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It&#10;was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract&#10;it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began&#10;singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds&#10;were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and&#10;frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from&#10;self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had&#10;injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I&#10;could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my&#10;own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled&#10;the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,&#10;fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,&#10;extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some" />

Jane--give it me now.&quot;&#10;&#10;A pause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why are you silent, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.&#10;Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being&#10;that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him&#10;who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and&#10;idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--&quot;Depart!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be&#10;yours, Mr. Rochester.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another long silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane!&quot; recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,&#10;and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was&#10;the pant of a lion rising--&quot;Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,&#10;and to let me go another" />
    <node id="The narrator, Jane Eyre, displays kindness towards Mr. Rochester throughout their chance meetings after she leaves Thornfield. This kindness plays a significant role in their relationship as it helps to ease the tension and hostility between them, allowing for more honest communication. Jane's kindness also enables her to forgive Mr. Rochester for his past deceit and express her love for him despite his 'curse.'&#10;&#10;Jane's kindness significantly impacts her emotions and reactions towards Mr. Rochester during their encounters. Her compassionate nature leads her to forgive Mr. Rochester, feel sympathy for his sufferings, and even comfort him in his time of need. This kindness creates a deep emotional bond between them, which ultimately helps Jane to make the decision to return to Mr. Rochester after learning about his misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Jane's kindness also influences her reactions towards Mr. Rochester's attempts at reconciliation. Despite her initial reservations and the pain he had caused her, Jane's kind heart allows her to listen to his apologies and express her love for him once again. This demonstrates that Jane's kindness not only affects her emotions but also influences her actions towards Mr. Rochester, ultimately leading to their reunion and a deeper understanding of each other's feelings." />
    <node id=", &quot;did you do when you had&#10;settled her here?  Where did you go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.&#10;Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the&#10;March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its&#10;lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent&#10;woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you could not marry, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not&#10;my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to&#10;tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me&#10;so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be&#10;loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to&#10;understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was&#10;burdened.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me" />

Will you ever forgive me?&quot;&#10;&#10;Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep&#10;remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his&#10;manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and&#10;mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my&#10;heart's core.&#10;&#10;&quot;You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?&quot; ere long he inquired&#10;wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,&#10;the result rather of weakness than of will.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot: I am tired and sick.

Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,&#10;became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but&#10;I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane! Jane!&quot; he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled&#10;along every nerve I had; &quot;you don't love me, then?  It was only my&#10;station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me&#10;disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I&#10;were some toad or ape.&quot;&#10;&#10;These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to&#10;have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at&#10;thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm&#10;where I had wounded.&#10;&#10;&quot;I _do_ love you,&quot; I said, &quot;more than ever: but I must not" />

But before I go on, tell me what you&#10;mean by your 'Well, sir?'

Then came a&#10;deep, strong sob.&#10;&#10;I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as&#10;determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face&#10;from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my&#10;hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;God bless you, my dear master!&quot; I said.  &quot;God keep you from harm and&#10;wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,&quot; he answered;&#10;&quot;without it," />

Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate&#10;exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast&#10;through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;&#10;but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and&#10;put his aside.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!--How is this?&quot; he exclaimed hastily.  &quot;Oh, I know! you won't kiss&#10;the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces&#10;appropriated?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer&#10;for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess&#10;rightly?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me;" />
    <node id="The quiet little figure sitting by herself on a stile in Hay Lane was Jane Eyre, who would later become the second wife of the narrator, Edward Rochester, and his moral guide." />
    <node id=" you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are&#10;looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to&#10;the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame&#10;of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with&#10;disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against&#10;all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,&#10;faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came&#10;back to England.&#10;&#10;&quot;On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.&#10;Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in&#10;Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as&#10;negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no&#10;presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the&#10;arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble&#10;guise.  I did not know it, even when" />
    <node id="arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble&#10;guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's&#10;accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender&#10;creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to&#10;bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it&#10;stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort&#10;of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.&#10;&#10;&quot;When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap&#10;and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf&#10;must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could&#10;not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind&#10;the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that&#10;night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or&#10;watched for you.  The next day I observed" />
    <node id=" still voice was&#10;the pant of a lion rising--&quot;Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,&#10;and to let me go another?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane&quot; (bending towards and embracing me), &quot;do you mean it now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And now?&quot; softly kissing my forehead and cheek.&#10;&#10;&quot;I do,&quot; extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked&#10;to love me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would to obey you.&quot;&#10;&#10;A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he&#10;forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I&#10;shook, I feared--but I resolved.&#10;&#10;&quot;One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are&#10;gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For&#10;a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some&#10;corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do," />
    <node id="though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more&#10;retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely&#10;enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in&#10;the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.&#10;Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to&#10;each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect&#10;assassination, even of what I most hate.&#10;&#10;&quot;Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was&#10;something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a&#10;upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll&#10;shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower&#10;windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my&#10;wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and&#10;she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her&#10;company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms," />
    <node id=" come home that&#10;night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or&#10;watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-&#10;hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I&#10;recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door&#10;was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward&#10;attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but&#10;you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and&#10;amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once&#10;into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now&#10;and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling&#10;snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and&#10;dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a&#10;pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in&#10;your aspect, which told of no bitter," />
    <node id=" only latched.  Through that I&#10;departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.&#10;&#10;A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary&#10;direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,&#10;and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to&#10;be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.&#10;Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The&#10;first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line&#10;of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was&#10;an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.&#10;&#10;I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it&#10;was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I&#10;left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising&#10;sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass&#10;through a fair scene" />
    <node id="Yes, Mr. Rochester does express deep remorse for his past deceit and mistreatment of Jane. This is evident when he confesses the truth about his first marriage and pleads with Jane to stay with him, promising to make things right. He also acknowledges the pain he caused her and begs her to reconsider her decision to leave him.&#10;&#10;Jane's forgiveness for Mr. Rochester is demonstrated through her kind actions towards him, such as comforting him in his time of need and praying for his well-being. However, she still stands firm on her decision to leave Thornfield due to the social and moral implications of their relationship.&#10;&#10;In response to Mr. Rochester's question about whether Jane thinks him a scoundrel, she is unable to affirm it because of her weakened state. This suggests that while Jane recognizes the gravity of Mr. Rochester's past actions, she also acknowledges his remorse and is unwilling to judge him harshly in his current state of despair." />
    <node id=" me!&quot; burst involuntarily from my lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a fool!&quot; cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  &quot;I keep telling her I am&#10;not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing&#10;of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my&#10;infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in&#10;opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,&#10;Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove&#10;you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the&#10;case.  Can you listen to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; for hours if you will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the&#10;eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have understood something to that effect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane," />
    <node id="a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some&#10;corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a&#10;companion and for some hope?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet&#10;again there.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you will not yield?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?&quot;  His voice&#10;rose.&#10;&#10;&quot;I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust&#10;for a passion--vice for an occupation?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for&#10;myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You&#10;will forget me before I forget you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I&#10;could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a&#10;" />
    <node id="Jane realizes that becoming Mr. Rochester's mistress would lead to being regarded with the same disdain as his previous mistresses during their conversation when he pleads with her to stay with him. Although she initially struggles with how to respond, she eventually gathers the strength to reject his proposal and uphold her moral principles.&#10;&#10;Jane chooses not to voice her conviction that becoming Mr. Rochester's mistress would lead to disdain because she understands that he is in a vulnerable and desperate state of mind. She does not want to further hurt him by explicitly stating the social consequences of their actions, as it may only serve to deepen his despair.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's kind and compassionate nature also plays a role in her decision to keep her conviction in her heart. By withholding judgment and showing empathy towards Mr. Rochester, she is able to maintain a sense of respect and dignity for both herself and him. This approach ultimately allows for a more honest and open dialogue between them, as Jane's kindness creates a safe space for Mr. Rochester to express his remorse and beg for forgiveness." />
    <node id="Jane is refusing Mr. Rochester's request for her to promise to be his because she understands that their relationship would be morally and socially unacceptable, leading to disdain and judgment from others. Although she loves him deeply, she chooses to uphold her moral principles and maintain her self-respect by rejecting his proposal to become his mistress. Jane's kind and compassionate nature also plays a role in her decision not to voice her conviction explicitly, as she does not want to further hurt Mr. Rochester or damage their relationship. Instead, she demonstrates her love and respect for him through her comforting actions and kind words." />
    <node id="The speaker, Mr. Rochester, did not take the news of Jane's perceived &quot;madness&quot; (her being an orphan with a small fortune) well and approached the verge of despair due to the social implications of their relationship. This is because, in the eyes of society, he would be seen as dishonorable for marrying someone of lower class and social status.&#10;&#10;His emotional state at the time was vastly different from the &quot;hybrid, egotistical&quot; pity he describes earlier in the text. The pity he feels for Jane is genuine, full of love, and maternal in nature. It comes from a place of compassion and understanding rather than contempt or superiority. This is evident when he says, &quot;Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion.&quot;&#10;&#10;In contrast, the &quot;hybrid, egotistical&quot; pity he describes earlier is a shallow and self-serving emotion, born out of ignorance and contempt for those who have suffered. The person who feels this type of pity sees themselves as superior to the person they are pitying and uses it as a way to distance themselves emotionally. Mr. Rochester's feelings for Jane, however, bring him closer to her and lead to a deeper emotional connection." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,&#10;which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer&#10;it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is&#10;a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant&#10;contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,&#10;Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this&#10;moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your&#10;heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.

The narrator describes her as a &quot;linnet,&quot; a small bird, who proposed to aid him in his time of need.

Later, he realizes that this figure is connected to his house down below, referring to Jane's significance in his life." />

In the eyes of the world, I&#10;was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in&#10;my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her&#10;crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.&#10;Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and&#10;heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I&#10;breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that&#10;recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,&#10;I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and&#10;better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father&#10;had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live&#10;as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.

    <node id="Based on Jane's reactions and reflections during her conversation with Mr. Rochester, it is clear that she does not approve of hiring a mistress. She sees it as a morally and socially unacceptable practice, similar to buying a slave. This view is evident when Mr. Rochester brings up the subject, and Jane becomes visibly uncomfortable and critical of his past actions.&#10;&#10;Jane's kind and compassionate nature also plays a role in her decision not to explicitly voice her disapproval to Mr. Rochester. She understands that he is vulnerable and desperate, and does not want to further hurt him by criticizing his past behavior. Instead, she shows empathy towards him and maintains a sense of respect and dignity for both herself and Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's own experiences with Mr. Rochester's previous mistresses have shown her the negative consequences of such relationships. She sees how they were treated with disdain and judgment by society, and does not want to be subjected to the same treatment herself. Therefore, she chooses to uphold her moral principles and reject Mr. Rochester's proposal to become his mistress, despite her deep love for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's thoughts on hiring a mistress are negative, as she sees it as an immoral and dehumanizing practice. She demonstrates her disapproval through her kind and compassionate actions towards Mr. Rochester, while still maintaining her self-respect and upholding her moral principles." />

    <node id="Jane Eyre has decided not to accept Mr. Rochester's proposal to become his mistress, as she believes it would be morally and socially unacceptable, leading to disdain and judgment from others. Although she loves him deeply, she chooses to uphold her moral principles and maintain her self-respect by rejecting his proposal, demonstrating her kind and compassionate nature towards him. Jane's kind and forgiving character plays a significant role in their relationship, allowing for honest communication and emotional bonding between them, which ultimately helps Jane make this decision to maintain her integrity while dealing with her conflicted feelings towards Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id="The speaker, Edward Rochester, perceives that the addressee, Jane Eyre, does not accuse or revile him as he expected. Despite Jane's weak physical state, she is thinking of how to act rather than talking, which he interprets as a sign that she wants to avoid making a scene. He infers that Jane believes it would be futile to upbraid or expostulate with him and realizes she knows him well enough to anticipate his guarded response.&#10;&#10;Rochester also notices that Jane seems eager for answers, which prompts him to inquire about her meaning when she says &quot;Well, sir?&quot; He eventually understands that she wants to know if he found someone he liked and whether he proposed to her, but Jane remains silent about the woman's response. Based on this narrative, it appears that Rochester perceives Jane as a direct, thoughtful, and compassionate individual who seeks honesty above all else." />

    <node id="The narrator, Mr. Rochester, experienced various painful and inescapable consequences as a result of being married to Bertha Mason. These include:&#10;&#10;1. Social ostracism and loss of reputation: Being married to a woman who led an intemperate and unchaste life brought shame and social exclusion upon Rochester.&#10;&#10;2. Legal complications: Despite discovering that Bertha was mad, Rochester could not rid himself of the marriage through legal proceedings due to her mental state.&#10;&#10;3. Unsettled household: Bertha's violent and unreasonable temper, as well as her contradictory and exacting orders, made it difficult for Rochester to maintain a quiet or settled household, as no servant would bear with her continued outbreaks.&#10;&#10;4. Inability to form meaningful relationships: Due to his marriage to Bertha, Rochester struggled to find fulfillment in companionships, recognizing that he could not find true happiness through such relationships. His experiences left him with feelings of regret and self-loathing.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional distress and trauma: Living with Bertha for four years and witnessing her vices develop rapidly took a significant emotional toll on Rochester, causing fearful curses and agonies that he had to endure." />

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, there is no explicit information about Mr. Rochester's plans to ensure Bertha Mason's confinement and Jane's safety after their marriage. However, it can be inferred that he had previously taken some measures to keep Bertha under control, such as keeping her locked up in a room at Thornfield Hall. Nevertheless, this situation caused him significant emotional distress and legal complications, which might have prompted him to consider other solutions.&#10;&#10;In the given text, Mr. Rochester is not focused on discussing his plans for Bertha Mason's confinement but rather on pleading with Jane to stay with him and expressing his remorse for his past deceit and mistreatment.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Jane Eyre believes that in order to avoid constant emotional struggles and conflicts with her employer, Mr. Rochester, she cannot become his mistress. This is because such a relationship would be morally and socially unacceptable, leading to disdain and judgment from others. Although Jane loves him deeply, she chooses to uphold her moral principles and maintain her self-respect by rejecting his proposal.&#10;&#10;Jane's kind and compassionate nature also plays a role in her decision not to voice her conviction explicitly, as she does not want to further hurt Mr. Rochester or damage their relationship. Instead, she demonstrates her love and respect for him through her comforting actions and kind words.&#10;&#10;Therefore, for Jane to avoid emotional struggles and conflicts with Mr. Rochester, a significant change in their circumstances would be necessary. Specifically, Mr. Rochester would need to become free from his marriage to Bertha Mason or enter into a socially acceptable relationship with Jane. Until then, Jane is committed to upholding her moral principles and maintaining her self-respect, even if it means refusing Mr. Rochester's proposal and risking their relationship." />
    <node id="After leaving Mr. Rochester, Jane experiences a range of emotions including sadness, confusion, and possibly regret. She is physically weak but mentally preoccupied with her situation, demonstrating her thoughtful and compassionate nature by refraining from accusing or reproaching him. Despite the pain he caused her, she remains kind towards him, showing her forgiving personality.&#10;&#10;Jane's emotions are heavily influenced by the memories of their encounters, especially Mr. Rochester's attempts at reconciliation and his genuine feelings of pity and love for her. The depth of these emotions creates a deep emotional bond between them, making it difficult for Jane to completely sever ties with him.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Jane is likely experiencing anxiety about her future as an independent woman with a small fortune but without familial support or guidance. This sense of isolation may be overwhelming, contributing to her weakened state. However, she remains resolute in her decision to leave Thornfield due to the social and moral implications of their relationship, demonstrating her strong moral compass and personal integrity." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide explicit information about the route Jane Eyre took when she left Thornfield Hall with Mr. Rochester. It is mentioned that they both left Thornfield Hall, but their destination remains uncertain within the context provided.&#10;&#10;As for Jane's state of mind, she was physically weak and preoccupied with her situation after making the decision to leave Mr. Rochester. She experienced a range of emotions including sadness, confusion, and possibly regret. Despite this, Jane remained kind towards Mr. Rochester, refraining from accusing or reproaching him for his past deceit.&#10;&#10;Jane's thoughts were heavily influenced by memories of their encounters and Mr. Rochester's attempts at reconciliation. Her emotions created an emotional bond between them, making it difficult for Jane to completely sever ties with him. However, she still stood firm on her decision to leave Thornfield due to the social and moral implications of their relationship, demonstrating her strong moral compass and personal integrity.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane's state of mind during this time prevented her from reflecting on the past or looking towards the future as she was preoccupied with processing her emotions and making sense of her situation." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, even though Jane recognizes the potential harm that living with Mr. Rochester as his mistress could cause him, she is still determined to uphold her initial decision to reject his proposal. This is because becoming his mistress would be morally and socially unacceptable, leading to disdain and judgment from others. Jane values her moral principles and self-respect above her desire to be with Mr. Rochester, and she does not want to compromise these values even if it means risking their relationship.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Jane's kind and compassionate nature also plays a role in her decision not to voice her conviction explicitly, as she does not want to further hurt Mr. Rochester or damage their relationship. Instead, she demonstrates her love and respect for him through her comforting actions and kind words.&#10;&#10;Therefore, even though Jane understands the potential harm that living with Mr. Rochester as his mistress could cause him, she is still determined to uphold her initial decision due to her commitment to her moral principles and self-respect, as well as her desire to maintain a sense of kindness and compassion towards Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id="The narrator, Jane Eyre, displays kindness towards Mr. Rochester throughout their chance meetings after she leaves Thornfield. This kindness plays a significant role in affecting Jane's mood and emotions during their encounters by helping to ease the tension and hostility between them, allowing for more honest communication. Jane's compassionate nature leads her to forgive Mr. Rochester, feel sympathy for his sufferings, and even comfort him in his time of need. This kindness creates a deep emotional bond between them, which ultimately helps Jane make the decision to return to Mr. Rochester after learning about his misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Jane's kind and compassionate nature also influences her reactions towards Mr. Rochester's attempts at reconciliation. Despite her initial reservations and the pain he had caused her, Jane's kind heart allows her to listen to his apologies and express her love for him once again. This demonstrates that Jane's kindness not only affects her emotions but also influences her actions towards Mr. Rochester, ultimately leading to their reunion and a deeper understanding of each other's feelings.&#10;&#10;Therefore, during their chance meetings in the schoolroom, Jane's kindness plays a crucial role in shaping her mood and emotions by enabling her to forgive Mr. Rochester, feel empathy for his sufferings, and maintain an emotional bond with him despite the challenges they face." />

As she walked amongst the drenched pomegranates and pineapples, she saw birds that were faithful to their mates, which made her abhor herself even more for leaving Mr. Rochester. However, she also felt a strong impulse to return to him, as she could not help thinking of his suffering without her.&#10;&#10;Despite this temptation, Jane heard a voice in her head telling her to flee temptation and realized that it was her mother's spirit consoling her with true wisdom.

He who is taken out to pass&#10;through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that&#10;smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of&#10;bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear&#10;flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I&#10;left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching&#10;the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and&#10;be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I&#10;could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I&#10;was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his&#10;pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his&#10;self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!

I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;&#10;as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke&#10;forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the&#10;sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form&#10;shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and&#10;gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,&#10;yet so near, it whispered in my heart--&#10;&#10;&quot;My daughter, flee temptation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mother, I will.&quot;&#10;&#10;So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.

Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and&#10;opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no&#10;refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly&#10;round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull&#10;like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was&#10;setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw&#10;her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of&#10;tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my&#10;ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein&#10;she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such&#10;language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:&#10;though" />

I thought of&#10;this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided&#10;on.&#10;&#10;Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it&#10;mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I&#10;sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.&#10;I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk&#10;far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All&#10;this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it&#10;softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and&#10;locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I&#10;departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.&#10;&#10;A mile" />
    <node id="Based on the given narrative, the protagonist, Jane Eyre, decided to leave Thornfield Hall with Mr. Rochester due to its haunted nature after placing the lunatic (Bertha Mason) in the Red Room. The text suggests that she did so early in the morning and quietly to avoid making a sound. However, it does not provide explicit details about the steps Jane took to leave Thornfield.&#10;&#10;We can infer that Jane might have packed her belongings silently, ensuring that nothing would make noise and alert Mr. Rochester or any servants. She may have also chosen a time when most people were still asleep, making it easier for her to slip away unnoticed.&#10;&#10;Jane thought it was necessary to leave Thornfield quietly because she wanted to avoid any confrontations or lengthy discussions with Mr. Rochester, who had been trying to persuade her to stay. By leaving early in the morning without making a sound, Jane could minimize the risk of being discovered and maintain control over her decision to leave. This action demonstrates her firmness in sticking to her decisions despite challenges and emotional turmoil." />
    <node id="The narrator, Jane Eyre, is unable to enter Mr. Rochester's chamber and reveal her love for him primarily due to their different social statuses at the time. Jane is aware that she is a governess and of lower social standing than Mr. Rochester, who is a wealthy gentleman. She believes it would be inappropriate and socially unacceptable for her to enter his room, especially during the night, as this could lead to gossip, damage her reputation, and put her position at Thornfield Hall at risk.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Jane's kind and compassionate nature is evident throughout the narrative, and she would not want to do anything that might further hurt or confuse Mr. Rochester, especially since he is in a state of distress due to his restlessness and impatiently waiting for daybreak. By maintaining her distance and adhering to societal norms, Jane demonstrates respect for Mr. Rochester's feelings and situation while also protecting herself from potential consequences that could arise from such an action." />
    <node id="After Jane Eyre was seized by a weakness and fell to the ground, she crawled forward on her hands and knees and eventually managed to stand up. She was eager to reach the road and flagged down a passing coach, asking the driver to take her to a place far away where Mr. Rochester had no connections. When the driver quoted a price of thirty shillings, Jane offered twenty, which he agreed to accept. She was then allowed to ride inside the empty vehicle, and it set off on its journey. This shows that despite her weak physical state, Jane was determined to leave Thornfield Hall and secure transportation to a new location." />
    <node id=" delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,&#10;extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some&#10;minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that&#10;here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and&#10;knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as&#10;ever to reach the road.&#10;&#10;When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and&#10;while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and&#10;lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named&#10;a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no&#10;connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty&#10;shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.&#10;He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was&#10;empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.&#10;&#10;Gentle reader" />
    <node id=" that,&#10;long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I&#10;was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at&#10;the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  &quot;Friends always forget&#10;those whom fortune forsakes,&quot; I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed&#10;out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was&#10;dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,&#10;but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I&#10;was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber&#10;threshold.&#10;&#10;&quot;You come out at last,&quot; he said.  &quot;Well, I have been waiting for you&#10;long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five&#10;minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock&#10;like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!&#10;I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehem" />
    <node id="Bertha Mason's character was described as having a &quot;coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile&quot; nature, with her vices developing rapidly. She exhibited violent and unreasonable temper, leading to constant outbreaks that made it difficult for the speaker (Mr. Rochester) to maintain a quiet or settled household. Her exacting orders were contradictory and vexatious, causing strain on their relationship and making it impossible for any servant to bear with her continued behavior.&#10;&#10;Living with Bertha for four years had significant consequences for Mr. Rochester's life, both emotionally and socially. He experienced deep antipathy towards her, but refrained from using cruelty to control her behavior. As a result of her intemperate and unchaste character, he faced legal complications when the doctors declared her mad due to her prematurely developed insanity caused by her excesses. This prevented him from legally separating from her despite his wealth.&#10;&#10;Emotionally, Mr. Rochester endured &quot;hideous and degrading agonies&quot; during their time together, which led to feelings of regret and self-loathing. He also experienced fearful curses and agonies as a result of Bertha's vices, further impacting his life negatively." />
    <node id="In the narrative, the critical situation that Jane faces with Mr. Rochester (who is figuratively referred to as Samson) is his desperate plea for her to stay with him after confessing his past deceit and mistreatment. He becomes emotionally overwhelmed and threatens to use violence if she doesn't comply with his wishes.&#10;&#10;Jane manages to control the situation by displaying an &quot;inward power&quot; and a sense of influence, which helps her remain calm and composed. She seizes the present moment to take action, knowing that any movement of repulsion or fear would only worsen the situation. By taking hold of his clenched hand and loosening the contorted fingers, Jane demonstrates her courage and determination to manage the crisis. This act also signifies her empathetic connection with Mr. Rochester, as she tries to reach out to him in his moment of despair.&#10;&#10;Jane's kind and compassionate nature plays a significant role in this situation, as it allows her to remain calm and maintain her moral principles while dealing with the conflicted feelings she has towards Mr. Rochester. Her forgiving personality enables her to see past his threats and focus on the genuine remorse he expresses for his past actions.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's inner power and influence, grounded in her kind and compassionate character, help her control the critical situation with Mr. Rochester and maintain her personal integrity." />

I saw that in another moment, and&#10;with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.&#10;The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to&#10;control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would&#10;have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I&#10;felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The&#10;crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,&#10;perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of&#10;his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said" />
    <node id="The character, Jane Eyre, demonstrates a strong commitment to upholding her moral principles and values, even in moments of temptation or personal struggle. This is evident when she rejects Mr. Rochester's proposal to become his mistress, despite her deep love for him. Jane recognizes that such a relationship would be morally and socially unacceptable, leading to disdain and judgment from others. She values her self-respect and moral principles above her desire to be with Mr. Rochester and does not want to compromise these values, even at the risk of damaging their relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's kind and compassionate nature plays a role in her decision not to voice her conviction explicitly, as she does not want to further hurt Mr. Rochester or damage their relationship. Instead, she demonstrates her love and respect for him through her comforting actions and kind words.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Jane Eyre's stance on upholding laws and principles is one of unwavering commitment, even in the face of personal struggles and temptations. Her strong moral character guides her decisions and actions, enabling her to maintain her integrity while also demonstrating kindness and compassion towards others." />
    <node id="Jane Eyre does not spend another night at Thornfield Hall before leaving because the narrative never explicitly states that she does. However, if we interpret the question as asking why Jane decides not to accept Mr. Rochester's proposal to become his mistress and leave Thornfield immediately, it is due to her strong moral compass and personal integrity.&#10;&#10;Jane believes that accepting such a proposal would be morally and socially unacceptable, leading to disdain and judgment from others. Although she loves him deeply, she chooses to uphold her moral principles and maintain her self-respect by rejecting his proposal. This decision showcases Jane's kind and compassionate nature towards Mr. Rochester, allowing for honest communication and emotional bonding between them.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the speaker in this context refers to Mr. Rochester, who offers Jane lifelong care and affection through an intimate relationship outside of marriage. However, Jane's moral beliefs do not allow her to accept this offer, as she values equality and respect in relationships, which are principles that such an arrangement would violate." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Mr. Rochester does not explicitly say that he considers himself a scoundrel, but he does express deep remorse for his past deceit and mistreatment of Jane. When Jane is unable to affirm that she thinks him a scoundrel due to her weakened state, this suggests that while she recognizes the gravity of his actions, she also acknowledges his remorse and is unwilling to judge him harshly in his current state of despair. Mr. Rochester's emotional state has shifted from a &quot;hybrid, egotistical&quot; pity to a more genuine and compassionate love for Jane, which indicates his desire to change and make amends for his mistakes." />
    <edge source="The narrator, Mr. Rochester, had three mistresses: Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara. His relationship with Celine ended poorly, and he describes her as having been another &quot;step which make a man spurn himself.&quot; He found both Giacinta and Clara to be physically attractive but grew tired of them quickly due to their personalities; Giacinta was unprincipled and violent, while Clara was honest and quiet but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible. He ultimately paid Clara a sum of money to set her up in a good line of business so that he could part ways with her.&#10;&#10;Rochester's struggle to find fulfillment in these companionships can be inferred from his reflections on the matter. He notes that hiring a mistress is similar to buying a slave, as both are often inferior in nature and position. Living familiarly with inferiors, he believes, is degrading. Rochester's experiences with his mistresses have left him with feelings of regret and self-loathing. He recognizes that he cannot find true happiness through such relationships and longs for something more fulfilling.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rochester's failure in his relationships with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara can be attributed to their unsuitability as partners and the degrading nature of hiring a mistress. His struggle to find fulfillment in these companionships highlights his desire for something more meaningful and equal in a relationship." target=" I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of&#10;the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have&#10;asked to marry me.

Rochester's experiences with his mistresses have left him with feelings of regret and self-loathing. He recognizes that he cannot find true happiness through such relationships and longs for something more fulfilling.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rochester's failure in his relationships with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara can be attributed to their unsuitability as partners and the degrading nature of hiring a mistress. His struggle to find fulfillment in these companionships highlights his desire for something more meaningful and equal in a relationship." target="The narrator, Mr. Rochester, experienced various painful and inescapable consequences as a result of being married to Bertha Mason. These include:&#10;&#10;1. Social ostracism and loss of reputation: Being married to a woman who led an intemperate and unchaste life brought shame and social exclusion upon Rochester.&#10;&#10;2. Legal complications: Despite discovering that Bertha was mad, Rochester could not rid himself of the marriage through legal proceedings due to her mental state.&#10;&#10;3. Unsettled household: Bertha's violent and unreasonable temper, as well as her contradictory and exacting orders, made it difficult for Rochester to maintain a quiet or settled household, as no servant would bear with her continued outbreaks.&#10;&#10;4. Inability to form meaningful relationships: Due to his marriage to Bertha, Rochester struggled to find fulfillment in companionships, recognizing that he could not find true happiness through such relationships. His experiences left him with feelings of regret and self-loathing.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional distress and trauma: Living with Bertha for four years and witnessing her vices develop rapidly took a significant emotional toll on Rochester, causing fearful curses and agonies that he had to endure.">

Clara was&#10;honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to&#10;my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a&#10;good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see&#10;by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just&#10;now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.

You talk of it as a mere matter of course.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of&#10;existence: I should never like to return to it.

She sees it as a morally and socially unacceptable practice, similar to buying a slave. This view is evident when Mr. Rochester brings up the subject, and Jane becomes visibly uncomfortable and critical of his past actions.&#10;&#10;Jane's kind and compassionate nature also plays a role in her decision not to explicitly voice her disapproval to Mr. Rochester. She understands that he is vulnerable and desperate, and does not want to further hurt him by criticizing his past behavior. Instead, she shows empathy towards him and maintains a sense of respect and dignity for both herself and Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's own experiences with Mr. Rochester's previous mistresses have shown her the negative consequences of such relationships. She sees how they were treated with disdain and judgment by society, and does not want to be subjected to the same treatment herself. Therefore, she chooses to uphold her moral principles and reject Mr. Rochester's proposal to become his mistress, despite her deep love for him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's thoughts on hiring a mistress are negative, as she sees it as an immoral and dehumanizing practice. She demonstrates her disapproval through her kind and compassionate actions towards Mr. Rochester, while still maintaining her self-respect and upholding her moral principles.">

However, she also felt a strong impulse to return to him, as she could not help thinking of his suffering without her.&#10;&#10;Despite this temptation, Jane heard a voice in her head telling her to flee temptation and realized that it was her mother's spirit consoling her with true wisdom.

He experienced deep antipathy towards her, but refrained from using cruelty to control her behavior.

This prevented him from legally separating from her despite his wealth.&#10;&#10;Emotionally, Mr. Rochester endured &quot;hideous and degrading agonies&quot; during their time together, which led to feelings of regret and self-loathing.

By maintaining her distance and adhering to societal norms, Jane demonstrates respect for Mr. Rochester's feelings and situation while also protecting herself from potential consequences that could arise from such an action.">

He&#10;would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his&#10;love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of&#10;this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided&#10;on.&#10;&#10;Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it&#10;mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I&#10;sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.&#10;I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk&#10;far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All&#10;this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it&#10;softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and&#10;locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I&#10;departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.&#10;&#10;A mile">

    <node id="The never-ending source of conflict between the English and French, as described in the narrative, is a cycle of pride, violence, and desire for revenge that has lasted for centuries. This is exemplified by the battle referred to as &quot;in every Englishman's mouth,&quot; where English and French soldiers engage in fierce combat, with the English infantry repelling the charges of French horsemen throughout the day. The French side suffers heavy casualties, and their attack eventually weakens. When the French Imperial Guard launches a final assault, they are met with resolute resistance from the English troops, who break through the Guard's formation and cause them to retreat.&#10;&#10;This long-standing conflict is fueled by the desire for glory and honor, as well as the bitter taste of past defeats. The narrative highlights how this hatred and rage can be passed down through generations, creating a cycle where Frenchmen and Englishmen &quot;might be boasting and killing each other still.&quot;&#10;&#10;The passage also touches upon the impact of war on civilians, describing the alarm and panic in Brussels as people await news from the battlefield. The description of women rushing to churches and praying for the safety of their loved ones underscores the widespread fear and anxiety that accompanies war.&#10;&#10;In summary, the never-ending source of conflict between the English and French is a deeply ingrained cycle of violence, revenge, and desire for glory, which has resulted in centuries of fighting and animosity between the two nations." />
    <node id="  The tale is&#10;in every Englishman's mouth; and you and I, who were children when the&#10;great battle was won and lost, are never tired of hearing and&#10;recounting the history of that famous action.  Its remembrance rankles&#10;still in the bosoms of millions of the countrymen of those brave men&#10;who lost the day.  They pant for an opportunity of revenging that&#10;humiliation; and if a contest, ending in a victory on their part,&#10;should ensue, elating them in their turn, and leaving its cursed legacy&#10;of hatred and rage behind to us, there is no end to the so-called glory&#10;and shame, and to the alternations of successful and unsuccessful&#10;murder, in which two high-spirited nations might engage.  Centuries&#10;hence, we Frenchmen and Englishmen might be boasting and killing each&#10;other still, carrying out bravely the Devil's code of honour.&#10;&#10;All our friends took their share and fought like men in the great&#10;field.  All day long, whilst the women were praying ten miles away, the&#10;lines of the dauntless English infantry were receiving and repelling&#10;the furious charges of the French horsemen." />
    <node id=" women were praying ten miles away, the&#10;lines of the dauntless English infantry were receiving and repelling&#10;the furious charges of the French horsemen.  Guns which were heard at&#10;Brussels were ploughing up their ranks, and comrades falling, and the&#10;resolute survivors closing in.  Towards evening, the attack of the&#10;French, repeated and resisted so bravely, slackened in its fury.  They&#10;had other foes besides the British to engage, or were preparing for a&#10;final onset.  It came at last:  the columns of the Imperial Guard&#10;marched up the hill of Saint Jean, at length and at once to sweep the&#10;English from the height which they had maintained all day, and spite of&#10;all:  unscared by the thunder of the artillery, which hurled death from&#10;the English line--the dark rolling column pressed on and up the hill.&#10;It seemed almost to crest the eminence, when it began to wave and&#10;falter.  Then it stopped, still facing the shot.  Then at last the&#10;English troops rushed from the post from which no enemy had been able&#10;to dislodge them, and the Guard turned and fled.&#10;&#10;No more firing was heard" />

Crowds rushed to the Namur gate, from which direction the&#10;noise proceeded, and many rode along the level chaussee, to be in&#10;advance of any intelligence from the army.  Each man asked his&#10;neighbour for news; and even great English lords and ladies&#10;condescended to speak to persons whom they did not know.  The friends&#10;of the French went abroad, wild with excitement, and prophesying the&#10;triumph of their Emperor.  The merchants closed their shops, and came&#10;out to swell the general chorus of alarm and clamour.  Women rushed to&#10;the churches, and crowded the chapels, and knelt and prayed on the&#10;flags and steps.  The dull sound of the cannon went on rolling,&#10;rolling.

During the&#10;time of these battles and dangers, old Miss Crawley was living at&#10;Brighton, very moderately moved by the great events that were going on.&#10;The great events rendered the newspapers rather interesting, to be&#10;sure, and Briggs read out the Gazette, in which Rawdon Crawley's&#10;gallantry was mentioned with honour, and" />

Anybody who will take the trouble of looking back to a file of&#10;the newspapers of the time, must, even now, feel at second-hand this&#10;breathless pause of expectation.

    <node id="Rebecca Sharp, now Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, was living a thrilling social life in Paris during the famous winter, finding herself at the center of attention for many notable figures from various nationalities. The European congress on her reception night was attended by Prussians, Cossacks, Spanish, and English personalities, turning her humble saloon into a place of envy. Famous warriors rode by her carriage in the Bois or crowded her modest little box at the Opera (Thackeray 374).&#10;&#10;Despite being snubbed by some female acquaintances from her past and experiencing cold treatment from British high society, Becky remained unperturbed. She went regularly to church with Rawdon, who was feeling the sting of these social slights more acutely. However, Becky's good-natured influence kept him in check, reminding him that she had been a governess and he had a poor reputation for debt and gambling (Thackeray 375).&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Mrs. Rawdon Crawley began to have hopes that her rich aunt, Miss Crawley, would reconcile with her. This was after receiving a gracious reply from the spinster, who even encouraged Rawdon's correspondence. Becky and Rawdon seized this opportunity, sending their aunt delightful letters from Paris, where they had been fortunate enough to accompany the conquering army (Thackeray 376).&#10;&#10;However, Miss Crawley's communications were less gracious towards the rector's lady, Mrs. Bute Crawley, who had committed the grave error of boring the wealthy spinster during her stay at Miss Crawley's home. This lapse in judgment resulted in unfavorable treatment from the formidable Miss Crawley." />

How she loves you! how we all love our&#10;admirable, our respectable Miss Crawley!&quot;&#10;&#10;It is to be feared that this letter of the Parisian great lady did not&#10;by any means advance Mrs. Becky's interest with her admirable, her&#10;respectable, relative.  On the contrary, the fury of the old spinster&#10;was beyond bounds, when she found what was Rebecca's situation, and how&#10;audaciously she had made use of Miss Crawley's name, to get an entree&#10;into Parisian society.  Too much shaken in mind and body to compose a&#10;letter in the French language in reply to that of her correspondent,&#10;she dictated to Briggs a furious answer in her own native tongue,&#10;repudiating Mrs. Rawdon Crawley altogether, and warning the public to&#10;beware of her as a most artful and dangerous person.  But as Madame the&#10;Duchess of X--had only been twenty years in England, she did not&#10;understand a single word of the language, and contented herself by&#10;informing Mrs. Rawdon Crawley at their next meeting, that she had&#10;received a charming letter from that chere Me" />

Prussians and&#10;Cossacks, Spanish and English--all the world was at Paris during this&#10;famous winter:  to have seen the stars and cordons in Rebecca's humble&#10;saloon would have made all Baker Street pale with envy. Famous warriors&#10;rode by her carriage in the Bois, or crowded her modest little box at&#10;the Opera. Rawdon was in the highest spirits. There were no duns in&#10;Paris as yet:  there were parties every day at Very's or Beauvilliers';&#10;play was plentiful and his luck good. Tufto perhaps was sulky.  Mrs.&#10;Tufto had come over to Paris at her own invitation, and besides this&#10;contretemps, there were a score of generals now round Becky's" />

It was curious to&#10;see how the great ladies forgot her, and no doubt not altogether a&#10;pleasant study to Rebecca.  When Lady Bareacres met her in the&#10;waiting-room at the opera, she gathered her daughters about her as if&#10;they would be contaminated by a touch of Becky, and retreating a step&#10;or two, placed herself in front of them, and stared at her little&#10;enemy. To stare Becky out of countenance required a severer glance than&#10;even the frigid old Bareacres could shoot out of her dismal eyes.  When&#10;Lady de la Mole, who had ridden a score of times by Becky's side at&#10;Brussels, met Mrs. Crawley's open carriage in Hyde Park, her Ladyship&#10;was quite blind, and could not in the least" />

The novelist, who&#10;knows everything, knows this also.

Even Mrs. Blenkinsop, the banker's wife, cut her at church.&#10;Becky went regularly to church now; it was edifying to see her enter&#10;there with Rawdon by her side, carrying a couple of large gilt&#10;prayer-books, and afterwards going through the ceremony with the&#10;gravest resignation.&#10;&#10;Rawdon at first felt very acutely the slights which were passed upon&#10;his wife, and was inclined to be gloomy and savage.  He talked of&#10;calling out the husbands or brothers of every one of the insolent women&#10;who did not pay a proper respect to his wife; and it was only by the&#10;strongest commands and entreaties on her part that he was brought into&#10;keeping a decent behaviour.  &quot;You can't shoot me into society,&quot; she&#10;said good-naturedly.  &quot;Remember, my dear, that I was but a governess,&#10;and you, you poor silly old man, have the worst reputation for debt,&#10;and dice, and all sorts" />
    <node id=" Miss&#10;Crawley's gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends, Rawdon&#10;and his lady, who hoped for the best from their aunt's evidently&#10;pacified humour:  and they took care to entertain her with many&#10;delightful letters from Paris, whither, as Rawdon said, they had the&#10;good luck to go in the track of the conquering army.&#10;&#10;To the rector's lady, who went off to tend her husband's broken&#10;collar-bone at the Rectory at Queen's Crawley, the spinster's&#10;communications were by no means so gracious.  Mrs. Bute, that brisk,&#10;managing, lively, imperious woman, had committed the most fatal of all&#10;errors with regard to her sister-in-law.  She had not merely oppressed&#10;her and her household--she had bored Miss Crawley; and if poor Miss&#10;Briggs had been a woman of any spirit, she might have been made happy&#10;by the commission which her principal gave her to write a letter to&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley, saying that Miss Crawley's health was greatly&#10;improved since Mrs. Bute had left her, and begging the latter on no&#10;account to put herself" />
    <node id="The passage describes the intense feelings of anticipation and anxiety experienced by people in England as they read daily lists of casualties during battles in Flanders. This was in the context of the Napoleonic Wars, where millions of people were fighting across Europe. The question asks us to imagine how much more profound the emotions might have been for people in Europe, who endured twenty years of constant news about casualties and battles involving large numbers of soldiers.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights the emotional impact of even a single battle with only twenty thousand combatants on readers in England. Given this context, it is likely that European populations experiencing multiple such battles over two decades would have experienced much stronger feelings of anticipation, anxiety, grief, and loss. The frequency and scale of casualties during this period would have made people more emotionally invested and sensitive to news about military losses, as they directly affected a larger number of families and communities across Europe.&#10;&#10;In summary, the constant flow of news about casualties and battles during the twenty years preceding the time when the Osbornes received significant news from a famous Gazette would have led to deeply felt emotions and profound sadness among people in Europe, who would have experienced grief and loss on an even larger scale than the example given in the passage." />

The congregation&#10;made way respectfully for those sobbing girls clothed in deep black,&#10;and pitied the stern old father seated opposite the memorial of the&#10;dead soldier.  &quot;Will he forgive Mrs. George?&quot; the girls said to&#10;themselves as soon as their ebullition of grief was over. Much&#10;conversation passed too among the acquaintances of the Osborne family,&#10;who knew of the rupture between the son and father caused by the&#10;former's marriage, as to the chance of a reconciliation with the young&#10;widow. There" />

The girls indulged&#10;unrestrained in their grief.  The gloom-stricken old father was still&#10;more borne down by his fate and sorrow.  He strove to think that a&#10;judgment was on the boy for his disobedience.  He dared not own that&#10;the severity of the sentence frightened him, and that its fulfilment&#10;had come too soon upon his curses.  Sometimes a shuddering terror&#10;struck him, as if he had been the author of the doom which he had&#10;called down on his son.  There was a chance before of reconciliation.&#10;The boy's wife might have died; or he might have come back and said,&#10;Father I have sinned.  But there was no hope now.  He stood on the&#10;other side of the gulf impassable, haunting his parent with sad eyes.&#10;He remembered them once before so in a fever, when every one thought&#10;the lad was dying, and he lay on his bed speechless, and gazing with a&#10;dreadful gloom." />

It seemed a&#10;humiliation to old Osborne to think that his son, an English gentleman,&#10;a captain in the famous British army, should not be found worthy to lie&#10;in ground where mere foreigners were buried.  Which of us is there can&#10;tell how much vanity lurks in our warmest regard for others, and how&#10;selfish our love is? Old Osborne did not speculate much upon the&#10;mingled nature of his feelings, and how his instinct and selfishness&#10;were combating together.  He firmly believed that everything he did was&#10;right, that he ought on all occasions to have his own way--and like the&#10;sting of a wasp or serpent his hatred rushed out armed and poisonous&#10;against anything like opposition.  He was proud of his hatred as of&#10;everything else.  Always to be right, always to trample forward, and&#10;never to doubt, are not these the great qualities with which dullness&#10;takes the lead in the world?&#10;&#10;As after the drive to Waterloo, Mr. Osborne's carriage was nearing the&#10;gates of" />

He only said, that on&#10;the eve of a great battle, he wished to bid his father farewell, and&#10;solemnly to implore his good offices for the wife--it might be for the&#10;child--whom he left behind him.  He owned with contrition that his&#10;irregularities and his extravagance had already wasted a large part of&#10;his mother's little fortune.  He thanked his father for his former&#10;generous conduct; and he promised him that if he fell on the field or&#10;survived it, he would act in a manner worthy of the name of George&#10;Osborne.&#10;&#10;His English habit, pride, awkwardness perhaps, had prevented him from&#10;saying more.  His father could not see the kiss George had placed on&#10;the superscription of his letter.  Mr. Osborne dropped it with the&#10;bitterest, deadliest pang of balked affection and revenge. His son was&#10;still beloved and unforgiven.&#10;&#10;About two months afterwards, however, as the young ladies of the" />

Along this road they retreated on the next day, and here was the&#10;bank at which the regiment bivouacked under the rain of the night of&#10;the seventeenth.  Further on was the position which they took and held&#10;during the day, forming time after time to receive the charge of the&#10;enemy's horsemen and lying down under the shelter of the bank from the&#10;furious French cannonade.

Their movements were only checked by the advance of the British&#10;in their rear.  Thus forced to halt, the enemy's cavalry (whose&#10;bloodthirsty obstinacy cannot be too severely reprehended) had at&#10;length an opportunity of coming to close quarters with the brave&#10;Belgians before them; who preferred to encounter the British rather&#10;than the French, and at once turning tail rode through the English&#10;regiments that were behind them, and scattered in all directions.

He did not tell the&#10;Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship,&#10;who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most delightful and&#10;majestic impression on Miss Crawley.&#10;&#10;And so, nothing loth to comfort a sick lady, and perhaps not sorry in&#10;her heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the&#10;Reverend Bartholomew Irons, and the serious toadies who gathered round&#10;the footstool of the pompous Countess, her mam" />

He was Colonel Crawley no more.  He was Mrs. Crawley's husband.&#10;&#10;About the little Rawdon, if nothing has been said all this while, it is&#10;because he is hidden upstairs in a garret somewhere, or has crawled&#10;below into the kitchen for companionship.  His mother scarcely ever&#10;took notice of him.  He passed the days with" />
    <node id="the stranger voted himself in a little paradise of domestic comfort and&#10;agreed that, if the husband was rather stupid, the wife was charming,&#10;and the dinners the pleasantest in the world.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's wit, cleverness, and flippancy made her speedily the vogue in&#10;London among a certain class.  You saw demure chariots at her door, out&#10;of which stepped very great people.  You beheld her carriage in the&#10;park, surrounded by dandies of note.  The little box in the third tier&#10;of the opera was crowded with heads constantly changing; but it must be&#10;confessed that the ladies held aloof from her, and that their doors&#10;were shut to our little adventurer.&#10;&#10;With regard to the world of female fashion and its customs, the present&#10;writer of course can only speak at second hand.  A man can no more&#10;penetrate or understand those mysteries than he can know what the&#10;ladies talk about when they go upstairs after dinner.  It is only by&#10;inquiry and perseverance that one sometimes gets hints of those&#10;secrets; and by a similar diligence every person who treads the Pall&#10;Mall pavement and frequents" />
    <node id="Rebecca's plan to secure a better future for herself and Rawdon involved several steps. First, she had Crawley sell out of the Guards and go on half-pay, which would allow him to be available for other appointments or positions in their own country or the colonies. She also made sure to ridicule General Tufto in various companies, which would help clear the way for her to make a move upon England by damaging Tufto's reputation and standing. Rebecca was a shrewd and calculating character, who saw that their current lifestyle in Paris, although easy and pleasant, was not a sustainable solution for their future. She knew that she needed to take action to secure a more stable financial future for herself and Rawdon, and her plan involved positioning Crawley for a better appointment and undermining anyone who stood in their way." />
    <node id="little suppers, &amp;c., gentlemen were tired of play with him, and, in&#10;spite of Rebecca's charms, did not present themselves very eagerly.&#10;&#10;Easy and pleasant as their life at Paris was, it was after all only an&#10;idle dalliance and amiable trifling; and Rebecca saw that she must push&#10;Rawdon's fortune in their own country.  She must get him a place or&#10;appointment at home or in the colonies, and she determined to make a&#10;move upon England as soon as the way could be cleared for her.  As a&#10;first step she had made Crawley sell out of the Guards and go on&#10;half-pay.  His function as aide-de-camp to General Tufto had ceased&#10;previously. Rebecca laughed in all companies at that officer, at his&#10;toupee (which he mounted on coming to Paris), at his waistband, at his&#10;false teeth, at his pretensions to be a lady-killer above all, and his&#10;absurd vanity in fancying every woman whom he came near was in love&#10;with him.  It was to Mrs. Brent, the beetle-browed wife of Mr.&#10;Commissary Brent," />
    <node id=" hearing of the&#10;dispute sent for Colonel Crawley, who was getting ready the same&#10;pistols &quot;which he shot Captain Marker,&quot; and had such a conversation&#10;with him that no duel took place.  If Rebecca had not gone on her knees&#10;to General Tufto, Crawley would have been sent back to England; and he&#10;did not play, except with civilians, for some weeks after.&#10;&#10;But, in spite of Rawdon's undoubted skill and constant successes, it&#10;became evident to Rebecca, considering these things, that their&#10;position was but a precarious one, and that, even although they paid&#10;scarcely anybody, their little capital would end one day by dwindling&#10;into zero.  &quot;Gambling,&quot; she would say, &quot;dear, is good to help your&#10;income, but not as an income itself.  Some day people may be tired of&#10;play, and then where are we?&quot; Rawdon acquiesced in the justice of her&#10;opinion; and in truth he had remarked that after a few nights of his&#10;little suppers, &amp;c., gentlemen were tired of play with him, and, in&#10;spite of Rebecca's charms, did not present themselves very eagerly" />
    <node id=",&#10;why did you break your collar-bone?&quot;&#10;&#10;Why, indeed?  We have seen how Mrs. Bute, having the game in her hands,&#10;had really played her cards too well. She had ruled over Miss Crawley's&#10;household utterly and completely, to be utterly and completely routed&#10;when a favourable opportunity for rebellion came. She and her&#10;household, however, considered that she had been the victim of horrible&#10;selfishness and treason, and that her sacrifices in Miss Crawley's&#10;behalf had met with the most savage ingratitude. Rawdon's promotion,&#10;and the honourable mention made of his name in the Gazette, filled this&#10;good Christian lady also with alarm.  Would his aunt relent towards him&#10;now that he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and a C.B.? and would that odious&#10;Rebecca once more get into favour? The Rector's wife wrote a sermon for&#10;her husband about the vanity of military glory and the prosperity of&#10;the wicked, which the worthy parson read in his best voice and without&#10;understanding one syllable of it.  He had Pitt Crawley for one of his&#10;auditors--Pitt, who had come with his two half" />
    <node id=", she was so&#10;charmed with the letter that she expected her husband would instantly&#10;divide his aunt's legacy into two equal portions and send off one-half&#10;to his brother at Paris.&#10;&#10;To her Ladyship's surprise, however, Pitt declined to accommodate his&#10;brother with a cheque for thirty thousand pounds.  But he made Rawdon a&#10;handsome offer of his hand whenever the latter should come to England&#10;and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs. Crawley for her good opinion&#10;of himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to&#10;take any opportunity to serve her little boy.&#10;&#10;Thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers.&#10;When Rebecca came to town Pitt and his wife were not in London.  Many a&#10;time she drove by the old door in Park Lane to see whether they had&#10;taken possession of Miss Crawley's house there. But the new family did&#10;not make its appearance; it was only through Raggles that she heard of&#10;their movements--how Miss Crawley's domestics had been dismissed with&#10;decent gratuities, and how Mr. Pitt had only once made his appearance&#10;in London, when he stopped for a few" />
    <node id=" pygmy&#10;young Rawdon's great father was pleased to mount the boy, and to walk&#10;by his side in the park.  It pleased him to see his old quarters, and&#10;his old fellow-guardsmen at Knightsbridge: he had begun to think of his&#10;bachelorhood with something like regret.  The old troopers were glad to&#10;recognize their ancient officer and dandle the little colonel. Colonel&#10;Crawley found dining at mess and with his brother-officers very&#10;pleasant. &quot;Hang it, I ain't clever enough for her--I know it.  She&#10;won't miss me,&quot; he used to say:  and he was right, his wife did not&#10;miss him.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was fond of her husband.  She was always perfectly good-humoured&#10;and kind to him.  She did not even show her scorn much for&#10;him; perhaps she liked him the better for being a fool.  He was her&#10;upper servant and maitre d'hotel.  He went on her errands; obeyed her&#10;orders without question; drove in the carriage in the ring with her&#10;without repining; took her to the opera-box, solaced" />
    <node id="Based on the conversation heard in the kitchen, it appears that the British army suffered a significant defeat at the battle, with the Duke of Brunswick being killed in the fighting.

    <node id="The news about the son's enemy wounding an innocent person intensifies the grief and shock experienced by the Osbornes. This development further emphasizes the dire consequences of George's actions in disobeying his father and joining the army, ultimately leading to his death. The father, Mr. Osborne, is described as being &quot;gloom-stricken&quot; and feeling a sense of judgment for his son's disobedience. He tries to convince himself that his curse on George has come too soon, but deep down, he feels responsible for the tragic outcome.&#10;&#10;Regarding the irreconcilable situation with his son, Mr. Osborne struggles with a mix of emotions including fear, regret, and a stubborn sense of pride. Although he wishes for reconciliation and realizes there is no hope now, he cannot bring himself to forgive George entirely. The father's feelings are further complicated when he learns about George's wife, who has been deeply affected by her husband's death and is pregnant with their child. Despite the widow's vulnerable condition, Mr. Osborne initially insists that she should return to her father's house rather than seeking his support.&#10;&#10;In summary, the news of George's enemy harming an innocent person amplifies the Osbornes' grief and highlights the irreversible consequences of George's actions. Mr. Osborne grapples with complex emotions such as fear, regret, and pride, making it difficult for him to reconcile with his son or offer forgiveness. The situation is further complicated by George's widow's condition, adding an element of responsibility towards the unborn child." />

    <node id="George Osborne is present in Lady Southdown's drawing-room, where he makes a betting proposition against Pitt Crawley to the ladies. The narrative does not provide specific details about why George Osborne is there. However, it can be inferred that he is visiting Lady Southdown or perhaps socializing with the other guests.&#10;&#10;The text suggests that George Osborne's behavior towards Pitt Crawley is not friendly. When Pitt enters the drawing-room, George proposes a bet to the ladies, wagering that Pitt will not stay long before leaving in anger due to his contentious relationship with the Osborne family. This betting proposal demonstrates George's lack of respect for Pitt and their strained familial ties, prompting him to make such a disrespectful wager in front of the other ladies present." />

    <node id="Pitt Crawley's success in gaining favor with Miss Crawley can be attributed to several factors. First, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and received a Companion of the Bath (C.B.), which increased his social standing and made him more respectable in her eyes. Second, when Miss Crawley's household, led by Mrs. Bute, left her side due to various grievances, Pitt stepped in and filled the void. He became more present in Miss Crawley's life, building a relationship with her and gaining her trust. Furthermore, when Rawdon and Rebecca were not in London, Pitt made sure to keep Miss Crawley informed about their activities, sharing delightful letters from Paris and emphasizing their connection to the conquering army, which likely appealed to her nationalistic sentiments.&#10;&#10;The Rector's family is furious about Pitt's success for several reasons. First, Mrs. Bute, the Rector's wife, had been the one managing Miss Crawley's household and expected to benefit from it. However, she made a &quot;monstrous fault&quot; by insulting Miss Briggs and being haughty and parsimonious towards Bowls and Firkin, which led to her dismissal. This loss of influence left the Rector's family without any informants in Miss Crawley's household, causing them to feel blindsided by Pitt's sudden rise in her favor. Additionally, Pitt's success has made the Rector's family envious and resentful since they had hoped that Rawdon would inherit a portion of Miss Crawley's wealth and send some of it their way." />
    <node id=" a great&#10;deal more than all, that passed at Miss Crawley's house at Brighton.&#10;Pitt was there more and more.  He did not come for months together to&#10;the Hall, where his abominable old father abandoned himself completely&#10;to rum-and-water, and the odious society of the Horrocks family. Pitt's&#10;success rendered the Rector's family furious, and Mrs. Bute regretted&#10;more (though she confessed less) than ever her monstrous fault in so&#10;insulting Miss Briggs, and in being so haughty and parsimonious to&#10;Bowls and Firkin, that she had not a single person left in Miss&#10;Crawley's household to give her information of what took place there.&#10;&quot;It was all Bute's collar-bone,&quot; she persisted in saying; &quot;if that had&#10;not broke, I never would have left her.  I am a martyr to duty and to&#10;your odious unclerical habit of hunting, Bute.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hunting; nonsense!

His dog's aggressive behavior towards Miss Crawley's spaniel led to an awkward situation.&#10;&#10;During dinner, the lad was lively and facetious, even directing a few jokes at Pitt Crawley. He drank as much wine as the previous day and continued his entertaining stories in the drawing-room, describing the pugilistic qualities of certain individuals. This behavior made Lady Jane blush due to her social awkwardness and the presence of Mr. Pitt Crawley, with whom she had developed a relationship.&#10;&#10;The consequences of his behavior were that both he and Mr. Pitt Crawley, as well as Lady Jane, found themselves in an embarrassing social situation.

A circumstance which Jim&#10;had forgotten--a trivial but fatal circumstance--had taken place at the&#10;Cribb's Arms on the night before he had come to his aunt's house.  It&#10;was no other than this--Jim, who was always of a generous disposition,&#10;and when in his cups especially hospitable, had in the course of the&#10;night treated the Tutbury champion and the Rottingdean man, and their&#10;friends, twice or thrice to the refreshment of gin-and-water--so that&#10;no less than eighteen glasses of that fluid at eightpence per glass&#10;were charged in Mr. James Crawley's bill.

    <node id="In the narrative, Major Dobbin played a significant role in settling the financial matters when George Osborne (also known as George Sedley in the story) passed away. Although Osborne had left some assets with the agent at the time of his death, it was later discovered that the amount was not sufficient to cover the five hundred pounds that Major Dobbin proposed to use for George's widow and child.&#10;&#10;Upon investigation, it was found that Major Dobbin had given all the money himself, having buried his friend and paid all the fees and charges incident upon the calamity and removal of poor Amelia. However, Major Dobbin lied about this fact to George's father, Mr. Sedley, to avoid any conflict and ensure that the money reached Amelia and her son.&#10;&#10;The reason why Sedley's family did not take on the responsibility of settling the financial matters is not explicitly stated in the narrative. However, it can be inferred that they might have been unaware of George's financial situation or were unwilling to handle it due to various reasons such as their own financial constraints or personal issues with George.

Georgy inherited his father's&#10;pride, and perhaps thought they were not wrong.&#10;&#10;When he grew to be about six years old, Dobbin began to write to him&#10;very much.  The Major wanted to hear that Georgy was going to a school&#10;and hoped he would acquit himself with credit there:  or would he have&#10;a good tutor at home? It was time that he should begin to learn; and&#10;his godfather and guardian hinted that he hoped to be allowed to defray&#10;the charges of the boy's education, which would fall heavily upon his&#10;mother's straitened income.  The Major, in a word, was always thinking&#10;about Amelia and her little boy, and by orders to his agents kept the&#10;latter provided with picture-books, paint-boxes, desks, and all&#10;conceivable implements of amusement and instruction.

    <node id="Based on the passage, it is evident that Mrs. Amelia has a very close and intense emotional relationship with her son, George. She pours out her sentimental secrets and speaks constantly to him about her dead father, which suggests that she considers him an empathetic confidant despite his young age. This contrasts with her reluctance to talk about these matters with her parents or any confidante of her youth, indicating that she perceives George as a more understanding listener than the others in her life.&#10;&#10;This behavior could be attributed to the fact that Mrs. Amelia sees a resemblance between George and her late husband, making their bond even more significant for her. The passage also highlights how motherly love drives Amelia to express her feelings openly with George, reaching joys that are &quot;higher and lower than reason&quot; and &quot;blind beautiful devotions which only women's hearts know.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Mrs. Amelia's relationship with George is characterized by an emotional openness and closeness that contrasts with her more reserved behavior towards others in her life. This could be due to the resemblance she perceives between George and his father, as well as a profound expression of motherly love." />

To her parents she never talked about&#10;this matter, shrinking from baring her heart to them.  Little George&#10;very likely could understand no better than they, but into his ears she&#10;poured her sentimental secrets unreservedly, and into his only.  The&#10;very joy of this woman was a sort of grief, or so tender, at least,&#10;that its expression was tears.  Her sensibilities were so weak and&#10;tremulous that perhaps they ought not to be talked about in a book. I&#10;was told by Dr. Pestler (now a most flourishing lady's physician, with&#10;a sumptuous dark green carriage, a prospect of speedy knighthood, and a&#10;house in Manchester Square) that her grief at weaning the child was a&#10;sight that would have unmanned a Herod.

Here it was that she&#10;tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with&#10;a constant passion of love.  The elder George returned in him somehow,&#10;only improved, and as if come back from heaven.  In a hundred little&#10;tones, looks, and movements, the child was so like his father that the&#10;widow's heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would often ask&#10;the cause of her tears.

For almost all men who came near her loved&#10;her; though no doubt they would be at a loss to tell you why.  She was&#10;not brilliant, nor witty, nor wise over much, nor extraordinarily&#10;handsome.  But wherever she went she touched and charmed every one of&#10;the male sex, as invariably as she awakened the scorn and incredulity&#10;of her own sisterhood.  I think it was her weakness which was her&#10;principal charm--a kind of sweet submission and softness, which seemed&#10;to appeal to each man she met for his sympathy and protection.

But she supposed&#10;Glorvina could not be like her old acquaintance, who was most&#10;kind--but--but she was very happy indeed.  And by some impulse of which&#10;I cannot explain the meaning, she took George in her arms and kissed&#10;him with an extraordinary tenderness." />

And&#10;so, gently, he bore his fate, knowing it, and content to bear it.&#10;&#10;I suppose Amelia's father and mother saw through the intentions of the&#10;Major, and were not ill-disposed to encourage him; for Dobbin visited&#10;their house daily, and stayed for hours with them, or with Amelia, or&#10;with the honest landlord, Mr. Clapp, and his family.  He brought, on&#10;one pretext or another, presents to everybody, and almost every day;&#10;and went, with the landlord's little girl, who was rather a favourite&#10;with Amelia, by the name of Major Sugarplums.

    <node id="The Jenkins family's extravagant lifestyle is not sustainable on their income of 1200 pounds a year as Commissioner of the Tape and Sealing Wax Office. The narrative mentions several expenses for the Jenkins family that would be quite costly, including wages for three men and a carriage, dinners, education for their boys at Eton, a prize governess and masters for their girls, a trip abroad or to Eastbourne or Worthing in the autumn, an annual ball with supper from Gunter's, and various other costs. It is noted that many people wonder how the Jenkinses make out matters, as it seems unlikely that their income would be sufficient to cover all of these expenses. The narrative suggests that the Jenkins family may be living beyond their means, and it is mentioned that some families are driven to roguery and ruin by great practitioners in Crawley's way, which could imply that the Jenkins family may be engaging in dishonest activities in order to maintain their lifestyle.

    <node id="Colonial Crawley, husband of Rebecca (formerly Miss Crawley), frequently accompanies her to social gatherings, particularly in the Faubourg St. Germain and the new Court of Paris. However, as a former military officer, he often finds himself left out of the conversations due to the language barrier and his lack of comprehension of their sophisticated language and wit. His evenings at these events are likely filled with him sitting in silence, feeling wearisome and disconnected from the lively social interactions happening around him. He eventually stops attending these gatherings with his wife, preferring to spend his time with friends of his own choosing and engaging in simple pursuits that he enjoys." />

    <node id="Colonel Crawley, once a respected military officer, has been reduced to being referred to as &quot;Mrs. Crawley's husband&quot; in society. His wife Rebecca (Mrs. Crawley) is the center of attention and admiration in social circles, leaving him feeling isolated and excluded due to his lack of comprehension of their sophisticated conversations and jokes. This must have been wearisome for the ex-dragoon Colonel.&#10;&#10;Regarding their son, Little Rawdon, he is often neglected by his mother. The narrative describes him as being hidden upstairs in a garret or crawling below into the kitchen for companionship. His mother scarcely notices him, and there is no mention of any affectionate interaction between them. This lack of attention to her child further highlights Rebecca's self-centered personality.&#10;&#10;In summary, Colonel Crawley's experience as Mrs. Crawley's husband has relegated him to the sidelines of society, and his son, Little Rawdon, is frequently overlooked by his mother, who is more concerned with her own social status than caring for her child." />

Amelia was the wife of their close friend and patient, Captain Osborne, who had passed away. Estler and Pestler were likely motivated by their loyalty to Captain Osborne and their desire to support his family. Additionally, Amelia herself asked for extra care to be taken for Georgy, while she did not have the same relationship with the other children mentioned.

Did they sit up for little Mary Clapp, the landlord's&#10;daughter, who actually caught the disease of little Georgy? Truth&#10;compels one to say, no. They slept quite undisturbed, at least as far&#10;as she was concerned--pronounced hers to be a slight case, which would&#10;almost cure itself, sent her in a draught or two, and threw in bark&#10;when the child rallied, with perfect indifference, and just for form's&#10;sake.&#10;&#10;Again, there was the little French chevalier opposite, who gave lessons&#10;in his native tongue at various schools in the neighbourhood, and who&#10;might be heard in his apartment of nights playing tremulous old&#10;" />

    <node id="Miss Crawley is particularly irritable and sarcastic towards Miss Briggs when she is recovering from illness because she feels more vigorous during her recovery, and sarcasm is a way for her to assert her dominance. This is comparable to the painful ordeal that women like Miss Briggs have to endure in such situations, as described in the narrative: &quot;What tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily repeated shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the tyrants of their sex?&quot; This suggests that the power dynamics between women can be just as painful and oppressive as those between men and women.

Additionally, Mrs. Bute may also regret her decision because she feels compassion for Miss Crawley's current situation and regrets causing any further discomfort or distress by showing up unannounced.

It wasn't until he visited his aunt's house that he got to enjoy both quantity and quality wine, which he seemed to appreciate immensely.&#10;&#10;James showed a particular interest in asking all the ladies to drink wine and accepted Mr. Crawley's challenge to consume a bottle of champagne, indicating that he is sociable and enjoys sharing wine with others. At his aunt's house, James was quick to drain off the second bottle supplied by Mr. Bowls, demonstrating his ability to handle and enjoy large amounts of wine.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that James had a generous disposition, particularly when intoxicated, as evidenced by him buying gin-and-water for the Tutbury champion, the Rottingdean man, and their friends at the Cribb's Arms.

Additionally, it may be helpful to engage in conversations related to her personal experiences, interests, or concerns, and then subtly weave in more serious considerations that connect to these subjects. This gradual approach will respect Miss Crawley's delicate condition and limited familiarity with such topics, making it more likely for her to accept and engage in the conversation." />

He also resorted to raising money on post-obits and encumbering the family estate.&#10;&#10;The Earl adopted more extravagant habits, such as driving four-in-hand and patronizing the ring, which further alarmed his mother.

    <edge source="The never-ending source of conflict between the English and French, as described in the narrative, is a cycle of pride, violence, and desire for revenge that has lasted for centuries. This is exemplified by the battle referred to as &quot;in every Englishman's mouth,&quot; where English and French soldiers engage in fierce combat, with the English infantry repelling the charges of French horsemen throughout the day. The French side suffers heavy casualties, and their attack eventually weakens. When the French Imperial Guard launches a final assault, they are met with resolute resistance from the English troops, who break through the Guard's formation and cause them to retreat.&#10;&#10;This long-standing conflict is fueled by the desire for glory and honor, as well as the bitter taste of past defeats. The narrative highlights how this hatred and rage can be passed down through generations, creating a cycle where Frenchmen and Englishmen &quot;might be boasting and killing each other still.&quot;&#10;&#10;The passage also touches upon the impact of war on civilians, describing the alarm and panic in Brussels as people await news from the battlefield. The description of women rushing to churches and praying for the safety of their loved ones underscores the widespread fear and anxiety that accompanies war.&#10;&#10;In summary, the never-ending source of conflict between the English and French is a deeply ingrained cycle of violence, revenge, and desire for glory, which has resulted in centuries of fighting and animosity between the two nations." target="  The tale is&#10;in every Englishman's mouth; and you and I, who were children when the&#10;great battle was won and lost, are never tired of hearing and&#10;recounting the history of that famous action.

First, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and received a Companion of the Bath (C.B.), which increased his social standing and made him more respectable in her eyes. Second, when Miss Crawley's household, led by Mrs. Bute, left her side due to various grievances, Pitt stepped in and filled the void. He became more present in Miss Crawley's life, building a relationship with her and gaining her trust. Furthermore, when Rawdon and Rebecca were not in London, Pitt made sure to keep Miss Crawley informed about their activities, sharing delightful letters from Paris and emphasizing their connection to the conquering army, which likely appealed to her nationalistic sentiments.&#10;&#10;The Rector's family is furious about Pitt's success for several reasons. First, Mrs. Bute, the Rector's wife, had been the one managing Miss Crawley's household and expected to benefit from it. However, she made a &quot;monstrous fault&quot; by insulting Miss Briggs and being haughty and parsimonious towards Bowls and Firkin, which led to her dismissal. This loss of influence left the Rector's family without any informants in Miss Crawley's household, causing them to feel blindsided by Pitt's sudden rise in her favor. Additionally, Pitt's success has made the Rector's family envious and resentful since they had hoped that Rawdon would inherit a portion of Miss Crawley's wealth and send some of it their way.">

The narrative describes him as being hidden upstairs in a garret or crawling below into the kitchen for companionship. His mother scarcely notices him, and there is no mention of any affectionate interaction between them. This lack of attention to her child further highlights Rebecca's self-centered personality.&#10;&#10;In summary, Colonel Crawley's experience as Mrs. Crawley's husband has relegated him to the sidelines of society, and his son, Little Rawdon, is frequently overlooked by his mother, who is more concerned with her own social status than caring for her child.">

First, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and received a Companion of the Bath (C.B.), which increased his social standing and made him more respectable in her eyes. Second, when Miss Crawley's household, led by Mrs. Bute, left her side due to various grievances, Pitt stepped in and filled the void. He became more present in Miss Crawley's life, building a relationship with her and gaining her trust. Furthermore, when Rawdon and Rebecca were not in London, Pitt made sure to keep Miss Crawley informed about their activities, sharing delightful letters from Paris and emphasizing their connection to the conquering army, which likely appealed to her nationalistic sentiments.&#10;&#10;The Rector's family is furious about Pitt's success for several reasons. First, Mrs. Bute, the Rector's wife, had been the one managing Miss Crawley's household and expected to benefit from it. However, she made a &quot;monstrous fault&quot; by insulting Miss Briggs and being haughty and parsimonious towards Bowls and Firkin, which led to her dismissal. This loss of influence left the Rector's family without any informants in Miss Crawley's household, causing them to feel blindsided by Pitt's sudden rise in her favor. Additionally, Pitt's success has made the Rector's family envious and resentful since they had hoped that Rawdon would inherit a portion of Miss Crawley's wealth and send some of it their way.">

This development further emphasizes the dire consequences of George's actions in disobeying his father and joining the army, ultimately leading to his death. The father, Mr. Osborne, is described as being &quot;gloom-stricken&quot; and feeling a sense of judgment for his son's disobedience. He tries to convince himself that his curse on George has come too soon, but deep down, he feels responsible for the tragic outcome.&#10;&#10;Regarding the irreconcilable situation with his son, Mr. Osborne struggles with a mix of emotions including fear, regret, and a stubborn sense of pride. Although he wishes for reconciliation and realizes there is no hope now, he cannot bring himself to forgive George entirely. The father's feelings are further complicated when he learns about George's wife, who has been deeply affected by her husband's death and is pregnant with their child.

    <edge source="Pitt Crawley's success in gaining favor with Miss Crawley can be attributed to several factors. First, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and received a Companion of the Bath (C.B.), which increased his social standing and made him more respectable in her eyes. Second, when Miss Crawley's household, led by Mrs. Bute, left her side due to various grievances, Pitt stepped in and filled the void. He became more present in Miss Crawley's life, building a relationship with her and gaining her trust. Furthermore, when Rawdon and Rebecca were not in London, Pitt made sure to keep Miss Crawley informed about their activities, sharing delightful letters from Paris and emphasizing their connection to the conquering army, which likely appealed to her nationalistic sentiments.&#10;&#10;The Rector's family is furious about Pitt's success for several reasons. First, Mrs. Bute, the Rector's wife, had been the one managing Miss Crawley's household and expected to benefit from it. However, she made a &quot;monstrous fault&quot; by insulting Miss Briggs and being haughty and parsimonious towards Bowls and Firkin, which led to her dismissal. This loss of influence left the Rector's family without any informants in Miss Crawley's household, causing them to feel blindsided by Pitt's sudden rise in her favor.

Pitt's&#10;success rendered the Rector's family furious, and Mrs. Bute regretted&#10;more (though she confessed less) than ever her monstrous fault in so&#10;insulting Miss Briggs, and in being so haughty and parsimonious to&#10;Bowls and Firkin, that she had not a single person left in Miss&#10;Crawley's household to give her information of what took place there.&#10;&quot;It was all Bute's collar-bone,&quot; she persisted in saying; &quot;if that had&#10;not broke, I never would have left her.

<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" Skeleton keys are a type of master key that can open multiple locks, and in this narrative, Dr. Seward has a set of such keys. They are used to open the door to the house that they believe to be hiding the missing boxes of earth from Count Dracula's tomb. The keys are kept in Dr. Seward's pocket. They help Dr. Seward open the door without breaking in like before because he is able to find a skeleton key that fits the lock, allowing them to open the door quietly and without causing any damage."/>
<node id=" to me. Each of the others&#10;was similarly equipped. &quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;friend John, where are the&#10;skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house&#10;by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a&#10;surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after&#10;a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty&#10;clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and&#10;it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in&#10;Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that&#10;the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they&#10;shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped&#10;into the open door.&#10;&#10;&quot;_In manus tuas, Domine!_&quot; he said, crossing himself as he passed over&#10;the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have&#10;lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The"/>
<node id=" there&#10;were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid&#10;walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I&#10;took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.&#10;&#10;A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which&#10;he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for&#10;undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass&#10;of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew&#10;back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.&#10;&#10;For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was&#10;seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great&#10;iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,&#10;and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the&#10;huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver&#10;whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered&#10;from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and"/>
<node id=" a whit in our&#10;resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and&#10;bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found&#10;nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all&#10;untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.&#10;Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when&#10;we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been&#10;rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.&#10;&#10;The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.&#10;Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and&#10;locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket&#10;when he had done.&#10;&#10;&quot;So far,&quot; he said, &quot;our night has been eminently successful. No harm has&#10;come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how&#10;many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our&#10;first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been&#10;accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or&#10;troubling her waking or sleeping"/>
<node id=" pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered&#10;from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a&#10;minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.&#10;Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I&#10;noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been&#10;taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had&#10;elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to&#10;swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their&#10;moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look&#10;like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the&#10;threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting&#10;their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were&#10;multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.&#10;&#10;Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him&#10;on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to&#10;recover his courage, and rushed at"/>

He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as&#10;he had shown contempt to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so&#10;loved and honoured as our host"/>

She&#10;came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command&#10;the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad&#10;people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and&#10;held out her hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,&quot; said she. &quot;You see, I know you, for Dr.&#10;Seward has told me of you.&quot; He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all&#10;over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one&#10;of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he&#10;said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,&#10;you know, for she's dead.&quot; Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no!

<node id=" Based on the results of their search of the house, the group's first step in their plan can be considered a success. They were able to determine the number of missing boxes without any harm coming to them, and more importantly, they were able to carry out this step without involving or troubling Mina in any way. This is a significant achievement as it means that Mina was kept safe from the horrors of their investigation, at least for the time being.&#10;&#10;The condition of the dogs also supports the idea that the group's first step was a success. At no point did the dogs exhibit any signs of unease or discomfort during their search of the house. In fact, when they returned to the chapel, the dogs frisked about as if they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood. This suggests that there were no supernatural or evil presences in the house that could have harmed the dogs or the group.&#10;&#10;Overall, the results of the group's search of the house and the condition of the dogs indicate that their first step in their plan was a success and that Mina was kept safe from harm. However, the group acknowledges that there are still other dangers and fears to contend with, and they will need to remain vigilant in their pursuit of Dracula."/>
<node id=" may be other things to&#10;think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she&#10;must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and&#10;we go alone.&quot; I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we&#10;had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was&#10;the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed&#10;to come on him. &quot;Oh that we had known it before!&quot; he said, &quot;for then we&#10;might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk&#10;that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think&#10;of that, but go on our way to the end.&quot; Then he fell into a silence that&#10;lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for&#10;dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have&#10;put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not up to this moment, Professor,&quot; she said impuls"/>
<node id=", and carrying him in, placed him&#10;on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to&#10;recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before&#10;him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other&#10;dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey&#10;ere the whole mass had vanished.&#10;&#10;With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for&#10;the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at&#10;their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in&#10;the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.&#10;Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of&#10;the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves&#10;in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to&#10;slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something&#10;of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our&#10;resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and&#10;bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house"/>
<node id=" difficult and dangerous--step has been&#10;accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or&#10;troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and&#10;smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have&#10;learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute&#10;beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable&#10;to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his&#10;call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and&#10;to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell&#10;from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters&#10;before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used&#10;his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.&#10;So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity&#10;to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the&#10;stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,&#10;and we"/>
<node id=" me in a&#10;quiet, well-bred voice:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later&#10;on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy&#10;mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am&#10;so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.&#10;Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at&#10;all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and&#10;brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way&#10;that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and&#10;that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a&#10;little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his&#10;room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said&#10;to Dr. Seward:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Say, Jack,"/>
<node id=" *       *&#10;&#10;_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all&#10;overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no&#10;rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept&#10;till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or&#10;three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a&#10;few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of&#10;blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She&#10;complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the&#10;day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be&#10;that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace&#10;them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the&#10;sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas&#10;Snelling to-day.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was"/>
<node id=" From visiting Thomas Snelling, the lunatic who can talk philosophy and reason soundly about his delusion of consuming live things, several things can be learned:&#10;&#10;1. Obliquity of thought and memory: Van Helsing finds it fascinating to study Snelling's mental disease, as his folly might provide valuable insights, which could be more enlightening than teachings from the wisest men.&#10;&#10;2. Snelling's mental state: Snelling displays a higher level of understanding and rationality, unlike any other lunatic. He even shows an unusual level of self-awareness and assumes his reasons will be accepted by seemingly sane people.&#10;&#10;3. Snelling's fixation: His fixation on consuming live things to prolong life is a significant aspect of his delusion. He even attempted to take human life to strengthen his vital powers by assimilating their blood, as per the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is the life.'&#10;&#10;4. Snelling's lucidity: During the visit, Snelling appears coherent and reasonable, making it difficult to believe he had just eaten flies and spiders. This contrast highlights the unpredictable nature of his mental state.&#10;&#10;5. Influence of Mrs. Harker: Her presence and interaction with Snelling seem to have a calming effect on him. Van Helsing believes this is due to her unconscious influence and some rare gift or power she possesses.&#10;&#10;In summary, visiting Thomas Snelling offers a unique opportunity to study the complexities of mental illness, the contrast between sanity and delusion, and the potential influence of certain individuals on the mental state of others."/>
<node id=" Thomas&#10;Snelling to-day.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor&#10;walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it&#10;is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the&#10;brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the&#10;night he suddenly said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him&#10;this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may&#10;be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,&#10;and reason so sound.&quot; I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him&#10;that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to&#10;keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary&#10;instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against&#10;getting any false impression from my patient. &quot;But,&quot; he answered, &quot;I&#10;want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live&#10;things. He said to Madam"/>
<node id=". &quot;But,&quot; he answered, &quot;I&#10;want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live&#10;things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that&#10;he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Excuse me,&quot; I said, &quot;but the answer is here.&quot; I laid my hand on the&#10;type-written matter. &quot;When our sane and learned lunatic made that very&#10;statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually&#10;nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.&#10;Harker entered the room.&quot; Van Helsing smiled in turn. &quot;Good!&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it&#10;is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease&#10;such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the&#10;folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.&#10;Who knows?&quot; I went on with my work, and before long was through that in&#10;hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but"/>
<node id=" and the Tropics may hold&#10;alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a&#10;vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true&#10;place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at&#10;meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of&#10;conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics&#10;by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,&#10;conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to&#10;one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by&#10;the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective&#10;places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at&#10;least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.&#10;And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as&#10;well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to&#10;be considered as under exceptional circumstances.&quot; He made this last&#10;appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own&#10;charm."/>
<node id=" when his mind is&#10;disturbed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;May I come also?&quot; asked Lord Godalming.&#10;&#10;&quot;Me too?&quot; said Quincey Morris. &quot;May I come?&quot; said Harker. I nodded, and&#10;we all went down the passage together.&#10;&#10;We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more&#10;rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an&#10;unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever&#10;met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would&#10;prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but&#10;none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would&#10;at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up&#10;with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own&#10;existing sanity. &quot;I appeal to your friends,&quot; he said, &quot;they will,&#10;perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have&#10;not introduced me.&quot; I was so much astonished, that the oddness of&#10;introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,"/>
<node id="way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or&#10;power.&#10;&#10;We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly&#10;quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she&#10;began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for&#10;he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the&#10;completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned&#10;certain things.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,&#10;it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being&#10;put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and&#10;perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no&#10;matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong&#10;life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to&#10;take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I&#10;tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by&#10;the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his&#10;blood--relying, of course, upon"/>
<node id=" of strengthening my vital powers by&#10;the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his&#10;blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is&#10;the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has&#10;vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,&#10;doctor?&quot; I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to&#10;either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up&#10;his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I&#10;saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.&#10;Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying&#10;pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: &quot;Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,&#10;under auspices pleasanter to yourself,&quot; to which, to my astonishment, he&#10;replied:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.&#10;May He bless and keep you!&quot;&#10;&#10;When I went to the station to"/>
<node id=" Yes, according to Dr. Seward's diary, Mrs. Harker (Mina Harker) wrote all the papers and diaries regarding Lucy's death that she and her husband, Jonathan Harker, typewritten and organized. Dr. Seward mentions that he let time run on without thinking and Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, implying that she was still occupied with typing. Later, Harker and his wife were in their own room, hard at work typing and knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they had."/>
<node id=" was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my&#10;guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,&#10;after a quick glance, said: &quot;Dr. Seward, is it not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you are Mrs. Harker!&quot; I answered at once; whereupon she held out&#10;her hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----&quot; She stopped&#10;suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.&#10;&#10;The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it&#10;was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a&#10;typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had&#10;sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom&#10;prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.&#10;&#10;In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a&#10;lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder&#10;when we entered.&#10;&#10;She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as&#10;"/>
<node id=" Van&#10;Helsing, too, has been quite &quot;blowing my trumpet,&quot; as Mr. Morris&#10;expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all&#10;about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to&#10;say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they&#10;had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and&#10;came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post&#10;them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that&#10;they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear&#10;to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I&#10;could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband&#10;and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.&#10;I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got&#10;his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?&quot;&#10;&#10;I nodded, and"/>

If this journal be true--and&#10;judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man&#10;of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a&#10;remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was&#10;prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,&#10;business-like gentleman who came here to-day.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,&#10;and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They&#10;are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in&#10;chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got&#10;the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the&#10;carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's&#10;typescript"/>
<node id="You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.&#10;But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long&#10;ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make&#10;the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the&#10;first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify&#10;you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the&#10;meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better&#10;able to understand certain things.&quot; He carried the phonograph himself up&#10;to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something&#10;pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love&#10;episode of which I know one side already....&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan&#10;Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without&#10;thinking.

Goodness knows that we had enough clues&#10;     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters&#10;     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript.

<node id=", and oh, but he&#10;proved himself a friend!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming&#10;and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript&#10;of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife&#10;had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the&#10;carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave&#10;us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I&#10;have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had&#10;finished, Mrs. Harker said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.&#10;Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary&#10;interests me so much!&quot; She looked so appealing and so pretty that I&#10;could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so&#10;I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a&#10;lady would"/>
<node id=" Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, is insisting on being released immediately because he claims to have regained his sanity and is fighting for his soul. He believes that there are vampires in the neighborhood and that he must leave the asylum to escape their influence. However, Dr. Seward is hesitant to release him immediately, as he knows Renfield's character and history of sudden changes in behavior. He also wants to wait and observe Renfield's behavior in the morning before making a decision about his release. Renfield becomes increasingly agitated and insistent as the conversation goes on, leading Dr. Seward to physically guide him back to his bed."/>
<node id="&#10;be considered as under exceptional circumstances.&quot; He made this last&#10;appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own&#10;charm.&#10;&#10;I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the&#10;conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,&#10;that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to&#10;tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the&#10;necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it&#10;better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old&#10;I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.&#10;So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared&#10;to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him&#10;in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of&#10;meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said&#10;quickly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to&#10;go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time"/>
<node id="! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you&#10;understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and&#10;earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting&#10;for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!&quot;&#10;&#10;I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so&#10;would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come,&quot; I said sternly, &quot;no more of this; we have had quite enough&#10;already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.&quot;&#10;&#10;He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,&#10;without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the&#10;bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had&#10;expected.&#10;&#10;When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a&#10;quiet, well-bred voice:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear"/>

The Professor went on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the&#10;highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete&#10;reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since&#10;you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If&#10;you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can&#10;we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help&#10;us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.&quot; He still shook&#10;his head as he"/>

The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,&#10;and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us&#10;have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all&#10;be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this&#10;terrible and mysterious enemy.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal._&#10;&#10;_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after&#10;dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of&#10;board or committee.

So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph&#10;diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at&#10;the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before&#10;me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an&#10;opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or&#10;what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here&#10;she is!&#10;&#10;&#10;_Mina Harker's Journal._&#10;&#10;_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's&#10;study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking&#10;with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at&#10;the door, and on his calling out, &quot;Come in,&quot; I entered.&#10;&#10;To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,&#10;and on the table"/>
<node id="&#10;&#10;When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram&#10;waiting for him:--&#10;&#10;     &quot;Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby.

<node id=" Dr. Seward must deal with Renfield, who is currently his patient, as one who is under exceptional circumstances. This is because Renfield has valuable information about vampires, which is their current enemy. Renfield's claim of wanting to leave the asylum to escape the influence of vampires supports the group's belief that there are indeed vampires in the neighborhood. Therefore, Dr. Seward should consider Renfield's request and observe his behavior in the morning, as he usually does, but with greater urgency and attention to Renfield's insights about the vampires."/>

I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even&#10;occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing&#10;went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work&#10;had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,&#10;as any other transaction of life:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not&#10;without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power&#10;denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to&#10;act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.&#10;In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are&#10;free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to&#10;achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are&#10;restrict, and how the"/>
<node id=" Dr. Seward is unwilling to share details about Lucy's death from his diary because he realizes that he doesn't know how to locate a specific part of his diary should he need to look it up. The idea that dawned upon him is that the entire diary is not easily searchable, and it would be difficult to share only certain parts of it. This becomes clear when Mina Harker offers to type up his diary for him, and he refuses, stating that he wouldn't want her to know the &quot;terrible story.&quot; He is also concerned about protecting Mina from the horror of Lucy's death, but his primary reason for not sharing the details is the practical one of accessibility within his diary."/>
<node id=" face.&#10;&#10;&quot;The fact is,&quot; he began awkwardly, &quot;I only keep my diary in it; and as&#10;it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that&#10;is, I mean----&quot; He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his&#10;embarrassment:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;&#10;for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very&#10;dear to me.&quot;&#10;&#10;To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.&#10;Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.&#10;At length he stammered out:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the&#10;diary.&quot; Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said&#10;with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naivete&#10;of a child: &quot;That"/>

For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible&#10;story!&quot;&#10;&#10;Then it was terrible; my intuition was right!

<node id=" The odor in the place was described as a combination of all the ills of mortality, with a pungent, acrid smell of blood, and an intensified loathsomeness due to corruption. Despite the intense loathsomeness and nauseous smell, the group continued their work as they were on a high and terrible purpose. After the initial shrinking due to the first nauseous whiff, they examined the place, counting the number of boxes left and searching every hole, corner, and cranny for clues about the missing boxes. This was all done without involving or troubling Mina, keeping her safe from the horrors of their investigation. The condition of the dogs also supported the idea that there were no supernatural or evil presences in the house that could have harmed them, indicating the success of their first step in their plan."/>
<node id=" as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not&#10;alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the&#10;pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had&#10;become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath&#10;exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and&#10;intensified its loathsomeness.&#10;&#10;Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our&#10;enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and&#10;terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose&#10;above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking&#10;consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our&#10;work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.&#10;&#10;We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we&#10;began:--&#10;&#10;&quot;The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then&#10;examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some&#10;clue as to what has become of the rest.&quot; A glance"/>

With a little trouble we found the key on the&#10;bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for&#10;as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale&#10;through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we&#10;encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close&#10;quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of&#10;his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in&#10;a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and&#10;close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was&#10;an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler&#10;air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not&#10;alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the"/>

The&#10;Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it&#10;from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our&#10;lamps and proceeded on our search.&#10;&#10;The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the&#10;rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great&#10;shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there&#10;was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so&#10;powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible&#10;experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,&#10;for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every&#10;sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.&#10;&#10;The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches&#10;deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down&#10;my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked.

Their&#10;tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that&#10;the boxes were &quot;main and mortal heavy,&quot; and that shifting them was dry&#10;work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any&#10;gentleman &quot;such-like as yourself, squire,&quot; to show some sort of&#10;appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider&#10;that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had&#10;elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care&#10;before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of&#10;reproach.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_30 September"/>
<node id=" The man, who is a patient at the asylum, once held a strange belief that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, he could indefinitely prolong his life. This belief led him to attempt taking human life, as he believed that he could strengthen his vital powers by assimilating the life of another through their blood.&#10;&#10;This example of the man's delusion relates to the woman's (Mrs. Harker) potential rare gift or power in that her presence and interaction with the man during his episode of hysteria had a calming effect on him. Van Helsing believes that this is due to her unconscious influence and some rare gift or power she possesses. This contrasts with the man's delusion and his attempts to harm others in order to prolong his own life."/>
<node id=" selfish one. These things are much.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are&#10;restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the&#10;limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.&#10;&#10;&quot;All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not&#10;at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay&#10;of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the&#10;first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and&#10;secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and&#10;superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for&#10;others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would&#10;have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,&#10;sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief&#10;that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the&#10;vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the&#10;moment on the"/>

He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat&#10;his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat&#10;down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite&#10;pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his&#10;head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with&#10;emotion.&#10;&#10;We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above&#10;smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big&#10;sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby&#10;that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he&#10;were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.&#10;&#10;After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an&#10;apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for&#10;days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been&#10;unable to"/>

How then are we to&#10;begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having&#10;found it, how can we destroy?

<node id=" The strengths of the forces on their side in contending against the vampire kind include the power of combination, which is denied to the vampires; access to sources of science; the freedom to act and think; and the equality of day and night hours. Additionally, the humans have self-devotion in a cause that is not selfish, which gives them a moral advantage.&#10;&#10;The restrictions of the forces on their side include the fact that their knowledge about vampires is based on traditions and superstitions, which may not be reliable. They also have to contend with the limitations and abilities of the specific vampire they are facing, in this case, Count Dracula.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that the humans are aware of their own limitations and the need to be cautious, as seen in Dr. Seward's approach to questioning Jonathan Harker about his suspicions regarding Count Dracula's intentions."/>
<node id=" very eyes. Take it, then, that the&#10;vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the&#10;moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere&#10;that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany&#10;all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so&#10;far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at&#10;this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the&#10;devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we&#10;have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the&#10;beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy&#10;experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the&#10;time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the&#10;living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow&#10;younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though&#10;they refresh themselves when his special"/>

Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.&#10;Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the&#10;centre. The Professor said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts&#10;that are in these papers.&quot; We all expressed assent, and he went on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of&#10;enemy with which we have to deal.

Can it be that&#10;     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?&#10;     Stay; he is himself zooephagous, and in his wild ravings outside the&#10;     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of &quot;master.&quot; This&#10;     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came&#10;     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it&#10;     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,&#10;     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so&#10;     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to&#10;     have"/>
<node id=" The strange noises coming from Mr. Renfield's room could be attributed to his erratic behavior and delusional beliefs about vampires. The profuse praying on a tumultuous scale that Dr. Seward's patient was exhibiting might be a manifestation of his mental state, possibly indicating a religious fervor or a desperate attempt to ward off supernatural forces.&#10;&#10;The profound silence that followed could be a result of the asylum staff intervening and restraining Mr. Renfield, which would explain the sounds of a struggle that the narrator heard. This sudden shift from loud, fervent prayers to complete silence could have unnerved the narrator, making her feel uneasy due to the eerie and mysterious atmosphere it created.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrator's description of the black shadows in the moonlight and the thin streak of white mist creeping across the grass further adds to the unsettling ambiance, potentially heightening her anxiety and contributing to her uneasiness."/>
<node id="-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew&#10;that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my&#10;own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear&#10;fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do&#10;feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons&#10;that we poor women have to learn....&#10;&#10;I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing&#10;the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying&#10;on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere&#10;under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so&#10;profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.&#10;All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight&#10;seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be&#10;stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin&#10;streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness&#10;across"/>
<node id=" October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have&#10;slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the&#10;sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and&#10;spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.&#10;In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was&#10;very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless&#10;me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This&#10;is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be&#10;miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till&#10;dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten&#10;them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how&#10;tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke&#10;together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other&#10;of what had occurred to each during the day; I could"/>

I think that the digression of my thoughts must&#10;have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy&#10;creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out&#10;and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now&#10;close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the&#10;wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was&#10;more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,&#10;I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on&#10;his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the&#10;attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into&#10;bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.&#10;I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but"/>
<node id=" Mina Harker's sadness and low-spiritedness are due to her anxiety about the secret her husband, Jonathan, is keeping from her regarding their visit to the Count's house. She is also feeling the emotional impact of the recent tragic events, including the death of her friend Lucy, and is overwhelmed by the weight of these burdens. Additionally, she is experiencing a sense of guilt for her role in the chain of events that led to Lucy's death, and is struggling with feelings of regret and helplessness."/>

And now I am&#10;crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great&#10;love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.&#10;&#10;That has done me good.

<node id=".&#10;&#10;Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told&#10;me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I&#10;kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to&#10;see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate&#10;pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does&#10;seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which&#10;is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear&#10;Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard&#10;till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she&#10;wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at&#10;night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.&#10;Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby?

<node id=". How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of&#10;good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I&#10;remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's&#10;perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at&#10;Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the&#10;files of &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette,&quot; and took&#10;them to my room. I remember how much &quot;The Dailygraph&quot; and &quot;The Whitby&#10;Gazette,&quot; of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the&#10;terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look&#10;through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new&#10;light.

I suppose one ought to pity any&#10;thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not&#10;human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's&#10;death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in&#10;one's heart.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we&#10;expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with&#10;him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it&#10;brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Of&#10;course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van&#10;Helsing, too, has been quite &quot;blowing my trumpet,&quot; as Mr. Morris&#10;expressed it.

<node id=" The desperate plea comes from Renfield, Dr. Seward's patient. Renfield entreats Dr. Seward to let him leave the asylum immediately, claiming to have regained his sanity and fighting for his soul. He believes that there are vampires in the neighborhood and that he must escape their influence. However, Dr. Seward is hesitant due to Renfield's history of sudden changes in behavior and wants to observe his behavior in the morning before making a decision. Renfield becomes increasingly agitated and insistent as the conversation goes on."/>
<node id=" The men reacted with apprehension in the passage when they saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars, and realized that the place was becoming alive with rats. They all instinctively drew back, feeling nervous and alarmed. Lord Godalming, however, responded to the situation by taking immediate action. He rushed over to the great iron-bound oaken door, turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call, which was answered by the yelping of dogs from behind Dr. Seward's house. After about a minute, three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house, and Lord Godalming placed one of them on the floor inside the room. The dog, seeming to recover its courage, rushed at the rats and helped to drive them away."/>
<node id=" then&#10;examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some&#10;clue as to what has become of the rest.&quot; A glance was sufficient to show&#10;how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was&#10;no mistaking them.&#10;&#10;There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,&#10;for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted&#10;door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my&#10;heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to&#10;see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the&#10;red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,&#10;as Lord Godalming said, &quot;I thought I saw a face, but it was only the&#10;shadows,&quot; and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,&#10;and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there&#10;were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid&#10;walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-"/>

The attendant added:--&#10;&#10;&quot;He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't&#10;know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his&#10;violent fits.&quot; I knew the man would not have said this without some&#10;cause, so I said: &quot;All right; I'll go now&quot;; and I asked the others to&#10;wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my &quot;patient.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Take me with you, friend John,&quot; said the Professor. &quot;His case in your&#10;diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_&#10;case.

<node id=" The skeleton keys are a set of master keys that Dr. Seward owns, which can open multiple locks. In the narrative, they are used to unlock the door of the house where the group believes the missing boxes of earth from Count Dracula's tomb are hidden. The keys are kept in Dr. Seward's pocket. The group's startling reaction when entering the room is due to its similarity to the image described in Dr. Seward's diary of opening Miss Westenra's tomb. This connection triggers a sense of dread and eeriness, reminding them of their previous encounters with the supernatural."/>

It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo&#10;of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal&#10;with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and&#10;brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must&#10;stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:&#10;give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes.

He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which&#10;might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried&#10;out. To use an Americanism, he had &quot;taken no chances,&quot; and the absolute&#10;accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the&#10;logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:&#10;&quot;Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.&quot;&#10;Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of&#10;these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could&#10;give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs&#10;officers and the harbour-master.

<node id=" To ensure the man's (Renfield's) desperate plea for release is granted, you could take the following steps:&#10;&#10;1. Evaluate his current state: Observe Renfield's behavior, demeanor, and arguments for sanity in the morning as you had planned. Consider whether his understanding of his situation and his plea for release appear genuine and grounded in reality.&#10;&#10;2. Consult with others: Involve the other individuals present during the conversation (Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, and Jonathan Harker) in the decision-making process. Their observations and perspectives might provide additional insight into Renfield's mental state.&#10;&#10;3. Review records: Examine Renfield's medical history, previous outbursts, and any patterns related to the presence of the Count. Consider whether Renfield's current contentment could be a result of the vampire's influence or his own zooephagous instincts.&#10;&#10;4. Seek professional advice: If there is any doubt about Renfield's sanity, consult with other medical professionals or psychiatrists for a second opinion.&#10;&#10;5. Consider the risks: Weigh the potential risks of releasing Renfield against the benefits. If you believe he is genuinely sane and poses no threat to himself or others, it might be appropriate to grant his release.&#10;&#10;6. Implement precautions: If you decide to release Renfield, ensure that he is accompanied by keepers or guards, as he requested, and that he is restrained if necessary. This will help mitigate any potential risks associated with his release.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor his progress: After releasing Renfield, continue to monitor his mental state and behavior to ensure that he remains safe and that his release was the right decision."/>

<node id=" When the lunatic, Thomas Snelling, made the statement about his past belief in consuming live things, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room. This observation made by Dr. John Seward is noted by Van Helsing, who finds it fascinating in the context of his study of mental disease. He believes that there is much to be learned from the &quot;folly&quot; of such lunatics, possibly more than from the teachings of the wisest men. This situation highlights the complexities of mental illness and the unpredictable nature of the lunatic's mental state, as Snelling appeared coherent and reasonable despite having just eaten flies and spiders."/>

Then Mr. Morris said&#10;to Dr. Seward:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the&#10;sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some&#10;serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a&#10;chance.&quot; Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,&#10;for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last&#10;hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in&#10;our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.&#10;All is best as they are.&quot; Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a&#10;dreamy kind of way:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an&#10;ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he&#10;seems so mixed up with the Count"/>
<node id="Who knows?&quot; I went on with my work, and before long was through that in&#10;hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was&#10;Van Helsing back in the study. &quot;Do I interrupt?&quot; he asked politely as he&#10;stood at the door.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all,&quot; I answered. &quot;Come in.

Our interview was short.&#10;When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with&#10;his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen&#10;discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a&#10;measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. &quot;Don't&#10;you know me?&quot; I asked. His answer was not reassuring: &quot;I know you well&#10;enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself&#10;and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else.

<node id=" Based on the events of this night, the group's first step in their planned course of action was successful and safe for them. They were able to search the house, find nothing but dust, and confirm the number of missing boxes without any harm coming to them. This step was also successful in keeping Mina safe from the horrors of their investigation, as she was not involved or troubled in any way. The condition of the dogs further supports the idea that there were no supernatural or evil presences in the house that could have harmed the group.&#10;&#10;The group's ability to carry out this step without Mina's knowledge or involvement is significant, as it means that she was protected from the disturbing and dangerous nature of their investigation. This is important for her emotional and mental well-being, as she is already dealing with the sadness and low-spiritedness caused by her anxiety, the recent tragic events, and her feelings of guilt and regret.&#10;&#10;Overall, the group can learn that their planned course of action has the potential to be successful and safe, as long as they continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of Mina and work together to achieve their goals."/>
<node id=" When Mr. Renfield said he hoped to see Mrs. Harker again, he was expecting to see the girl that Dr. Seward wanted to marry, as he thought she was dead. This response was surprising to the reader because it shows that Renfield has some knowledge of Dr. Seward's personal life and his interest in Mina, which he obtained through overhearing conversations or observations. However, his assumption that she was dead and his mention of it in such a casual way is quite chilling and reveals his disconnection from reality."/>

She also notes that the fog is coming in through the joinings of the door, forming a pillar of cloud in the room.

I think that it took me an effort and a&#10;little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was&#10;bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of&#10;the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.&#10;&#10;I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I&#10;was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my&#10;hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the&#10;usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn&#10;upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the&#10;clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim&#10;around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,&#10;came only like a tiny red spark through"/>

Things&#10;began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now&#10;whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words &quot;a&#10;pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.&quot; Was it indeed some such&#10;spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was&#10;composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the&#10;red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I&#10;looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like&#10;two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering&#10;when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's&#10;Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan&#10;had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist&#10;in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became&#10;black darkness.

The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,&#10;came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently&#10;grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I&#10;had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to&#10;make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my&#10;limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed&#10;my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what&#10;tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The&#10;mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I&#10;could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling&#10;water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of&#10;the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became&#10;concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top&#10;of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things&#10;began to whirl through my brain"/>
<node id=" The dim, foggy conditions in the room are likely a manifestation of Mina Harker's emotional state, symbolizing the weight of her burdens and anxieties. The dream narrative mentions that the heavy, dank, and cold air in the room may symbolize her emotional state. Furthermore, her feet, hands, and brain feeling heavy and unable to act could represent her powerlessness and inability to take action in the situation. It is also possible that the fog is coming in through the joinings of the door, forming a pillar of cloud in the room, but this is less likely the primary cause, as the narrative focuses more on Mina's emotional state as the origin of the dim and foggy conditions."/>
<node id=" The man, who is Lord Godalming, expressed his gratitude to the speaker, Mrs. Harker (Mina), by saying that her sweet sympathy has been a great help to him in his time of sorrow. He acknowledges that he is not ungrateful at the moment, but his gratitude will grow with his understanding in time. He asks Mrs. Harker to be like a sister to him for all their lives, for dear Lucy's sake. Mrs. Harker agrees to his request and promises to be like a sister to him, for Lucy's sake as well as for his own sake, as she knows how much he suffered and how much Lucy meant to him."/>
<node id=" no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for&#10;days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been&#10;unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of&#10;sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with&#10;whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was&#10;surrounded, he could speak freely. &quot;I know now how I suffered,&quot; he said,&#10;as he dried his eyes, &quot;but I do not know even yet--and none other can&#10;ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall&#10;know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful&#10;now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be&#10;like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For dear Lucy's sake,&quot; I said as we clasped hands. &quot;Ay, and for your&#10;own sake,&quot; he added, &quot;for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth&#10;the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring&#10;to you a time"/>
<node id="; for when&#10;Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and&#10;gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I&#10;hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it&#10;afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I&#10;_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I&#10;could see that his heart was breaking:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to&#10;her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let&#10;me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have&#10;had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can&#10;help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for&#10;Lucy's sake?&quot;&#10;&#10;In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed&#10;to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a&#10;vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his"/>

I feared, oh so&#10;much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I&#10;saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so&#10;strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for&#10;itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.&#10;&#10;When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I&#10;in his; there was no need for speaking between us.&#10;&#10;&quot;I answer for Mina and myself,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Count me in, Professor,&quot; said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am with you,&quot; said Lord Godalming, &quot;for Lucy's sake, if for no other&#10;reason.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his&#10;golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took&#10;his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with&#10;his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our&#10;solemn compact was made.

He&#10;brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He&#10;placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I&#10;could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case&#10;I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his&#10;back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read.

<node id=" The man, referred to as Renfield, once held a strange belief that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, he could indefinitely prolong his life. This belief led him to attempt taking human life, as he believed that he could strengthen his vital powers by assimilating the life of another through their blood, in accordance with the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is the life.'&#10;&#10;This example illustrates his previous sanity and current reasonableness in several ways. First, Renfield himself acknowledges the peculiarity of his past belief and the concern it caused among his friends, indicating an understanding of the social norms and expectations of rational behavior. Second, he can discuss this topic with impartiality and relative detachment, demonstrating a clear separation between his past and present mental states. Furthermore, he uses his own experience as an example to support a broader point, showcasing his ability to reason and communicate coherently. These factors contribute to the impression that Renfield is currently reasonable, despite his history of delusional behavior."/>
<node id=" At the meeting, the group decided to join Professor Van Helsing in his plan to battle their mysterious enemy, which they believe to be vampires. They formed a committee with Van Helsing as the head, and Mina Harker acting as the secretary. Each member of the committee, including Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Jonathan Harker, and Mr. Morris, agreed to contribute their skills and resources to the cause. They also decided to share all information and facts related to the case, which they had previously gathered and documented, in order to develop an effective plan of action. The group's solemn compact to work together in their dangerous endeavor indicates their commitment and determination to defeat the vampires."/>
<node id=" Dr. Seward is refusing to share details about Lucy's death from his diary because he realizes that his diary is not easily searchable, and it would be difficult to share only certain parts of it. He is also concerned about protecting Mina from the horror of Lucy's death. He mentions that he doesn't know how to &quot;pick out any particular part of the diary&quot; and that the idea of sharing the details never occurred to him until Mina brought it up. Dr. Seward is also aware that his diary contains sensitive information about his cases, and he is hesitant to reveal such personal and potentially disturbing details to others. Additionally, Dr. Seward is also concerned about the &quot;terrible story&quot; of Lucy's death and the larger context of the &quot;dark mystery&quot; they are trying to solve, and he is unsure if sharing this information is the right decision."/>
<node id=" Mr. Renfield mistakenly thinks that Mrs. Harker is a girl that Dr. Seward wanted to marry. The significant event he mentions about this person is that she is dead."/>
<node id=" Based on the condition of the place and the group's behavior during the search, we can infer that the surroundings were grim, thick with dust, and filled with a loathsome and nauseous smell. The intense odor, described as a combination of all the ills of mortality and an intensified loathsomeness due to corruption, suggests that the place was associated with death and decay. Despite the physical considerations, the group persevered in their search due to their high and terrible purpose, indicating their strong motivation and determination.&#10;&#10;The group's behavior during the search also reveals their feelings of unease and discomfort. They all experienced a feeling of there being someone else amongst them, possibly due to the recollection of a previous terrifying experience in Transylvania. This suggests that the group was on edge and hyper-vigilant throughout the search. The fact that they kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and new shadow indicates that they were anxious and fearful of their surroundings, further emphasizing the grim and threatening nature of the place."/>
<node id=" The speaker, Professor Van Helsing, is content after the group's first night's work because they were able to search the house, find nothing supernatural, and confirm the number of missing boxes without any harm coming to them. This successful and safe completion of their planned course of action has given them confidence to continue with their future work.&#10;&#10;To ensure Mina's safety and well-being, the group has made sure that she was not involved or troubled by their investigation. They have prioritized her emotional and mental well-being, as she is already dealing with anxiety, sadness, and feelings of guilt and regret due to recent tragic events. By keeping her unaware of their investigative work and their deliberations, they aim to protect her from further emotional distress. The group recognizes that the nature of their work is dangerous and perilous, and they believe it is too great a burden for a woman to bear."/>

It may be&#10;ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;&#10;but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.&quot;&#10;&#10;The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who&#10;was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound&#10;from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,&#10;after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.&#10;&#10;I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so&#10;softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it.

This is a significant achievement as it means that Mina was kept safe from the horrors of their investigation, at least for the time being.&#10;&#10;The condition of the dogs also supports the idea that the group's first step was a success. At no point did the dogs exhibit any signs of unease or discomfort during their search of the house. In fact, when they returned to the chapel, the dogs frisked about as if they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood. This suggests that there were no supernatural or evil presences in the house that could have harmed the dogs or the group.&#10;&#10;Overall, the results of the group's search of the house and the condition of the dogs indicate that their first step in their plan was a success and that Mina was kept safe from harm. However, the group acknowledges that there are still other dangers and fears to contend with, and they will need to remain vigilant in their pursuit of Dracula." target=" Based on the condition of the place and the group's behavior during the search, we can infer that the surroundings were grim, thick with dust, and filled with a loathsome and nauseous smell. The intense odor, described as a combination of all the ills of mortality and an intensified loathsomeness due to corruption, suggests that the place was associated with death and decay. Despite the physical considerations, the group persevered in their search due to their high and terrible purpose, indicating their strong motivation and determination.&#10;&#10;The group's behavior during the search also reveals their feelings of unease and discomfort. They all experienced a feeling of there being someone else amongst them, possibly due to the recollection of a previous terrifying experience in Transylvania. This suggests that the group was on edge and hyper-vigilant throughout the search. The fact that they kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and new shadow indicates that they were anxious and fearful of their surroundings, further emphasizing the grim and threatening nature of the place.">

Obliquity of thought and memory: Van Helsing finds it fascinating to study Snelling's mental disease, as his folly might provide valuable insights, which could be more enlightening than teachings from the wisest men.&#10;&#10;2. Snelling's mental state: Snelling displays a higher level of understanding and rationality, unlike any other lunatic.

After going over the adventure of the&#10;night he suddenly said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him&#10;this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may&#10;be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,&#10;and reason so sound.&quot; I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him&#10;that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to&#10;keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary&#10;instructions.

Evaluate his current state: Observe Renfield's behavior, demeanor, and arguments for sanity in the morning as you had planned. Consider whether his understanding of his situation and his plea for release appear genuine and grounded in reality.&#10;&#10;2. Consult with others: Involve the other individuals present during the conversation (Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, and Jonathan Harker) in the decision-making process. Their observations and perspectives might provide additional insight into Renfield's mental state.&#10;&#10;3. Review records: Examine Renfield's medical history, previous outbursts, and any patterns related to the presence of the Count. Consider whether Renfield's current contentment could be a result of the vampire's influence or his own zooephagous instincts.&#10;&#10;4. Seek professional advice: If there is any doubt about Renfield's sanity, consult with other medical professionals or psychiatrists for a second opinion.&#10;&#10;5. Consider the risks: Weigh the potential risks of releasing Renfield against the benefits. If you believe he is genuinely sane and poses no threat to himself or others, it might be appropriate to grant his release.&#10;&#10;6. Implement precautions: If you decide to release Renfield, ensure that he is accompanied by keepers or guards, as he requested, and that he is restrained if necessary. This will help mitigate any potential risks associated with his release.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor his progress: After releasing Renfield, continue to monitor his mental state and behavior to ensure that he remains safe and that his release was the right decision.">

Their observations and perspectives might provide additional insight into Renfield's mental state.&#10;&#10;3. Review records: Examine Renfield's medical history, previous outbursts, and any patterns related to the presence of the Count. Consider whether Renfield's current contentment could be a result of the vampire's influence or his own zooephagous instincts.&#10;&#10;4. Seek professional advice: If there is any doubt about Renfield's sanity, consult with other medical professionals or psychiatrists for a second opinion.&#10;&#10;5. Consider the risks: Weigh the potential risks of releasing Renfield against the benefits. If you believe he is genuinely sane and poses no threat to himself or others, it might be appropriate to grant his release.&#10;&#10;6. Implement precautions: If you decide to release Renfield, ensure that he is accompanied by keepers or guards, as he requested, and that he is restrained if necessary. This will help mitigate any potential risks associated with his release.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor his progress: After releasing Renfield, continue to monitor his mental state and behavior to ensure that he remains safe and that his release was the right decision.">

Evaluate his current state: Observe Renfield's behavior, demeanor, and arguments for sanity in the morning as you had planned. Consider whether his understanding of his situation and his plea for release appear genuine and grounded in reality.&#10;&#10;2. Consult with others: Involve the other individuals present during the conversation (Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, and Jonathan Harker) in the decision-making process.

Review records: Examine Renfield's medical history, previous outbursts, and any patterns related to the presence of the Count. Consider whether Renfield's current contentment could be a result of the vampire's influence or his own zooephagous instincts.&#10;&#10;4. Seek professional advice: If there is any doubt about Renfield's sanity, consult with other medical professionals or psychiatrists for a second opinion.&#10;&#10;5. Consider the risks: Weigh the potential risks of releasing Renfield against the benefits. If you believe he is genuinely sane and poses no threat to himself or others, it might be appropriate to grant his release.&#10;&#10;6. Implement precautions: If you decide to release Renfield, ensure that he is accompanied by keepers or guards, as he requested, and that he is restrained if necessary. This will help mitigate any potential risks associated with his release.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor his progress: After releasing Renfield, continue to monitor his mental state and behavior to ensure that he remains safe and that his release was the right decision.">

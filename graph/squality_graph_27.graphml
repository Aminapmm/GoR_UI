    <node id="The speaker is interviewing alien applicants for the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science on the planet Ghryne, which is located in the Caledonia Cluster. They are looking to add new and diverse intelligent life-forms to their show, with the goal of having at least one member of at least 500 different races. The applicants mentioned include ursinoids from Aldebaran IX, blue-skinned humanoids from Donovan's Planet, a Sirian spider, a vegetable from Miazan, and a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds. The speaker is selective about who they hire, taking into account the needs and costs associated with each species." />
    <node id=" applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet, four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at anything short of top rate.&#10; &#10; Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a handout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supply of, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even get the handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging.&#10; &#10; The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we" />
    <node id=" only one way he can do it.&#10; &#10; We don't keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens before this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms. My goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I reach that, I'll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can.&#10; &#10; After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new specimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids, fifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no less than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks.&#10; &#10; It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a Ghrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some&#10;400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn't see how we could take one on. They're gentle and likable beings, but their upkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any old kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan.&#10; &#10; &quot;One more specimen before lunch,&quot; I told St" />

The Galaxy is full of bizarre beings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the old exhibitionist urge.&#10; &#10; &quot;Send them in one at a time,&quot; I told Stebbins. I ducked into the office, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to begin.&#10; &#10; The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the official Terran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people were accustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV and referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals happy wherever I go.&#10; &#10; Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim sign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS! We had saturated MacTavish IV with our promotional poop for a month preceding arrival. Stuff like this:&#10;  Want to visit Earth—see the Galaxy's most glittering and exclusive world?

I will see Earth at last! I accept the terms!&quot;&#10; &#10; I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into the other office to sign him up.&#10; &#10; I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show; the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him didn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get to Earth. My conscience won't let me really exploit a being, but I don't believe in throwing money away, either.&#10; &#10; The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX.

And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan, and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds. Hardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him officially.&#10; &#10; He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high, and getting on toward a ton.

A few driblets of bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.&#10; &#10; Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the green sashes of the local police force.

We had figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into the successful proprietor of Corrigan's Institute, after some years as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in&#10;2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement.&#10; &#10; Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down, a non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a scientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo.&#10; &#10; That's what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is, of course. A zoo. But we don't go out and hunt for our specimens; we advertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth once in his lifetime, and there's only one way he can do it.&#10; &#10; We don't keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens before this trip" />
    <node id="The Stortulian attempted to kill himself because he was overwhelmed by troubles and believed that killing the person who caused his trouble (in this case, Corrigan) was the solution. This is a part of Stortulian psychology, as explained by Ildwar Gorb.&#10;&#10;Ildwar Gorb prevented it from happening by tackling Corrigan just in time, knocking him out of the way before the Stortulian could fire his blaster. Gorb did this because he realized that the Stortulian was not actually suicidal but was intending to kill Corrigan instead." />
    <node id=", if I did come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against crackpots.&#10; &#10; In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, &quot;Life is no longer worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me to do.&quot;&#10; &#10; I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers going down the drain. &quot;Stop him, somebody! He's going to kill himself! He's—&quot;&#10; &#10; Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I guess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on.&#10; &#10; Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian.

He was out to get you.&quot;&#10; &#10; I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.&#10; &#10; &quot;Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian psychology, Corrigan,&quot; Gorb said lightly. &quot;Suicide is completely abhorrent to them. When they're troubled, they kill the person who caused their trouble. In this case, you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; I began to chuckle—more of a tension-relieving snicker than a full-bodied laugh.&#10; &#10; &quot;Funny,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What is?&quot; asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.&#10; &#10; &quot;These aliens.

I do have some conscience, and I had the uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to commit suicide on my account.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; About fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life started to get complicated again.&#10; &#10; Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.&#10; &#10; I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian's outraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door opened and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII stepped in.&#10;" />

If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was going to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000 per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.&#10; &#10; I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced arrival.&#10; &#10; The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a moment and turned to eye the newcomer.&#10; &#10; I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne.

    <node id="The Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is an institute on Earth that serves as a zoo for alien specimens. It became successful as a result of the isolationist policies of the late 29th century, when non-terrestrial beings were no longer allowed to visit Earth. The only way they could now get onto Sol III was as exhibits in a scientific collection, or in other words, as an exhibit in a zoo. This led to a high demand among aliens to visit Earth once in their lifetime and the Corrigan Institute capitalized on this by advertising itself as a place where aliens could work as exhibits and get a chance to travel to Earth. The institute does not capture its specimens, instead they advertise and the aliens come flocking to them. This business model has proved to be successful for J.F Corrigan, the proprietor of the institute." />

The protagonist, Corrigan, suspects this and believes there is no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there's only one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. Furthermore, the individual's ability to speak English fluently and their attempt to persuade Corrigan with their supposed alien characteristics suggest that they are not actually an alien. Additionally, Corrigan notes that the individual is &quot;glib and appealing&quot; and spins a &quot;good yarn,&quot; further supporting the idea that they are a human con artist.">

It became successful as a result of the isolationist policies of the late 29th century, when non-terrestrial beings were no longer allowed to visit Earth. The only way they could now get onto Sol III was as exhibits in a scientific collection, or in other words, as an exhibit in a zoo. This led to a high demand among aliens to visit Earth once in their lifetime and the Corrigan Institute capitalized on this by advertising itself as a place where aliens could work as exhibits and get a chance to travel to Earth. The institute does not capture its specimens, instead they advertise and the aliens come flocking to them. This business model has proved to be successful for J.F Corrigan, the proprietor of the institute.">

This encounter occurs in the context of the narrator processing over two dozen new life-forms into contracts. The being appears to be an Earthman, but insists that he is from Wazzenazz XIII, a planet in the Crab Nebula with an Earthlike race. Despite the being's insistence, the narrator is skeptical and dismissive of his claims.&#10;&#10;This interaction relates to the successful processing of over two dozen new life-forms into contracts because it highlights the challenges and complexities of interspecies communication and understanding. The being who introduces himself as Ildwar Gorb is one of many life-forms that the narrator encounters during the recruitment process, and the narrator's response to him reflects his frustration and weariness at dealing with such a diverse range of beings. Additionally, the being's insistence on being recognized as an alien life-form, despite appearing to be an Earthman, underscores the importance of cultural competence and sensitivity in interspecies communication, which is crucial for successful recruitment and collaboration in a scientific institute that values diversity and inclusivity.">

This interaction underscored the importance of cultural competence and sensitivity in interspecies communication, as the being's insistence on being recognized as an alien life-form was crucial for successful recruitment and collaboration in a scientific institute that values diversity and inclusivity.&#10;&#10;The being's tearful demeanor and the narrator's uneasy feeling that he might be contemplating suicide added to the emotional complexity of the encounter. The fact that the being was one of over two dozen new life-forms being processed into contracts further emphasized the challenges faced by the narrator during the recruitment process.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the being's claims to be a telepath and his ability to speak English fluently suggested that he might have been an out-of-cash human stranded on Earth disguising themselves as an alien.

Furthermore, he suggests that if the alien had not revealed the truth about his motives and simply asked him to sign up, he might have considered it, emphasizing his adherence to honesty and fairness in his dealings." target="The accusation being made against the Earthman is that his unethical actions have directly contributed to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form, specifically the Kallerian who committed suicide in his office. The Ghrynian policemen argue that the Earthman's refusal to yield to the Kallerian's request lies at the root of his sad demise and is a direct violation of the law.&#10;&#10;The Earthman's response, according to the Ghrynian policemen, is initially one of disbelief and anger. He argues that he should not be held responsible for any being who guts themselves on his carpet, insisting that this is the law. When pressed by the policemen, he fails to deny the accusation, which they interpret as an admission of guilt.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the Earthman expresses frustration at the idea that he may be subject to a fine of $100,000 Galactic or two years in prison for each suicide, suggesting that this could put him out of business by nightfall. He also laments the fact that he may have to resolve never to come on recruiting trips to Ghryne again and figure out a more effective way of screening himself against crackpots.">

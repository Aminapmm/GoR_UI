    <node id="Judith called for her companions to stop rowing because she had completely lost sight of Hetty's canoe. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to detect the position of the canoe through sound or sight. They were in a situation where they needed to use their senses carefully to try and find the canoe. Judith was listening for any sound that might betray the direction in which her sister was stealing away, while her two companions brought their eyes near to the water level to detect any object floating on its surface." />
    <node id=" time was to&#10;be lost, lest it should altogether disappear. The rifles were now laid&#10;aside as useless, the two men seizing the oars and sweeping the head of&#10;the scow round in the direction of the canoe. Judith, accustomed to the&#10;office, flew to the other end of the Ark, and placed herself at what&#10;might be called the helm. Hetty took the alarm at these preparations,&#10;which could not be made without noise, and started off like a bird that&#10;had been suddenly put up by the approach of unexpected danger.&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer and his companion rowed with the energy of those who&#10;felt the necessity of straining every nerve, and Hetty's strength was&#10;impaired by a nervous desire to escape, the chase would have quickly&#10;terminated in the capture of the fugitive, had not the girl made several&#10;short and unlooked-for deviations in her course. These turnings gave her&#10;time, and they had also the effect of gradually bringing both canoe and&#10;Ark within the deeper gloom, cast by the shadows from the hills. They&#10;also gradually increased the distance between the fugitive and her&#10;pursuers, until Judith called out to her companions to cease" />

Hetty stopped paddling at the same&#10;moment, and waited the result with an impatience that was breathless,&#10;equally from her late exertions, and her desire to land. A dead silence&#10;immediately fell on the lake, during which the three in the Ark were&#10;using their senses differently, in order to detect the position of the&#10;canoe. Judith bent forward to listen, in the hope of catching some sound&#10;that might betray the direction in which her sister was stealing away,&#10;while her two companions brought their eyes as near as possible to&#10;a level with the water, in order to detect any object that might be&#10;floating on its surface.

She loves her father more than most children love&#10;their parents--and--then--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, what, gal? This is a trying moment; one in which truth must be&#10;spoken!&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith felt a generous and womanly regret at betraying her sister, and&#10;she hesitated ere she spoke again. But once more urged by Deerslayer,&#10;and conscious herself of all the risks the whole party was running by&#10;the indiscretion of Hetty, she could refrain no longer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, I fear, poor, weak-minded Hetty has not been" />

We have got embayed here, and&#10;needs keep the mast clear of the trees. Judith, there's a canoe!&quot;&#10;&#10;The last words were uttered with great earnestness, and Deerslayer's&#10;hand was on his rifle ere they were fairly out of his mouth. But the&#10;truth flashed on the mind of the quick-witted girl, and she instantly&#10;told her companion that the boat must be that in which her sister had&#10;fled.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep the scow straight, Delaware; steer as straight as your bullet&#10;flies when sent ag'in a buck; there--I have it.&quot;&#10;&#10;The canoe was seized, and immediately secured again to the side of the&#10;Ark. At the next moment the sail was lowered, and the motion of the Ark&#10;arrested by means of the oars.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hetty!&quot; called out Judith, concern, even affection betraying itself in&#10;her tones. &quot;Are you within hearing, sister--for God's sake answer, and&#10;let me hear the sound of your voice, again!

While in the act of pushing it from her, she heard low&#10;voices that seemed to come among the trees behind her. Startled at this&#10;unexpected danger Hetty was on the point of springing into the canoe&#10;in order to seek safety in flight, when she thought she recognized the&#10;tones of Judith's melodious voice. Bending forward so as to catch the&#10;sounds more directly, they evidently came from the water, and then she&#10;understood that the Ark was approaching from the south, and so close&#10;in with the western shore, as necessarily to cause it to pass the point&#10;within twenty yards of the spot where she stood. Here, then, was all she&#10;could desire; the canoe was shoved off into the lake, leaving its late&#10;occupant alone on the narrow strand.&#10;&#10;When this act of self-devotion was performed, Hetty did not retire. The&#10;foliage of the overhanging trees and bushes would have almost concealed&#10;her person, had there been light, but in that obscurity it was utterly&#10;impossible to discover any object thus sh" />

Go your way, Deerslayer,&#10;and let me go mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hetty!&quot; exclaimed the young man and Judith in a breath; and the former&#10;sprang instantly to the spot where he had left the canoe they had been&#10;towing. It was gone, and he understood the whole affair. As for the&#10;fugitive, frightened at the menace she ceased paddling, and remained&#10;dimly visible, resembling a spectral outline of a human form, standing&#10;on the water. At the next moment the sail was lowered, to prevent the&#10;Ark from passing the spot where the canoe lay. This last expedient,&#10;however, was not taken in time, for the momentum of so heavy a craft,&#10;and the impulsion of the air, soon set her by, bringing" />

Nor was this altogether the result of a desire to escape,&#10;for, feeble minded as she was, Hetty Hutter had a good deal of that&#10;instinctive caution which so often keeps those whom God has thus visited&#10;from harm. She was perfectly aware of the importance of keeping the&#10;canoes from falling into the hands of the Iroquois, and long familiarity&#10;with the lake had suggested one of the simplest expedients, by which&#10;this great object could be rendered compatible with her own purpose.&#10;&#10;The point in question was the first projection that offered on that side&#10;of the lake, where a canoe, if set adrift with a southerly air would&#10;float clear of the land, and where it would be no great violation of&#10;probabilities to suppose it might even hit the castle; the latter lying&#10;above it, almost in a direct line with the wind. Such then was Hetty's&#10;intention, and she landed on the extremity of the gravelly point,&#10;beneath an overhanging oak, with the express intention of shoving the&#10;canoe off from the shore, in order that it" />

She knew, too, from the logs that occasionally&#10;floated about the lake, that did it miss the castle and its appendages&#10;the wind would be likely to change before the canoe could reach the&#10;northern extremity of the lake, and that Deerslayer might have an&#10;opportunity of regaining it in the morning, when no doubt he would be&#10;earnestly sweeping the surface of the water, and the whole of its wooded&#10;shores, with glass. In all this, too, Hetty was less governed by any&#10;chain of reasoning than by her habits, the latter often supplying the&#10;place of mind, in human beings, as they perform the same for animals of&#10;the inferior classes.&#10;&#10;The girl was quite an hour finding her way to the point, the distance&#10;and the obscurity equally detaining her, but she was no sooner on the&#10;gravelly beach than she prepared to set the canoe adrift, in the manner&#10;mentioned.

In order to avoid her pursuers, however, who, she rightly&#10;suspected, would soon be rowing along that shore themselves, the head&#10;of the canoe was pointed so far north as to bring her to land on a point&#10;that thrust itself into the lake, at the distance of near a league from&#10;the outlet.

She talks of him in her&#10;sleep, and sometimes betrays the inclination in her waking moments.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You think, Judith, that your sister is now bent on some mad scheme to&#10;serve her father and Hurry, which will, in all likelihood, give them&#10;riptyles the Mingos, the mastership of a canoe?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Such, I fear, will turn out to be the fact, Deerslayer. Poor Hetty has&#10;hardly sufficient cunning to outwit a savage.&quot;&#10;&#10;All this while the canoe, with the form of Hetty erect in one end of it,&#10;was dimly perceptible, though the greater drift of the Ark rendered it,&#10;at each instant, less and less distinct.

You&#10;can do nothing in the dark; will lose your way in the forest, and perish&#10;for want of food.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;God will not let that happen to a poor child that goes to serve her&#10;father, sister.

Governor no tell&#10;difference. Wicked t'ing for pale-face to scalp. No his gifts, as the&#10;good Deerslayer always tell me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And do you know the Deerslayer?&quot; said Hetty, coloring with delight and&#10;surprise; forgetting her regrets, at the moment, in the influence of&#10;this new feeling. &quot;I know him, too. He is now in the Ark, with Judith&#10;and a Delaware who is called the Big Serpent. A bold and handsome&#10;warrior is this Serpent, too!&quot;&#10;&#10;Spite of the rich deep colour that nature had bestowed on the Indian&#10;beauty, the tell-tale blood deepened on her cheeks, until the blush gave&#10;new animation and intelligence to her jet-black eyes.

    <node id="Hetty Hutter pushed the canoe off from the shore into the lake with the intention of it drifting towards her father's house, mainly due to her habits and instincts rather than reasoning. She was motivated by her love for her father and wanted to ensure that the canoe did not fall into the hands of their enemies, the Iroquois. Hetty was aware of the importance of keeping the canoes from the enemy and came up with a simple plan to achieve this while also fulfilling her own purpose. She landed on a gravelly point beneath an overhanging oak and pushed the canoe off from the shore, hoping that it would hit her father's house if currents carried it in that direction. However, she knew that the wind might cause the canoe to change direction before reaching the northern extremity of the lake, giving Deerslayer a chance to recover it in the morning." />

Having reached a point at no great&#10;distance from the shore, and where the obscurity was intense on account&#10;of the proximity of the land, it lay there near an hour, in waiting for&#10;the expected approach of Hetty, who, it was thought, would make the best&#10;of her way to that spot as soon as she believed herself released&#10;from the danger of pursuit. No success rewarded this little blockade,&#10;however, neither appearance nor sound denoting the passage of the canoe.&#10;Disappointed at this failure, and conscious of the importance of getting&#10;possession of the fortress before it could be seized by the enemy,&#10;Deerslayer now took his way towards the castle, with the apprehension&#10;that all his foresight in securing the canoes would be defeated by this&#10;unguarded and alarming movement on the part of the feeble-minded Hetty.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;But who in this wild wood&#10;    May credit give to either eye, or ear?&#10;    From rocky precipice or hollow cave,&#10;    'Midst the confused sound of rustling leaves" />
    <node id="Hetty and Wah-ta-Wah have different views regarding the taking of scalps in war and the possibility of forgiveness for such actions. Hetty believes that God will not forgive murder and thefts, including the taking of scalps, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a red man or a white man. She thinks that if Wah-ta-Wah's father, Chingachgook, has many scalps, his sleep at night must be terrible, as no one can be cruel and hope to be forgiven.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Wah-ta-Wah believes that the Manitou, their god, smiles and is pleased when young warriors come back from the war path with scalps. She thinks that it is an honorable thing for her people to take scalps, and Chingachgook can take as many scalps as he can carry himself. Wah-ta-Wah also believes that one gift is to talk, and another gift is to hold one's tongue. Therefore, she advises Hetty not to make any allusion to the presence of Chingachgook or the motive of his visit to the lake.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty views the taking of scalps as a cruel act that cannot be forgiven, while Wah-ta-Wah sees it as an honorable tradition that brings pleasure to their god." />

I no Mingo--good Delaware--Yengeese friend. Mingo cruel,&#10;and love scalp, for blood--Delaware love him, for honor. Come here,&#10;where no eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Wah-ta-Wah now led her companion towards the lake, descending the bank&#10;so as to place its overhanging trees and bushes between them and any&#10;probable observers. Nor did she stop until they" />

God&#10;will not pardon in a red man, what he will not pardon in a white man.&#10;&#10;&quot;No true--&quot; returned the Delaware girl, with a warmth that nearly&#10;amounted to passion. &quot;No true, I tell you! The Manitou smile and pleased&#10;when he see young warrior come back from the war path, with two, ten,&#10;hundred scalp on a pole! Chingachgook father take scalp--grandfather&#10;take scalp--all old chief take scalp, and Chingachgook take as many&#10;scalp as he can carry, himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, Hist, his sleep of nights must be terrible to think of. No one&#10;can be cruel, and hope to be forgiven.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No cruel--plenty forgiven--&quot; returned Wah-ta-Wah, stamping her little&#10;foot on the stony strand, and shaking her head in a way to show how&#10;completely feminine feeling, in one of its aspects, had gotten the&#10;better of feminine feeling in another" />

No need to spell name at&#10;all--Moravian try to make Wah-ta-Wah spell, but no won't let him. No&#10;good for Delaware girl to know too much--know more than warrior some&#10;time; that great shame. My name Wah-ta-Wah that say Hist in your tongue;&#10;you call him, Hist--I call him, Hetty.&quot;&#10;&#10;These preliminaries settled to their mutual satisfaction, the two girls&#10;began to discourse of their several hopes and projects. Hetty made her&#10;new friend more fully acquainted with her intentions in behalf of her&#10;father, and, to one in the least addicted to prying into the affairs,&#10;Hist would have betrayed her own feelings and expectations in connection" />

Chingachgook exhibits caution and restraint in asking questions about his surroundings because it is a common characteristic among Indians to avoid betraying womanish curiosity by asking questions.

Although Chingachgook both understood and spoke English, he was&#10;unwilling to communicate his thoughts in it, like most Indians, and&#10;when he had met Judith's cordial shake of the hand, and Hetty's milder&#10;salute, in the courteous manner that became a chief, he turned away,&#10;apparently to await the moment when it might suit his friend to enter&#10;into an explanation of his future intentions" />

As the floating house&#10;now lay several hundred feet from the shore, and offered a complete&#10;protection against bullets, there was no longer any danger or any motive&#10;for immediate exertion.&#10;&#10;The manner in which the two friends now recognized each other, was&#10;highly characteristic. Chingachgook, a noble, tall, handsome and&#10;athletic young Indian warrior, first examined his rifle with care,&#10;opening the pan to make sure that the priming was not wet, and, assured&#10;of this important fact, he next cast furtive but observant glances&#10;around him, at the strange habitation and at the two girls. Still he&#10;spoke not, and most of all did he avoid the betrayal of a womanish&#10;curiosity, by asking questions.&#10;&#10;&quot;Judith and Hetty&quot; said Deerslayer, with an untaught, natural&#10;courtesy--&quot;this is the Mohican chief of whom you've heard me speak;&#10;Chingachgook as he is called; which signifies Big Sarpent; so named for&#10;his wisdom and prudence," />

An old man, and a young warrior--the&#10;falling hemlock and the tall pine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You're not so much out, Delaware; you're not so much out. Old Hutter is&#10;decaying, of a sartainty, though many solid blocks might be hewn out of&#10;his trunk yet, and, as for Hurry Harry, so far as height and strength&#10;and comeliness go, he may be called the pride of the human forest. Were&#10;the men bound, or in any manner suffering torture? I ask on account of&#10;the young women, who, I dare to say, would be glad to know.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not so, Deerslayer. The Mingos are too many to cage their game.&#10;Some watch; some sleep; some scout; some hunt. The pale-faces are&#10;treated like brothers to-day; to-morrow they will lose their scalps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, that's red natur', and must be submitted to! Judith and Hetty,&#10;here's" />

The great question was,&#10;whether, surrounded by enemies as he was known to be, he had escaped&#10;their toils. The occurrences of the last twenty-four hours must be a&#10;secret to him, and like himself, Chingachgook was yet young on a path.&#10;It was true, he came prepared to encounter the party that withheld&#10;his promised bride, but he had no means ascertaining the extent of the&#10;danger he ran, or the precise positions occupied by either friends, or&#10;foes. In a word, the trained sagacity, and untiring caution of an Indian&#10;were all he had to rely on, amid the critical risks he unavoidably ran.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is the rock empty, Judith?&quot; inquired Deerslayer, as soon as he&#10;had checked the drift of the Ark, deeming it imprudent to venture&#10;unnecessarily near the shore. &quot;Is any thing to be seen of the Delaware&#10;chief?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing, Deerslayer.

At that moment the door of the cabin was opened hastily, and,&#10;a warrior, darting through the little room, stood at Deerslayer's side,&#10;simply uttering the exclamation &quot;Hugh!&quot; At the next instant, Judith and&#10;Hetty shrieked, and the air was filled with the yell of twenty savages,&#10;who came leaping through the branches, down the bank, some actually&#10;falling headlong into the water, in their haste.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pull, Deerslayer,&quot; cried Judith, hastily barring the door, in order&#10;to prevent an inroad by the passage through which the Delaware had just&#10;entered; &quot;pull, for life and death--the lake is full of savages, wading&#10;after us!&quot;&#10;&#10;The young men--for Chingachgook immediately came to his friend's&#10;assistance" />
    <node id="The dialogue between Deerslayer and the Delaware (Chingachgook) revolves around their recent encounters and exertions. Deerslayer briefly narrates his activities, focusing on the outlines and avoiding details about his victory over an Iroquois and his efforts to help two deserted young women. Chingachgook then shares his account with caution and restraint, describing their situation and the presence of enemy Mingos nearby.&#10;&#10;In the dialogue:&#10;&#10;1. Deerslayer inquires about any news regarding the captives, including the father of the two girls and another person who is likely to be Judith's lover.&#10;2. Chingachgook informs Deerslayer that he has seen the captives but did not find them in a position to rescue. He describes the Mingo encampment near a spring, close to where Hutter and Hurry were captured.&#10;3. Both characters converse in the Delaware tongue, which is translated into liberal English for better understanding by the narrator.&#10;4. The dialogue highlights their shared goals of liberating their friends and planning their next steps wisely to avoid enemy Mingos.&#10;5. Judith, one of the young women, actively participates in the conversation, expressing her concerns about their situation and offering support to Deerslayer." />

As that dialect, however, is but little&#10;understood, even by the learned; we shall not only on this, but on all&#10;subsequent occasions render such parts as it may be necessary to give&#10;closely, into liberal English; preserving, as far as possible, the idiom&#10;and peculiarities of the respective speakers, by way of presenting the&#10;pictures in the most graphic forms to the minds of the readers.&#10;&#10;It is unnecessary to enter into the details first related by Deerslayer,&#10;who gave a brief narrative of the facts that are already familiar to&#10;those who have read our pages. In relating these events, however, it&#10;may be well to say that the speaker touched only on the outlines, more&#10;particularly abstaining from saying anything about his encounter with,&#10;and victory over the Iroquois, as well as to his own exertions in behalf&#10;of the two deserted young women. When Deerslayer ended, the Delaware&#10;took up the narrative, in turn, speaking sententiously and with grave&#10;dignity.

This change favoring the&#10;design of Deerslayer, he lifted his grapnel, and the scow immediately&#10;and quite perceptibly began to drift more into the lake. The sail was&#10;set, when the motion of the craft increased to a rate not much less than&#10;two miles in the hour. As this superseded the necessity of rowing, an&#10;occupation that an Indian would not be likely to desire, Deerslayer,&#10;Chingachgook and Judith seated themselves in the stern of the scow,&#10;where they first governed its movements by holding the oar. Here they&#10;discoursed on their future movements, and on the means that ought to be&#10;used in order to effect the liberation of their friends.&#10;&#10;In this dialogue Judith held a material part, the Delaware readily&#10;understanding all she said, while his own replies and remarks, both of&#10;which were few and pithy, were occasionally rendered into English by his&#10;friend. Judith rose greatly in the estimation of her companions, in the&#10;half hour that followed. Prompt" />

He could&#10;only account for it by the fact of their being more numerous than he had&#10;at first supposed, and by their having out parties of the existence of&#10;which he was ignorant. Their regular, and permanent encampment, if the&#10;word permanent can be applied to the residence of a party that intended&#10;to remain out, in all probability, but a few weeks, was not far from&#10;the spot where Hutter and Hurry had fallen into their hands, and, as a&#10;matter of course, near a spring.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Sarpent,&quot; asked Deerslayer, when the other had ended his brief&#10;but spirited narrative, speaking always in the Delaware tongue, which&#10;for the reader's convenience only we render into the peculiar vernacular&#10;of the speaker--&quot;Well, Sarpent, as you've been scouting around these&#10;Mingos, have you anything to tell us of their captyves, the father of&#10;these young women, and of another, who, I somewhat conclude, is the&#10;lovyer of one of 'em.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Chingachgook has seen them" />

    <node id="1. The young man (Deerslayer) and Chingachgook have a conversation during which they discuss recent events, specifically Deerslayer's victory over an Iroquois and his efforts to help two deserted young women. Chingachgook shares that he has seen the captives but did not find them in a position to rescue, describing the Mingo encampment near a spring where Hutter and Hurry were captured.&#10;&#10;2. The event of the morning refers to Deerslayer's victory over an Iroquois who was attempting to scalp him. He shares this information with Chingachgook, being careful not to boast about his achievement.&#10;&#10;3. They also discuss their plans to move the Ark away from land as it has become dark and a light wind is blowing.&#10;&#10;4. In the cultural context of the Mingo tribe, scalping is considered an honorable act that brings glory to the tribe. The removal of the enemy's scalp signifies the warrior's bravery and strength. However, Chingachgook points out that it may not be possible for Deerslayer to retrieve the Mingo's scalp as his body has likely been hidden in a place where Delaware cunning will never be able to reach it." />

The glory belongs to the tribe;&#10;it must not be lost.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is easy talking, but 'twill not be as easy doing. The Mingo's body&#10;is in the hands of his fri'nds and, no doubt, is hid in some hole where&#10;Delaware cunning will never be able to get at the scalp.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young man then gave his friend a succinct, but clear account, of the&#10;event of the morning, concealing nothing of any moment, and yet touching&#10;on every thing modestly and with a careful attention to avoid the Indian&#10;habit of boasting. Chingachgook again expressed his satisfaction at the&#10;honour won by his friend, and then both arose, the hour having arrived&#10;when it became prudent to move the Ark further from the land.&#10;&#10;It was now quite dark, the heavens having become clouded, and the stars&#10;hid. The north wind had ceased--as was usual with the setting of the&#10;sun, and a light air arose" />
    <node id=" and&#10;sweet, nearly to a whisper, as she continued the discourse.&#10;&#10;&quot;Chingachgook!&quot; returned the Delaware girl, sighing out the harsh&#10;name, in sounds so softly guttural, as to cause it to reach the ear in&#10;melody--&quot;His father, Uncas--great chief of the Mahicanni--next to old&#10;Tamenund!--More as warrior, not so much gray hair, and less at Council&#10;Fire. You know Serpent?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He joined us last evening, and was in the Ark with me, for two or three&#10;hours before I left it. I'm afraid, Hist--&quot; Hetty could not pronounce&#10;the Indian name of her new friend, but having heard Deerslayer give her&#10;this familiar appellation, she used it without any of the ceremony of&#10;civilized life--&quot;I'm afraid Hist, he has come after scalps, as well as&#10;my poor father and Hurry Harry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why he shouldn't--ha? Chingachgook red warrior--very red--scalp make&#10;his honor--Be sure he take him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then,&quot; said Hetty, earnestly, &quot;he will" />
    <node id="The text suggests that Hetty continued to question Hist (Wah-ta-Wah) about the possibility of the Serpent marrying Chingachgook, despite being told not to speak of him, due to her excitement and delight upon discovering that they both knew Deerslayer. This new connection seemed to overwrite the previous warning and put Hetty at ease. Additionally, Hetty's questions about Chingachgook may be driven by her curiosity and interest in the Delaware warrior, as well as her desire to learn more about Hist's background and culture." />

It&#10;was her wish to reach the camp, and, sustained by her motives, she felt&#10;no more concern for the consequences than did her companion herself,&#10;now the latter was apprised of the character of the protection that the&#10;pale-face maiden carried with her. Still, as they proceeded slowly along&#10;a shore that was tangled with overhanging bushes, Hetty continued the&#10;discourse, assuming the office of interrogating which the other had&#10;instantly dropped, as soon as she ascertained the character of the mind&#10;to which her questions had been addressed.&#10;&#10;&quot;But you are not half-witted,&quot; said Hetty, &quot;and there's no reason why&#10;the Serpent should not marry you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hist prisoner, and Mingo got big ear.

    <node id="Hetty agrees to be Hist's friend because of their mutual connection through Deerslayer and her excitement about finding someone else who knows him. Additionally, Hetty is curious about Hist's background and culture, which drives her to continue questioning Hist despite being told not to speak of Chingachgook. Despite their cultural differences, particularly Hist's initial fascination with scalping which Hetty finds disturbing, Hetty still wants to be friends with Hist and understand her better. Hist also shows a desire to befriend Hetty by settling preliminaries to their mutual satisfaction and teaching Hetty about Delaware customs, such as the importance of holding one's tongue." />

Enough was revealed on both&#10;sides, however, to let each party get a tolerable insight into the views&#10;of the other, though enough still remained in mental reservation,&#10;to give rise to the following questions and answers, with which the&#10;interview in effect closed. As the quickest witted, Hist was the first&#10;with her interrogatories. Folding an arm about the waist of Hetty, she&#10;bent her head so as to look up playfully into the face of the other,&#10;and, laughing, as if her meaning were to be extracted from her looks,&#10;she spoke more plainly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hetty got broder, as well as fader?--&quot; she said--&quot;Why no talk of&#10;broder, as well as fader?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no brother, Hist.

Better not talk of any but fader and Hurry--Mingo understand&#10;dat; he no understand t'udder. Promise you no talk about what you no&#10;understand.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I do understand this, Hist, and so I must talk about it. Deerslayer&#10;as good as told father all about it, in my presence, and as nobody&#10;told me not to listen, I overheard it all, as I did Hurry and father's&#10;discourse about the scalps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very bad for pale-faces to talk about scalps, and very bad for young&#10;woman to hear!

Wah-ta-Wah, also known as Hist, is the betrothed of Chingachgook, who is a noble, tall, handsome, and athletic young Indian warrior and the chief of the Mohicans, known by the name Big Sarpent.&#10;2. She displays remarkable self-possession when reunited with her lover Chingachgook, even though their meeting is unexpected and in the presence of her captors.&#10;3. From the fact that her father was a warrior employed by the authorities during her childhood, we can infer that Wah-ta-Wah grew up near European settlers and military forts and had contact with them from a young age.&#10;4. She has also caught a knowledge of the English tongue, which she speaks fluently and without reluctance, indicating that she may have had formal education or exposure to the language through her father's interactions with the colonists.&#10;5.

This indulgence was in accordance with the&#10;general policy of the red man, who well knew, moreover, that her trail&#10;could have been easily followed in the event of flight. It will also be&#10;remembered that the Iroquois, or Hurons, as it would be better to call&#10;them, were entirely ignorant of the proximity of her lover, a fact,&#10;indeed, that she did not know herself.&#10;&#10;It is not easy to say which manifested the most self-possession at this&#10;unexpected meeting; the pale-face, or the red girl. But, though a little&#10;surprised, Wah-ta-Wah was the most willing to speak, and far the readier&#10;in foreseeing consequences, as well as in devising means to avert them.&#10;Her father, during her childhood, had been much employed as a warrior by&#10;the authorities of" />
    <node id="Based on Deerslayer's current knowledge and observations, it can be inferred that Chingachgook, the Delaware chief, is safe, as he has arrived at the agreed-upon location and has been identified by Deerslayer. However, his situation remains uncertain due to the surrounding enemies and the danger they pose. Chingachgook's caution and restraint in asking questions suggest that he is aware of the risks and is exercising his typical Indian wariness.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer has not yet had the opportunity to discuss their plans or inform Chingachgook about recent events, including the captives' situation and Deerslayer's victory over an Iroquois. Therefore, Chingachgook may not be fully aware of his friends' whereabouts or the positions of their enemies.&#10;&#10;To summarize, while Chingachgook is safe for the moment, there are still significant risks and uncertainties surrounding his situation. Deerslayer and Chingachgook will likely need to share information and coordinate their plans to ensure each other's safety and work towards liberating their friends." />
    <node id="When Deerslayer and Judith realize that Hetty might be in danger and they see a canoe near their embayed Ark, they react with concern and urgency. Deerslayer lays aside his rifle and seizes an oar, instructing Judith to keep the scow straight while he attempts to secure the canoe to the side of the Ark. He then lowers the sail and arrests the motion of the Ark using the oars. Judith, in turn, calls out to her sister Hetty, who she believes is in the canoe, with increasing concern and affection in her voice. When Hetty does not respond, Deerslayer asks Judith why her sister has left them, to which Judith reveals that Hetty may have gone on a &quot;mad scheme&quot; to help her father and Hurry Harry, despite her weak-mindedness and lack of cunning. The two men then row with all their might to catch up to Hetty's canoe, but she makes several unexpected turns and eventually disappears into the shadows of the forest, making it impossible for them to see or hear her. Deerslayer and Judith are left in a state of suspense, unsure of Hetty's fate and concerned for her safety." />
    <node id=" trees and bushes would have almost concealed&#10;her person, had there been light, but in that obscurity it was utterly&#10;impossible to discover any object thus shaded, at the distance of a few&#10;feet. Flight, too, was perfectly easy, as twenty steps would effectually&#10;bury her in the forest. She remained, therefore, watching with intense&#10;anxiety the result of her expedient, intending to call the attention&#10;of the others to the canoe with her voice, should they appear to&#10;pass without observing it. The Ark approached under its sail, again,&#10;Deerslayer standing in its bow, with Judith near him, and the Delaware&#10;at the helm. It would seem that in the bay below it had got too close to&#10;the shore, in the lingering hope of intercepting Hetty, for, as it came&#10;nearer, the latter distinctly heard the directions that the young man&#10;forward gave to his companion aft, in order to clear the point.&#10;&#10;&quot;Lay her head more off the shore, Delaware,&quot; said Deerslayer for the&#10;third time, speaking in English that his fair companion might understand&#10;his words--&quot;Lay her head well off shore.

Her hair fell in long dark braids down&#10;her shoulders and back, and was parted above a low smooth forehead, in&#10;a way to soften the expression of eyes that were full of archness and&#10;natural feeling.

Her voice, as has been already&#10;intimated, was soft as the sighing of the night air, a characteristic of&#10;the females of her race, but which was so conspicuous in herself as&#10;to have produced for her the name of Wah-ta-Wah; which rendered into&#10;English means Hist-oh-Hist.&#10;&#10;In a word, this was" />

Curiosity and confidence: Judith becomes intrigued by Deerslayer's unique personality and develops a level of trust in him that she has never felt with another man before.&#10;4. Shared goals and cooperation: Both Judith and Deerslayer are focused on rescuing their loved ones, which leads to a collaborative relationship between them as they work together towards this common goal.&#10;5.

    <node id="Hetty came to know the secret of Deerslayer and Hurry's plan to rescue Hist's father from the Iroquois because she overheard their conversation about it, as nobody had told her not to listen. This is stated in the narrative when Hetty says, &quot;Deerslayer as good as told father all about it, in my presence, and as nobody told me not to listen, I overheard it all.&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the conversation near the lake, we can infer that Wah-ta-Wah, also known as Hist-oh-Hist, is a Delaware woman who is engaged to Chingachgook, a Mohican warrior and chief. She grew up near European settlers and military forts, which allowed her to learn English and interact with people from different cultures. This background is evident in her ability to speak fluent English and her understanding of European customs.&#10;&#10;In terms of her interaction with Hetty, Wah-ta-Wah comes across as a gentle, friendly, and self-possessed person. She displays a willingness to make friends with Hetty, despite their cultural differences, by settling preliminaries to their mutual satisfaction and teaching Hetty about Delaware customs, such as the importance of holding one's tongue.&#10;&#10;However, Wah-ta-Wah also has strong feelings towards her culture and people, which is evident in her views on scalping. She believes that taking scalps is an honorable tradition for her people, while Hetty finds it disturbing. Despite this difference, Hist advises Hetty not to make any allusion to the presence of Chingachgook or the motive of his visit to the lake, demonstrating her thoughtfulness and intelligence in navigating cultural differences.&#10;&#10;Overall, Wah-ta-Wah's background and interaction with Hetty suggest that she is a complex character who values honor, tradition, and friendship. She is open to interacting with people from different cultures but also holds onto her Delaware beliefs and customs." />
    <node id="The officers' occasional visits on the lake had an effect on the young stranger's (Deerslayer) influence over the lady (Judith). These visits had caused Judith to become aware of the hollow association between superior and inferior, as she was regarded as a plaything rather than an equal and a friend by even the kindest officers. In contrast, Deerslayer treated her with guileless truth of character and feeling, which were novelties for Judith, leading her to feel more confident and open towards him.&#10;&#10;The relationship between Judith and Deerslayer differed from her relationships with the officers in several ways. Firstly, Judith's interactions with Deerslayer were not based on her vanity being gratified or her self-love being awakened, but rather on mutual respect and a growing friendship. Secondly, Deerslayer saw Judith as an equal and a friend, which was a refreshing change from the officers who saw her as a plaything. Lastly, Judith felt more at ease with Deerslayer, allowing herself to be open and honest about her feelings, something she had not done with the officers." />

Hurry's fine face and manly form had never&#10;compensated for his boisterous and vulgar tone, and her intercourse with&#10;the officers had prepared her to make comparisons under which even his&#10;great natural advantages suffered. But this very intercourse with the&#10;officers who occasionally came upon the lake to fish and hunt, had an&#10;effect in producing her present sentiments towards the young stranger.&#10;With them, while her vanity had been gratified, and her self-love&#10;strongly awakened, she had many causes deeply to regret the&#10;acquaintance--if not to mourn over it, in secret sorrow--for it was&#10;impossible for one of her quick intellect not to perceive how hollow was&#10;the association between superior and inferior, and that she was regarded&#10;as the play thing of an idle hour, rather than as an equal and a friend,&#10;by even the" />

Judith confirms this by saying that she has articles of dress that will catch the eyes of any women in the camp, and should the worst come to the worst, they can open the great chest which holds things that may tempt the chiefs.

    <node id="The narrative does not provide information about what happened to Hetty's brother. As for why she doesn't talk about him, it is likely because he has passed away, which is why her father is being held captive by the Iroquois - they are seeking revenge for his death. This is implied when Hetty mentions that she intends to tell the Indian chief that God will not forgive murder and thefts, suggesting that her brother was murdered. Hetty's silence about her brother could also be due to the grief and pain associated with his loss, as well as the cultural differences between her and Hist, which may make it difficult for her to bring up such a sensitive topic." />
    <node id="The large, isolated rock near the outlet of the lake, where Deerslayer expected to meet his friend, is described as having a shape similar to that of beehives or hay-cocks. It stands within fifty feet of the bank, in water that is usually two feet deep, though there are seasons when its rounded apex is covered by the lake. The rock's height could scarcely equal six feet. When seen from a distance, trees stretch so far forward that they blend the rock with the shore, and one tall pine overhangs it, forming a canopy to a seat that has held many forest chieftains throughout unknown ages.&#10;&#10;Based on this description, we can infer that the rock has a rounded or dome-like shape and is relatively short in height.

It was a large, isolated stone that rested on&#10;the bottom of the lake, apparently left there when the waters tore away&#10;the earth from around it, in forcing for themselves a passage down the&#10;river, and which had obtained its shape from the action of the elements,&#10;during the slow progress of centuries.

He dropped his grapnel, as soon as he found the Ark&#10;had drifted in a line that was directly to windward of the rock. The&#10;motion of the scow was then checked, when it was brought head to wind,&#10;by the action of the breeze. As soon as this was done, Deerslayer &quot;paid&#10;out line,&quot; and suffered the vessel to &quot;set down&quot; upon the rock, as fast&#10;as the light air could force it to leeward. Floating entirely on the&#10;surface, this was soon effected, and the young man checked the drift&#10;when he was told that the stern of the scow was within fifteen or&#10;eighteen feet of the desired spot.&#10;&#10;In executing this maneuver, Deerslayer had proceeded promptly, for,&#10;while he did not in the least doubt that he was both watched and&#10;followed by the foe, he believed he distracted their movements, by the&#10;apparent uncertainty of his own, and he knew they could have no means&#10;of ascertaining that the rock was his aim, unless indeed one of their&#10;prisoners" />

She teaches Hetty about Delaware customs, such as the importance of holding one's tongue.&#10;&#10;Regarding Hetty's plan to respond to Wah-ta-Wah's appeal about Chingachgook, the narrative states that Hetty agrees not to make any allusion to Chingachgook's presence or motives for visiting the lake, following Hist's advice.

They attempt to secure the canoe to the Ark and row after Hetty, who makes unexpected turns and eventually disappears into the forest shadows, making it impossible for them to see or hear her.

From the fact that her father was a warrior employed by the authorities during her childhood, we can infer that Wah-ta-Wah grew up near European settlers and military forts and had contact with them from a young age.&#10;4.

Wah-ta-Wah is depicted as being more willing to speak and foreseeing consequences, showing a level of intelligence and adaptability that has helped her navigate her people's conflict with the Iroquois or Hurons.">

Chingachgook's caution and restraint in asking questions suggest that he is aware of the risks and is exercising his typical Indian wariness.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer has not yet had the opportunity to discuss their plans or inform Chingachgook about recent events, including the captives' situation and Deerslayer's victory over an Iroquois.

    <edge source="Based on the conversation near the lake, we can infer that Wah-ta-Wah, also known as Hist-oh-Hist, is a Delaware woman who is engaged to Chingachgook, a Mohican warrior and chief. She grew up near European settlers and military forts, which allowed her to learn English and interact with people from different cultures. This background is evident in her ability to speak fluent English and her understanding of European customs.&#10;&#10;In terms of her interaction with Hetty, Wah-ta-Wah comes across as a gentle, friendly, and self-possessed person. She displays a willingness to make friends with Hetty, despite their cultural differences, by settling preliminaries to their mutual satisfaction and teaching Hetty about Delaware customs, such as the importance of holding one's tongue.&#10;&#10;However, Wah-ta-Wah also has strong feelings towards her culture and people, which is evident in her views on scalping. She believes that taking scalps is an honorable tradition for her people, while Hetty finds it disturbing. Despite this difference, Hist advises Hetty not to make any allusion to the presence of Chingachgook or the motive of his visit to the lake, demonstrating her thoughtfulness and intelligence in navigating cultural differences.&#10;&#10;Overall, Wah-ta-Wah's background and interaction with Hetty suggest that she is a complex character who values honor, tradition, and friendship. She is open to interacting with people from different cultures but also holds onto her Delaware beliefs and customs." target="Based on the narrative provided, there is no explicit mention of a &quot;rule among the Mingos (which I assume refers to the Delaware or Lenape people) regarding showing affection.&quot; However, we do see that Wah-ta-Wah, a Delaware woman, is friendly and open to making friends with Hetty, despite their cultural differences. She teaches Hetty about Delaware customs, such as the importance of holding one's tongue.&#10;&#10;Regarding Hetty's plan to respond to Wah-ta-Wah's appeal about Chingachgook, the narrative states that Hetty agrees not to make any allusion to Chingachgook's presence or motives for visiting the lake, following Hist's advice. This shows Hetty's willingness to respect Wah-ta-Wah's culture and customs, even if she finds certain aspects of it disturbing, such as the practice of scalping.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no explicit mention of a rule regarding showing affection among the Delaware people, we do see that both Hetty and Wah-ta-Wah are open to making friends with each other, despite their cultural differences.

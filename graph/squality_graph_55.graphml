It is not specified whether they returned with the helicopter or not, but they were no longer outside when it landed.&#10;2. Asa and Harriet need to return to the helicopter despite the challenges of operating it in the given conditions because it is their only means of transportation back to the settlement. The wilderness of bog they are in has no landmarks to help them find their way, and attempting to carry the valuable egg back on foot would result in repeated attacks from Sliders, making it impossible for a single person to transport the egg over five miles. Additionally, Asa's radio is only able to contact the helicopter, so they cannot call for any alternative assistance." />
    <node id=". &quot;What happened to the other muck men who went out today?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of them may not have got back yet.&quot;" />
    <node id=" you took the helicopter by yourself,&quot; Asa said, as if he could hardly believe it yet.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used to this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up straight?&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of the plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in the mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held it with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.&#10; &#10; &quot;We fight off the Sliders, then,&quot; she said, as matter of factly as if that problem was settled. &quot;If it's any comfort, I know how to handle the machine-gun.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before we could see them. We've got to try to get back.&quot; He stood in thought while she stared at him patiently. &quot;What happened to the other muck men who went out today?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;They were called in when the 'copter came" />
    <node id=" &#10;&#10; &#10; Asa took a deep breath and looked around.&#10; &#10; &quot;Kershaw!&quot; he called. &quot;Where are you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Over here.&quot; Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again. Asa leaped over to him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kershaw said. &quot;Muck men stick together. You'll make a good one. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,&quot; Asa said. He looked over at the dead Slider and shook his head. &quot;Tell me, what are the odds on getting killed doing this?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six eggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring the eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance where it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried the egg.&#10; &#10; &quot;Just in case there are any more Sliders around,&quot; he explained.&#10; &#10; &quot;Makes no difference,&quot; said Kers" />

The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they lost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.&#10; &#10; What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at night. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in this strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....&#10; &#10; A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.&#10; &#10; Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed helicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming back alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the carcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.&#10; &#10; No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big machine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to hover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward.

    <node id=" jumped aside, the landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter flipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into the mud.&#10; &#10; Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe passage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the extra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose of the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the controls to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; IV&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you hurt?&quot; Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady herself as she climbed out of the machine.&#10; &#10; &quot;I guess not,&quot; she said. &quot;But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun. From the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty soon.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What happened?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I made a fool of myself.&quot; She made a face back in the direction of the settlement. &quot;Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone who talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.&quot;&#10; &#10; She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.&#10; " />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty minutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.&#10; &#10; After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return for the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg approximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the egg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.&#10; &#10; Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,&quot; he said. &quot;When are you coming?&quot;&#10; &#10; There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.&#10; &#10; If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him all along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an egg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he would be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from which he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip. There were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his way. The workers were supposed to home in on" />
    <node id="1. The odds of getting killed while bringing out eggs were roughly one in six, according to Kershaw's experience. This is based on the fact that for every six eggs brought out, one mucker was killed.&#10;2. Asa is taking several steps to ensure the safety of the egg he just found:&#10;   - He buries the egg in the muck, &quot;just in case there are any more Sliders around.&quot; This is a precaution against additional Slider attacks, as Sliders seem to be attracted to the eggs.&#10;   - Asa also decides not to attempt carrying the egg back on foot, knowing that Sliders would attack him repeatedly along the way and that it would be nearly impossible for a single person to transport the egg over five miles through the treacherous bog terrain.&#10;   - When the helicopter fails to return as expected, Asa comes up with a plan to hide the egg in a safe location until help arrives, rather than leaving it behind or attempting to carry it back on his own. He decides to stall and convince Dorr to take him along in the helicopter to ensure the egg's safety.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on Kershaw's experience, there is a high chance of getting killed while bringing out eggs (1 in 6), and Asa is taking measures to protect the egg he found by burying it, deciding not to carry it back on foot, and strategizing to ensure its safety during transportation." />

He held it, still smeared with traces of mud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. &quot;Just look at it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; A SLIDER EGG&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds being splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's earphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the scintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider for help. Asa looked around.&#10; &#10; &quot;Jump!&quot; he shouted.&#10; &#10; At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black scales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the weeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row upon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered its head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot forward.&#10; &#10; Asa leaped" />

Through the transparent nose Asa could see Tom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open and leaned out.&#10; &#10; &quot;I see you took care of the Slider,&quot; he said. &quot;Hand over the egg.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Kershaw has a broken leg,&quot; Asa said. &quot;I'll help him in and then I'll get the egg.&quot;&#10; &#10; While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the helicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the waist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was. Kershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred pounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.&#10; &#10; Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's shoulder and strained to get him in." />

Once he was inside, Asa saw, the cabin was crowded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you going to have room for me too?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not this trip,&quot; Dorr answered. &quot;Now give me the egg.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa didn't hesitate. &quot;The egg stays with me,&quot; he said softly.&#10; &#10; &quot;You do what I tell you, mucker,&quot; said Dorr.&#10; &#10; &quot;Nope. I want to make sure you come back.&quot; Asa turned his head to Harriet. &quot;You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might ask him to tell you about it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that worried Asa.&#10; &#10; &quot;Whatever you say, Graybar,&quot; Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In another minute the helicopter was in the sky.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty minutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at" />

The bursts of light from a Slider's egg are believed by Kershaw to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, as they sparkle like a million diamonds and immediately attract Sliders towards them. This theory is supported by Asa when he observes that right after an egg is scooped out of the muck, a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.&#10;2. Kershaw manages to handle the Sliders when attempting to catch them by first trying to catch it with a rocket. If he misses, he starts leaping for home base, which is the pit they come from. The Sliders are not able to follow them into the pit, giving Kershaw and other muck men a safe space to work in." />
    <node id=" discharges from the egg, but the phenomenon remained a mystery.&#10; &#10; Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to question its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only random, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of light, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.&#10; &#10; It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and fading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had ever seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have made him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.&#10; &#10; &quot;You know what I think?&quot; Kershaw asked. &quot;I think those flashes are the egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when you scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've been meaning to ask you,&quot; Asa said. &quot;How do you handle the Sliders?&quot;&#10; &#10; Kershaw grinned.&#10; &#10; &quot;First you try to catch it with a rocket.

While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio down from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned instantly, his gun in his hand.&#10; &#10; &quot;Calling the 'copter!&quot; he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. &quot;Kershaw and Graybar, sector eight, five miles out.

Kershaw must have been bowled over by the Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the other had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where Kershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working madly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another charge.&#10; &#10; Aim" />

From her appearance and behavior, it can be inferred that she is not the typical &quot;hothouse-flower&quot; type that Asa would have expected as the daughter of a wealthy man. She meets his eye without fear or disgust, showing a degree of strength and curiosity. Her presence at the trial suggests that she wants to see justice done, but her puzzled expression hints that she may not fully understand the complexities of her father's business dealings or Asa's situation." />

    <node id=" not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.&#10; &#10; Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt certain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for the charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his laboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of the courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.&#10; &#10; Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back behind bars.&#10; &#10; &quot;Guilty,&quot; Jumpy said.&#10; &#10; Asa glared at him.&#10; &#10; &quot;I know, I know,&quot; Jumpy said hastily. &quot;You were framed. But what's the rap?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Five or one.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Take the five,&quot; Jumpy advised. &quot;Learn basket-weaving in a nice air-conditioned rehab clinic.

    <node id="1. Asa is a worker on a planet where Sliders, large worm-like creatures, lay eggs that emit bursts of light. These bursts are believed to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, immediately attracting other Sliders towards them.&#10;2. While attempting to collect one of these eggs, Asa's partner Kershaw is injured and unable to move quickly. A Slider approaches, wanting to take back the egg.&#10;3. To protect the egg from the Slider, Asa calls for backup from Kershaw and Graybar via radio. He informs them of their location, five miles out in sector eight, and requests that they hurry.&#10;4. The situation requires Asa to call for backup because he is unable to both protect the egg and carry it back to safety on his own. Sliders will attack anyone attempting to leave the area with an egg, and leaving the egg behind would not guarantee a safe return due to the lack of landmarks in the wilderness." />

All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand. When the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in the mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back and hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter comes—and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake—you live to tell the tale.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to learn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another physical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was pounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the doctor had apparently learned to make allowances.&#10; &#10; &quot;Swallow this,&quot; said the doctor after making a series of tests.&#10; &#10; Asa swallowed the capsule.

And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Still,&quot; Asa mused aloud, &quot;it would mean a nice bankroll waiting at the end of the year.&quot;&#10; &#10; He leaned forward to fill in the necessary form.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special environments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion chambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa Graybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard to bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.&#10; &#10; Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once one of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on spaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he decided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all he learned about space travel.&#10; &#10; Nevertheless his time was not wasted.

I'm going to be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt Slider eggs.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Smuggling? It won't work.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because he had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The Hazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years of so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's Planet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched world, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could duplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.&#10; &#10; His only problem would be staying alive for a year.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; An interview with a doctor from the Conversion Corps was required for all persons who elected changeling status.

Last, of course, there's always a need for muck men on Jordan's Planet.&quot;&#10; &#10; The doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to choose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the alternatives.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the pay range?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von Neumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa raised his eyebrows.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why such a difference? Everyone knows about muck men living in the mud while they hunt Slider eggs. But don't your conversions make the changeling comfortable in his new environment?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure they do,&quot; said the doctor. &quot;We can make you think mud feels better than chinchilla fur and we can have you jumping like a grasshopper despite the double gravity. But we can't make you like the sight of yourself. And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="The Conversion Corps and medical regeneration technology serve the purpose of adapting humans to various environments, particularly those on other planets. Medical regeneration made it possible to regrow damaged or deficient organs, which was then used to specialize human growth for the specific conditions of different planets. However, this was declared unethical by medical associations after a short fad of deliberate deformities.&#10;&#10;The Conversion Corps was established to address the issue of few people wanting to become changelings despite the high pay offered by planetary development companies. The Corps permitted convicted criminals to earn their freedom by putting in one year as a changeling for every five years they would otherwise have had to spend in rehabilitation.&#10;&#10;Asa, the story's protagonist, intends to use the Conversion Corps to his advantage by becoming a muck man and going to Jordan's Planet to hunt Slider eggs, which could potentially cause trouble for Hazeltyne, the company that framed him. The outcomes of these technologies and programs are mixed, as they offer opportunities for people like Asa but also involve significant risks, such as the unknown dangers of altered shapes and the potential harm from companies exploiting those who choose this path." />
    <node id=" Conversion Corps was required for all persons who elected changeling status. The law stated that potential changelings must be fully informed of the rights and hazards of altered shape before they signed a release. The requirement held whether or not the individual, like Asa, was already experienced.&#10; &#10; By the time humanity traveled to the stars, medical biology had made it possible to regenerate damaged or deficient organs of the body. Regeneration was limited only by advanced age. Sometime after a man's two hundredth year his body lost the ability to be coaxed into growing new cells. A fifth set of teeth was usually one's last. As long as senescence could be staved off, however, any man could have bulging biceps and a pencil waist, if he could pay for the treatment.&#10; &#10; Until the medical associations declared such treatments unethical there was even a short fad of deliberate deformities, with horns at the temples particularly popular.&#10; &#10; From regeneration it was a short step to specialized regrowth. The techniques were perfected to adapt humans to the dozen barely habitable worlds man had discovered.

Even on Mars, the only planet outside Earth in the solar system where the human anatomy was remotely suitable, a man could work more efficiently with redesigned lungs and temperature controls than he could inside a pressure suit. On more bizarre planets a few light-years away the advantages of changeling bodies were greater.&#10; &#10; Unfortunately for planetary development companies, hardly anyone wanted to become a changeling. High pay lured few. So a law was passed permitting a convicted criminal to earn his freedom by putting in one year as a changeling for every five years he would otherwise have had to spend in rehabilitation.&#10; &#10; &quot;What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?&quot; Asa asked the man assigned to his case.

Asa and the speaker (Harriet) need to return to the settlement with the helicopter, which is their only means of transportation. They cannot find their way through the wilderness of bog without landmarks, and carrying the valuable egg on foot would be impossible due to Slider attacks and the distance to the settlement. Additionally, Asa's radio can only contact the helicopter for assistance.&#10;3. To help Asa and Harriet get back in the helicopter and fly it in the drizzle at night, they will have to address the challenges of the Sliders and the helicopter being stuck in the mud:&#10;   - Sliders: They plan to fight off any Sliders that come near the helicopter. Harriet knows how to handle the machine-gun on the helicopter, which may provide some protection. However, in the drizzle and at night, it would be difficult to see Sliders approaching until it's too late.&#10;   - Helicopter stuck in mud: Asa attempted to pull the rotor blade out of the mud but was unsuccessful due to its weight and the suction from the mud. They may need to find a way to free the rotor blades before they can fly the helicopter." />
    <node id="1. The helicopter accident was caused when Asa and Harriet were attempting to take off in the helicopter, but it became entangled with a dead Slider on the ground, causing the helicopter to flip forward and one of its rotor blades to plunge into the mud.&#10;2.

This theory is supported by Asa when he observes that right after an egg is scooped out of the muck, a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.&#10;2. The Sliders' behavior in relation to these flashes involves them being attracted to the eggs when they emit light, possibly as a response to the eggs calling out for help or protection. This is evident when Asa and Kershaw are attempting to collect an egg and a Slider appears, wanting to take back the egg. When Asa calls for backup, the Slider becomes aggressive and tries to charge at them, showing its territorial nature." />

There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to go crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine thousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that flashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could understand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while the albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic filaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played tiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life. Electrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but the phenomenon remained a mystery.&#10; &#10; Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to question" />
    <node id="1. After reviving from conversion, Asa and Kershaw go outside to prepare for their role as muck men on Jordan's Planet. They are in the courtyard of the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement, which is partly covered by a roof and partially open to the gray drizzle that is common on the planet.&#10;&#10;2. In the courtyard, they encounter Furston, a muck man who is a foot taller than Kershaw and significantly larger in proportion. He greets them and asks for their names.&#10;&#10;3. The courtyard also contains thirty stalls for muck men along the far wall, which is enclosed by a high wall. This area is exposed to the elements, while the other half of the courtyard is covered." />
    <node id="haw's head.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's the way,&quot; Kershaw said approvingly. &quot;Now get this on and we'll go outside.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of fabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as Kershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room where they had been left to revive from conversion.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard was open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky of Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud flats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged along the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.&#10; &#10; From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them in two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were a gun and a long knife.&#10; &#10; &quot;Names?&quot; he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big everywhere in proportion.&#10; &#10; &quot;Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.&quot;" />
    <node id=" after Kershaw.&#10; &#10; Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the Hazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The mud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was not at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins like a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded and splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced eye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.&#10; &#10; &quot;Keep your eyes open,&quot; Kershaw said. &quot;There's a Slider been around here lately. If you see something like an express train headed our way, start shooting.&quot;&#10; &#10; At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no Sliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as much as on top of it.&#10; &#10; Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten yards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in the muck.&#10; &#10; &quot;We're in luck,&quot; he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. &quot;An egg was laid somewhere here within" />
    <node id="1. The bursts of light from a Slider's egg are believed to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, attracting other Sliders towards them. This is supported by the observation that right after an egg is scooped out of the muck, a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.&#10;2. Kershaw handles Sliders when attempting to catch them by first trying to catch it with a rocket. If he misses, he starts leaping for home base (the pit they come from), as Sliders are not able to follow them into the pit.&#10;3. The flashes of light from a Slider's egg are significant in understanding their behavior and the challenges faced by Asa and Kershaw. These bursts are believed to be calls for help, which immediately attract Sliders towards the eggs. This makes it difficult for Asa and Kershaw to collect and preserve the eggs, as Sliders will attack anyone attempting to leave the area with an egg.&#10;4. Asa's quest to keep the Slider eggs alive is complicated by this territorial behavior and the need to protect the eggs from both Sliders and other potential threats. In the story excerpt provided, Kershaw's method of handling Sliders focuses on using a pit as a safe space while attempting to collect eggs, but further methods may be needed to successfully preserve and transport them." />
    <node id="1. Asa plans to become a muck man and go to Jordan's Planet to hunt Slider eggs in order to study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could duplicate. This would allow him to continue his work on keeping Slider eggs alive, potentially causing trouble for the Hazeltyne company who had gone after him for this very reason. He also hopes to survive for a year on Jordan's Planet and cause trouble for Hazeltyne.&#10;2. Some challenges Asa may face in becoming a muck man and hunting Slider eggs on Jordan's Planet include:&#10;* Adapting to the double gravity of Jordan's Planet, which will require adjustments to his body and potentially make movement more difficult.&#10;* Surviving for a year on Jordan's Planet, where the environment is likely harsh and dangerous.&#10;* Hunting Slider eggs, which will involve protecting the egg from the mother Slider and other Sliders who are attracted to the light emitted by the egg. This may require quick reflexes, physical strength, and the ability to call for backup when needed.&#10;* The possibility of being killed by a Slider, as the doctor from the Conversion Corps notes that they cannot guarantee a changeling's safety in their new environment and cannot make them like the sight of themselves." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Asa and Kershaw going outside after Asa puts on a belt and breech cloth combination is to prepare for their role as muck men on Jordan's Planet.&#10;2. In the courtyard of the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement, they encounter Furston, a muck man who is much larger than Kershaw. The courtyard also contains thirty stalls for muck men along the far wall, which is enclosed by a high wall. This area is exposed to the elements, while the other half of the courtyard is covered." />
    <node id="1. Harriet is not the typical &quot;hothouse-flower&quot; type that Asa would have expected as the daughter of a wealthy man. This suggests that she may be more independent, strong-willed, and unconventional compared to other girls from affluent families.&#10;2. Asa recognizes Harriet as Hazeltyne's daughter, indicating that he has had some interaction with her father or the family in the past.&#10;3. Harriet meets Asa's eye without fear or disgust, showing a degree of strength and curiosity. This implies that she is not easily intimidated and is interested in understanding the situation better.&#10;4. Asa feels certain, without proof, that Tom Dorr was the one who framed him for grand theft. He might suspect that Harriet, being Hazeltyne's daughter, could be unaware of her father or Dorr's potential involvement in illegal activities.&#10;5. When Asa learns that he will either get five years in prison or face a changeling deal (which implies a more severe punishment), his cellmate Jumpy advises him to take the five-year sentence. Asa's determination to protect the Slider egg, despite the risks involved, suggests that he values justice and integrity over his own safety. This trait might have caught Harriet's attention and admiration.&#10;6. Based on Asa's reactions in the courtroom, we can infer that Harriet is a strong, curious, and possibly unconventional young woman who may share some of Asa's values such as justice and integrity." />
    <node id="1. Tom Dorr demands the egg because it is valuable or significant to the company they work for, or perhaps to Dorr himself. This is implied when he says &quot;I see you took care of the Slider. Hand over the egg&quot; and later on when Asa decides not to give him the egg, Dorr responds with &quot;You do what I tell you, mucker.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. The story does not provide explicit reasons for why Tom Dorr doesn't help lift Kershaw into the helicopter while Harriet Hazeltyne does. However, this could be due to various possible reasons:&#10;   - Dorr might consider himself too important or busy to assist in physically lifting Kershaw.&#10;   - There could be a gender dynamic at play, where the company culture or Dorr's personal beliefs make him less inclined to help a woman with physical labor compared to another man.&#10;   - Dorr may have wanted to maintain some distance from Asa and Kershaw, possibly due to his intentions regarding the egg or his role in the company." />
    <node id="1. Asa must learn to adapt to his &quot;distorted body,&quot; which suggests that he has undergone some physical transformation or change as a result of being on this planet. He is taught how to leap, dig, operate the radio, and use his new gun. This learning process emphasizes the need for Asa to become acclimated to the unique conditions and challenges of this alien world.&#10;2. Additionally, Asa is warned that &quot;everything that grows on this planet is poison,&quot; including the berries he vomits up after eating. This warning serves as a reminder that he is still human and that survival on this planet will require him to be extra cautious, as even the most basic necessities like food could be deadly. It also reinforces the idea that Asa is not in his normal environment and needs to be constantly vigilant to survive." />
    <node id=" The Slider, eight flippers on each side working madly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another charge.&#10; &#10; Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The rocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray flesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward Asa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw the Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs were tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the Slider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he thrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired again.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered with shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion. Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body shiver and lie still.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Asa took a deep breath and looked around.&#10; &#10; &quot;Kershaw!&quot; he called. &quot;Where are you?&quot;&#10; " />

I'm back, Furston.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm Graybar.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on, you.&quot; He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do what he says,&quot; Kershaw whispered to Graybar. &quot;He's sort of a trusty and warden and parole officer rolled into one.&quot;&#10; &#10; Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his distorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown how to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim rockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a native vine. He did so and immediately vomited.&#10; &#10; Furston laughed.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's to remind you you're still a man,&quot; Furston said, grinning.&#10;&quot;Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any ideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is where" />
    <node id="1. After being converted into a muck man, Asa initially feels panic and fear. He has lost consciousness and is now being taken to the conversion tank. When he wakes up, he feels well-rested and comfortable, but he is afraid to open his eyes.&#10;2. When Asa finally opens his eyes, he sees that Kershaw has been converted into a muck man. Kershaw now looks like an enormous frog with a mostly human head, webbed feet, huge thighs, and broad fingers tipped with spade-like claws. His arms are as thick around as an ordinary man's legs.&#10;3. Asa and Kershaw are muck men who work on Jordan's Planet, preparing for which they had gone outside after Asa put on a belt and breech cloth combination. They are in the courtyard of the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement, which is partly covered and exposed to the elements.&#10;4. Asa and Kershaw's job as muck men involves them catching Sliders, which are large predatory creatures on Jordan's Planet. The bursts of light from a Slider’s egg are believed to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, attracting Sliders towards them. To catch Sliders, Kershaw uses a rocket and lures the Sliders into the pit they come from, creating a safe space to work in.&#10;5. When Asa and Kershaw are attempting to collect an egg, a Slider appears, wanting to take back the egg. The Slider becomes aggressive and tries to charge at them, showing its territorial nature." />
    <node id=" lose consciousness.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is it!&quot; he thought in panic.&#10; &#10; He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before consciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance to back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the conversion tank right now.&#10; &#10; When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for a long time he was afraid to open his eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come on, Graybar,&quot; said a deep, booming voice. &quot;Let's test our wings.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his eyes.&#10; &#10; Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one stand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that his head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his lower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward so that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around as an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with broad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like claws. The skin was" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Asa and Kershaw going outside after Asa puts on a belt and breech cloth combination is to prepare for their role as muck men on Jordan's Planet.&#10;2. The muck man that greets them in the courtyard is Furston." />
    <node id="1. The discovery that Kershaw and Asa made in the pit is a Slider's egg, which emits bursts of light believed to be calls for help or protection, attracting other Sliders towards them.&#10;2. When the Slider emerges from the weeds, it becomes aggressive and charges at Asa and Kershaw upon realizing that they are attempting to take the egg away from the area, demonstrating its territorial behavior." />
    <node id="1. Asa Graybar's experience of being transported from Earth to another planet involves several factors. First, he is confined to a small cabin in the space freighter, making him feel like a prisoner. He has limited interaction with others, except for a fellow convict who had done time on Jordan's Planet before. Second, Asa undergoes physical and mental adjustments due to the double gravity on Jordan's Planet, which requires him to learn new skills and be cautious about his surroundings, including the poisonous plant life.&#10;2. Asa's time on the space freighter is meaningful because he uses it productively. Although confined to his cabin, he has a companion who provides valuable information about Jordan's Planet. Additionally, Asa undergoes physical preparations for his role as a muck man, which will allow him to work on the planet. The time spent on the space freighter serves as a transition period for Asa, helping him prepare for the challenges and conditions of Jordan's Planet while being unaware of what to expect." />
    <node id="1. According to Kershaw's experience, the odds of getting killed while bringing out eggs are roughly one in six. This is based on the fact that for every six eggs brought out, one mucker was killed.&#10;2. After burying the egg, Asa decides not to carry it back on foot, knowing that Sliders would attack him repeatedly along the way and that it would be nearly impossible for a single person to transport the egg over five miles through the treacherous bog terrain. Instead, when the helicopter fails to return as expected, Asa comes up with a plan to hide the egg in a safe location until help arrives. He decides to stall and convince Dorr to take him along in the helicopter to ensure the egg's safety." />
    <node id="1. The dazzling light displays from a Slider's egg are believed to be calls for help or protection, attracting other Sliders towards them. This theory is supported by the observation that right after an egg is scooped out of the muck, a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.&#10;2. The bursts of light from the egg serve as a signal to adult Sliders, who are attracted to the eggs when they emit light. This behavior demonstrates their territorial nature and protective instincts, as they become aggressive when they perceive a threat to the egg. The light displays are significant in understanding the challenges faced by Asa and Kershaw in collecting and preserving the eggs, as Sliders will attack anyone attempting to leave the area with an egg." />
    <node id="1. Asa and Kershaw were preparing to become muck men on Jordan's Planet, as indicated by them going outside after Asa puts on a belt and breech cloth combination.&#10;2. After digging in a cleared area, Asa and Kershaw found a Slider's egg. This is mentioned when Kershaw shouts &quot;Got it!&quot; and starts wiping slime off a round object the size of a baseball. The narrator also confirms this when describing the egg as having a &quot;mad radiance&quot; and being &quot;the size of a baseball.&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;We're in luck,&quot; he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. &quot;An egg was laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to spot when the new weeds start growing.&quot;&#10; &#10; Kershaw took a long look around.&#10; &#10; &quot;No trouble in sight. We dig.&quot;&#10; &#10; They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs of mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually a muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw dug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had to dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit big enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently before it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he worked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything about the operation was wrong.&#10; &#10; &quot;Got it!&quot; Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping slime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to watch.&#10; &#10; &quot;A big one,&quot;" />
    <node id="1. The Conversion Corps requirement for changeling status ensures that individuals fully understand the rights and hazards associated with altered shapes before they make a decision. This includes informing them about the potential risks and dangers involved in changing their bodies to adapt to different environments, as well as their rights as changelings.&#10;2. The history of medical regeneration and specialized regrowth technology is closely related to the Conversion Corps, as these advancements made it possible to adapt humans to various environments, particularly those on other planets. Medical regeneration allowed for the growth of new cells and organs, while specialized regrowth techniques were developed to create humans capable of surviving in specific conditions. This technology was initially popular but later declared unethical due to the trend of deliberate deformities.&#10;&#10;In the context of the story, the Conversion Corps serves as a means for Asa to become a muck man and go to Jordan's Planet to hunt Slider eggs. The risks associated with this decision are significant, as he will have to adapt to the double gravity of Jordan's Planet and survive in its harsh environment for a year. Additionally, hunting Slider eggs will be a dangerous task due to the protective nature of the mother Slider and the attraction of other Sliders to the egg's light. However, this decision allows Asa to continue his work on keeping Slider eggs alive and potentially cause trouble for Hazeltyne, the company that framed him." />
    <node id="1. Asa has undergone a physical transformation to become a &quot;muck man&quot; in order to survive on Jordan's Planet. This transformation likely involves the use of medical regeneration and specialized regrowth technology, which allowed for the growth of new cells and organs adapted to the unique conditions of the planet.&#10;2. Asa is able to adapt to his new body by learning how to move, dig, operate a radio, and use his new gun on Jordan's Planet. This process emphasizes the need for him to become acclimated to the challenges of this alien world, including double gravity, poisonous plant life, and dangerous creatures like Sliders.&#10;3. Despite the changes in his body, Asa is still able to show emotion and coordination. He plans to hunt Slider eggs to continue his work on keeping them alive, which requires quick reflexes, physical strength, and the ability to call for backup when needed. This suggests that while his body has changed, he retains his cognitive and emotional faculties, allowing him to adapt and survive in this new environment." />
    <node id="The other muck men who were called in when the helicopter arrived for the first time were likely called back to the settlement. It is not specified whether they returned with the helicopter or not, but they were no longer outside when it landed. Asa and Harriet need to return to the settlement with the helicopter, which is their only means of transportation. They cannot find their way through the wilderness of bog without landmarks, and carrying the valuable egg on foot would be impossible due to Slider attacks and the distance to the settlement. Additionally, Asa's radio can only contact the helicopter for assistance." />
    <node id="1. Tom Dorr demands the egg because it is valuable or significant to the company they work for, or perhaps to Dorr himself. He shows no concern for Kershaw's injury and only focuses on getting the egg, implying its importance.&#10;&#10;2. Dorr doesn't help lift Kershaw into the helicopter, while Harriet Hazeltyne does, possibly due to his perception of his own importance, gender dynamics, or wanting to maintain distance from Asa and Kershaw. The story does not provide explicit reasons for his behavior.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tom Dorr demands the egg after helping Kershaw into the helicopter because the egg is valuable to him or the company, and he may see himself as too important to assist with physical labor. Asa refuses to hand over the egg, suspecting that Dorr might not return for him." />
    <node id="The evidence that suggests a Slider has recently been near the area where Kershaw and Asa have stopped is the presence of a roughly circular area some ten yards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in the muck. This indicates that a Slider, known for its size and strength, likely uprooted the weeds while moving around the area." />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information on why some of the other muck men had not returned after being called in when the helicopter arrived for the first time. It can be inferred that they were called back to the settlement, but it is not specified whether they returned with the helicopter or not.

Asa is a worker on a planet where Sliders, large worm-like creatures, lay eggs that emit bursts of light. These bursts are believed to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, immediately attracting other Sliders towards them.&#10;2. While attempting to collect one of these eggs, Asa's partner Kershaw is injured and unable to move quickly. A Slider approaches, wanting to take back the egg.&#10;3. To protect the egg from the Slider, Asa calls for backup from Kershaw and Graybar via radio. He informs them of their location, five miles out in sector eight, and requests that they hurry.&#10;4. The situation requires Asa to call for backup because he is unable to both protect the egg and carry it back to safety on his own. Sliders will attack anyone attempting to leave the area with an egg, and leaving the egg behind would not guarantee a safe return due to the lack of landmarks in the wilderness.">

The bursts of light from a Slider's egg are believed to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, attracting other Sliders towards them. This is supported by the observation that right after an egg is scooped out of the muck, a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.&#10;2. Kershaw handles Sliders when attempting to catch them by first trying to catch it with a rocket. If he misses, he starts leaping for home base (the pit they come from), as Sliders are not able to follow them into the pit.&#10;3. The flashes of light from a Slider's egg are significant in understanding their behavior and the challenges faced by Asa and Kershaw. These bursts are believed to be calls for help, which immediately attract Sliders towards the eggs. This makes it difficult for Asa and Kershaw to collect and preserve the eggs, as Sliders will attack anyone attempting to leave the area with an egg.&#10;4. Asa's quest to keep the Slider eggs alive is complicated by this territorial behavior and the need to protect the eggs from both Sliders and other potential threats. In the story excerpt provided, Kershaw's method of handling Sliders focuses on using a pit as a safe space while attempting to collect eggs, but further methods may be needed to successfully preserve and transport them.">

The story does not provide explicit reasons for why Tom Dorr doesn't help lift Kershaw into the helicopter while Harriet Hazeltyne does. However, this could be due to various possible reasons:&#10;   - Dorr might consider himself too important or busy to assist in physically lifting Kershaw.&#10;   - There could be a gender dynamic at play, where the company culture or Dorr's personal beliefs make him less inclined to help a woman with physical labor compared to another man.&#10;   - Dorr may have wanted to maintain some distance from Asa and Kershaw, possibly due to his intentions regarding the egg or his role in the company.">

Kershaw now looks like an enormous frog with a mostly human head, webbed feet, huge thighs, and broad fingers tipped with spade-like claws. His arms are as thick around as an ordinary man's legs.&#10;3. Asa and Kershaw are muck men who work on Jordan's Planet, preparing for which they had gone outside after Asa put on a belt and breech cloth combination. They are in the courtyard of the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement, which is partly covered and exposed to the elements.&#10;4. Asa and Kershaw's job as muck men involves them catching Sliders, which are large predatory creatures on Jordan's Planet. The bursts of light from a Slider’s egg are believed to be the eggs calling out for their mother Slider, attracting Sliders towards them. To catch Sliders, Kershaw uses a rocket and lures the Sliders into the pit they come from, creating a safe space to work in.&#10;5. When Asa and Kershaw are attempting to collect an egg, a Slider appears, wanting to take back the egg. The Slider becomes aggressive and tries to charge at them, showing its territorial nature.">

Harriet knows how to handle the machine-gun on the helicopter, which may provide some protection. However, in the drizzle and at night, it would be difficult to see Sliders approaching until it's too late.&#10;   - Helicopter stuck in mud: Asa attempted to pull the rotor blade out of the mud but was unsuccessful due to its weight and the suction from the mud.

However, this could be due to various possible reasons:&#10;   - Dorr might consider himself too important or busy to assist in physically lifting Kershaw.&#10;   - There could be a gender dynamic at play, where the company culture or Dorr's personal beliefs make him less inclined to help a woman with physical labor compared to another man.&#10;   - Dorr may have wanted to maintain some distance from Asa and Kershaw, possibly due to his intentions regarding the egg or his role in the company.">

This is based on the fact that for every six eggs brought out, one mucker was killed.&#10;2. After burying the egg, Asa decides not to carry it back on foot, knowing that Sliders would attack him repeatedly along the way and that it would be nearly impossible for a single person to transport the egg over five miles through the treacherous bog terrain. Instead, when the helicopter fails to return as expected, Asa comes up with a plan to hide the egg in a safe location until help arrives. He decides to stall and convince Dorr to take him along in the helicopter to ensure the egg's safety.">

Asa and the speaker (Harriet) need to return to the settlement with the helicopter, which is their only means of transportation. They cannot find their way through the wilderness of bog without landmarks, and carrying the valuable egg on foot would be impossible due to Slider attacks and the distance to the settlement.

To help Asa and Harriet get back in the helicopter and fly it in the drizzle at night, they will have to address the challenges of the Sliders and the helicopter being stuck in the mud:&#10;   - Sliders: They plan to fight off any Sliders that come near the helicopter. Harriet knows how to handle the machine-gun on the helicopter, which may provide some protection. However, in the drizzle and at night, it would be difficult to see Sliders approaching until it's too late.&#10;   - Helicopter stuck in mud: Asa attempted to pull the rotor blade out of the mud but was unsuccessful due to its weight and the suction from the mud. They may need to find a way to free the rotor blades before they can fly the helicopter." target="The story does not provide explicit information on why some of the other muck men had not returned after being called in when the helicopter arrived for the first time. It can be inferred that they were called back to the settlement, but it is not specified whether they returned with the helicopter or not. The focus of the story shifts to Asa and Harriet's situation, and there is no further mention of the other muck men.

Asa's quest to keep the Slider eggs alive is complicated by this territorial behavior and the need to protect the eggs from both Sliders and other potential threats. In the story excerpt provided, Kershaw's method of handling Sliders focuses on using a pit as a safe space while attempting to collect eggs, but further methods may be needed to successfully preserve and transport them.">

This may require quick reflexes, physical strength, and the ability to call for backup when needed.&#10;* The possibility of being killed by a Slider, as the doctor from the Conversion Corps notes that they cannot guarantee a changeling's safety in their new environment and cannot make them like the sight of themselves.">

This suggests that she may be more independent, strong-willed, and unconventional compared to other girls from affluent families.&#10;2. Asa recognizes Harriet as Hazeltyne's daughter, indicating that he has had some interaction with her father or the family in the past.&#10;3. Harriet meets Asa's eye without fear or disgust, showing a degree of strength and curiosity. This implies that she is not easily intimidated and is interested in understanding the situation better.&#10;4. Asa feels certain, without proof, that Tom Dorr was the one who framed him for grand theft. He might suspect that Harriet, being Hazeltyne's daughter, could be unaware of her father or Dorr's potential involvement in illegal activities.&#10;5. When Asa learns that he will either get five years in prison or face a changeling deal (which implies a more severe punishment), his cellmate Jumpy advises him to take the five-year sentence. Asa's determination to protect the Slider egg, despite the risks involved, suggests that he values justice and integrity over his own safety. This trait might have caught Harriet's attention and admiration.&#10;6. Based on Asa's reactions in the courtroom, we can infer that Harriet is a strong, curious, and possibly unconventional young woman who may share some of Asa's values such as justice and integrity.">

The story does not provide explicit reasons for why Tom Dorr doesn't help lift Kershaw into the helicopter while Harriet Hazeltyne does. However, this could be due to various possible reasons:&#10;   - Dorr might consider himself too important or busy to assist in physically lifting Kershaw.&#10;   - There could be a gender dynamic at play, where the company culture or Dorr's personal beliefs make him less inclined to help a woman with physical labor compared to another man.&#10;   - Dorr may have wanted to maintain some distance from Asa and Kershaw, possibly due to his intentions regarding the egg or his role in the company.">

This includes informing them about the potential risks and dangers involved in changing their bodies to adapt to different environments, as well as their rights as changelings.&#10;2. The history of medical regeneration and specialized regrowth technology is closely related to the Conversion Corps, as these advancements made it possible to adapt humans to various environments, particularly those on other planets. Medical regeneration allowed for the growth of new cells and organs, while specialized regrowth techniques were developed to create humans capable of surviving in specific conditions. This technology was initially popular but later declared unethical due to the trend of deliberate deformities.&#10;&#10;In the context of the story, the Conversion Corps serves as a means for Asa to become a muck man and go to Jordan's Planet to hunt Slider eggs. The risks associated with this decision are significant, as he will have to adapt to the double gravity of Jordan's Planet and survive in its harsh environment for a year. Additionally, hunting Slider eggs will be a dangerous task due to the protective nature of the mother Slider and the attraction of other Sliders to the egg's light. However, this decision allows Asa to continue his work on keeping Slider eggs alive and potentially cause trouble for Hazeltyne, the company that framed him.">

    <node id="1. The &quot;sad chamber&quot; refers to Amelia's room where she had been in intense fear and anxiety about her husband's safety in the war, to the point that she had forgotten about everything else, including Rebecca.&#10;2. In this state of despair, Amelia had been on her knees for hours in prayer, a experience that is common to many widows and mothers during times of war. This aspect of war is often overlooked in the celebration of victory.&#10;3. The narrative highlights the fact that the experiences of these women, such as Amelia, are often not included in war chronicles which typically focus on fights and triumphs. Instead, the sadness, grief, and fears of those left behind are &quot;too mean parts of the pageant&quot; and go unheard in the midst of victory celebrations." />
    <node id=" and made her shrink&#10;back.  It recalled her to the world and the remembrance of yesterday.&#10;In the overpowering fears about to-morrow she had forgotten&#10;Rebecca--jealousy--everything except that her husband was gone and was&#10;in danger.  Until this dauntless worldling came in and broke the spell,&#10;and lifted the latch, we too have forborne to enter into that sad&#10;chamber.  How long had that poor girl been on her knees!  what hours of&#10;speechless prayer and bitter prostration had she passed there!  The&#10;war-chroniclers who write brilliant stories of fight and triumph&#10;scarcely tell us of these.  These are too mean parts of the pageant:&#10;and you don't hear widows' cries or mothers' sobs in the midst of the&#10;shouts and jubilation in the great Chorus of Victory.  And yet when was&#10;the time that such have not cried out: heart-broken, humble&#10;protestants, unheard in the uproar of the triumph!&#10;&#10;After the first movement of terror in Amelia's mind--when Rebecca's&#10;green eyes lighted upon her, and rustling in her fresh silks and&#10;br" />
    <node id=" the first movement of terror in Amelia's mind--when Rebecca's&#10;green eyes lighted upon her, and rustling in her fresh silks and&#10;brilliant ornaments, the latter tripped up with extended arms to&#10;embrace her--a feeling of anger succeeded, and from being deadly pale&#10;before, her face flushed up red, and she returned Rebecca's look after&#10;a moment with a steadiness which surprised and somewhat abashed her&#10;rival.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dearest Amelia, you are very unwell,&quot; the visitor said, putting forth&#10;her hand to take Amelia's.  &quot;What is it? I could not rest until I knew&#10;how you were.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia drew back her hand--never since her life began had that gentle&#10;soul refused to believe or to answer any demonstration of good-will or&#10;affection.  But she drew back her hand, and trembled all over.  &quot;Why&#10;are you here, Rebecca?&quot; she said, still looking at her solemnly with&#10;her large eyes.  These glances troubled her visitor.&#10;&#10;&quot;She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball,&quot; Rebecca&#10;thought.  &quot;Don't be agitated, dear Amelia,&quot; she said" />
    <node id=" at the bedside, where Rebecca had left her, and&#10;stood almost crazy with grief.  The Major's wife, a stronger-minded&#10;woman, endeavoured her best to comfort her young friend. &quot;You must bear&#10;up, Amelia, dear,&quot; she said kindly, &quot;for he mustn't find you ill when&#10;he sends for you after the victory.  It's not you are the only woman&#10;that are in the hands of God this day.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know that.  I am very wicked, very weak,&quot; Amelia said.  She knew her&#10;own weakness well enough.  The presence of the more resolute friend&#10;checked it, however; and she was the better of this control and&#10;company.  They went on till two o'clock; their hearts were with the&#10;column as it marched farther and farther away.  Dreadful doubt and&#10;anguish--prayers and fears and griefs unspeakable--followed the&#10;regiment.  It was the women's tribute to the war.  It taxes both alike,&#10;and takes the blood of the men, and the tears of the women.&#10;&#10;At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr. Joseph:" />

He&#10;too wanted to fly, and was on the look-out for the means of escape. &quot;HE&#10;shall buy my horses,&quot; thought Rebecca, &quot;and I'll ride the mare.&quot;&#10;&#10;Jos walked up to his friend, and put the question for the hundredth&#10;time during the past hour, &quot;Did she know where horses were to be had?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What, YOU fly?&quot; said Rebecca, with a laugh.  &quot;I thought you were the&#10;champion of all the ladies, Mr. Sedley.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I--I'm not a military man,&quot; gasped he.&#10;&#10;&quot;And Amelia?--Who is to protect that poor little sister of yours?&quot;&#10;asked Rebecca.  &quot;You surely would not desert her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What good can I do her, suppose--suppose the enemy arrive?&quot; Jos&#10;answered.  &quot;They'll spare the women; but my man tells me that they have&#10;taken an oath to give no quarter to the men--the dastardly cowards.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Horrid!&quot; cried Rebecca" />
    <node id=" communicate it to the ladies under his charge. He did not&#10;think it was necessary to tell them how he had intended to take leave&#10;of them, how he had bought horses, and what a price he had paid for&#10;them.&#10;&#10;But success or defeat was a minor matter to them, who had only thought&#10;for the safety of those they loved. Amelia, at the news of the victory,&#10;became still more agitated even than before.  She was for going that&#10;moment to the army.  She besought her brother with tears to conduct her&#10;thither.  Her doubts and terrors reached their paroxysm; and the poor&#10;girl, who for many hours had been plunged into stupor, raved and ran&#10;hither and thither in hysteric insanity--a piteous sight.  No man&#10;writhing in pain on the hard-fought field fifteen miles off, where lay,&#10;after their struggles, so many of the brave--no man suffered more&#10;keenly than this poor harmless victim of the war.  Jos could not bear&#10;the sight of her pain.  He left his sister in the charge of her stouter&#10;female companion, and descended once more to" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball,&quot; Rebecca&#10;thought.  &quot;Don't be agitated, dear Amelia,&quot; she said, looking down. &quot;I&#10;came but to see if I could--if you were well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you well?&quot; said Amelia.  &quot;I dare say you are. You don't love your&#10;husband.  You would not be here if you did.  Tell me, Rebecca, did I&#10;ever do you anything but kindness?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed, Amelia, no,&quot; the other said, still hanging down her head.&#10;&#10;&quot;When you were quite poor, who was it that befriended you?  Was I not a&#10;sister to you?  You saw us all in happier days before he married me.  I&#10;was all in all then to him; or would he have given up his fortune, his&#10;family, as he nobly did to make me happy?  Why did you come between my&#10;love and me?  Who sent you to separate those whom God joined, and take&#10;my darling's heart from me--my own husband? Do you think you could&#10;love him as I did?  His love was everything to me." />
    <node id="Rebecca's motive for setting a high price on her horses and making Jos pay a significant amount of money, despite promising Lord Bareacres to sell them for the same price, was primarily driven by her assessment of Jos's eagerness to purchase and the scarcity of the article. She recognized that Jos was desperate to find horses for his family's escape and took advantage of this situation to maximize her financial gain. Additionally, she saw an opportunity to further humiliate her enemies, the Bareacres family, by keeping them in a horseless carriage while selling her horses to Jos. Overall, Rebecca's actions were motivated by her desire for financial security and personal satisfaction at the expense of others." />
    <node id=" Rebecca.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you think he is up to my weight?&quot; Jos said.  He was already on his&#10;back, in imagination, without ever so much as a thought for poor&#10;Amelia.  What person who loved a horse-speculation could resist such a&#10;temptation?&#10;&#10;In reply, Rebecca asked him to come into her room, whither he followed&#10;her quite breathless to conclude the bargain.  Jos seldom spent a&#10;half-hour in his life which cost him so much money. Rebecca, measuring&#10;the value of the goods which she had for sale by Jos's eagerness to&#10;purchase, as well as by the scarcity of the article, put upon her&#10;horses a price so prodigious as to make even the civilian draw back.&#10;&quot;She would sell both or neither,&quot; she said, resolutely.  Rawdon had&#10;ordered her not to part with them for a price less than that which she&#10;specified. Lord Bareacres below would give her the same money--and with&#10;all her love and regard for the Sedley family, her dear Mr. Joseph must&#10;conceive that poor people must live--nobody, in a word, could be more&#10;affectionate" />
    <node id="and her husband were sent once more through the town, each to look for&#10;cattle; and woe betide those who came last!  Her Ladyship was resolved&#10;on departing the very instant the horses arrived from any quarter--with&#10;her husband or without him.&#10;&#10;Rebecca had the pleasure of seeing her Ladyship in the horseless&#10;carriage, and keeping her eyes fixed upon her, and bewailing, in the&#10;loudest tone of voice, the Countess's perplexities.  &quot;Not to be able to&#10;get horses!&quot; she said, &quot;and to have all those diamonds sewed into the&#10;carriage cushions!  What a prize it will be for the French when they&#10;come!--the carriage and the diamonds, I mean; not the lady!&quot; She gave&#10;this information to the landlord, to the servants, to the guests, and&#10;the innumerable stragglers about the courtyard.  Lady Bareacres could&#10;have shot her from the carriage window.&#10;&#10;It was while enjoying the humiliation of her enemy that Rebecca caught&#10;sight of Jos, who made towards her directly he perceived her.&#10;&#10;That altered, frightened, fat face, told his secret well enough.  He" />
    <node id=" that they have&#10;taken an oath to give no quarter to the men--the dastardly cowards.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Horrid!&quot; cried Rebecca, enjoying his perplexity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Besides, I don't want to desert her,&quot; cried the brother. &quot;She SHAN'T&#10;be deserted.  There is a seat for her in my carriage, and one for you,&#10;dear Mrs. Crawley, if you will come; and if we can get horses--&quot; sighed&#10;he--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have two to sell,&quot; the lady said.  Jos could have flung himself into&#10;her arms at the news.  &quot;Get the carriage, Isidor,&quot; he cried; &quot;we've&#10;found them--we have found them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My horses never were in harness,&quot; added the lady. &quot;Bullfinch would kick&#10;the carriage to pieces, if you put him in the traces.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But he is quiet to ride?&quot; asked the civilian.&#10;&#10;&quot;As quiet as a lamb, and as fast as a hare,&quot; answered Rebecca.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you think he is up to my weight?&quot; Jos said.

    <node id="ley family, her dear Mr. Joseph must&#10;conceive that poor people must live--nobody, in a word, could be more&#10;affectionate, but more firm about the matter of business.&#10;&#10;Jos ended by agreeing, as might be supposed of him. The sum he had to&#10;give her was so large that he was obliged to ask for time; so large as&#10;to be a little fortune to Rebecca, who rapidly calculated that with&#10;this sum, and the sale of the residue of Rawdon's effects, and her&#10;pension as a widow should he fall, she would now be absolutely&#10;independent of the world, and might look her weeds steadily in the face.&#10;&#10;Once or twice in the day she certainly had herself thought about&#10;flying.  But her reason gave her better counsel.  &quot;Suppose the French&#10;do come,&quot; thought Becky, &quot;what can they do to a poor officer's widow?&#10;Bah!  the times of sacks and sieges are over.  We shall be let to go&#10;home quietly, or I may live pleasantly abroad with a snug little&#10;income.&quot;&#10;&#10;Meanwhile Jos and Isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly&#10;purchased cattle" />
    <node id=" pleasantly abroad with a snug little&#10;income.&quot;&#10;&#10;Meanwhile Jos and Isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly&#10;purchased cattle.  Jos bade his man saddle the horses at once. He would&#10;ride away that very night, that very hour.  And he left the valet busy&#10;in getting the horses ready, and went homewards himself to prepare for&#10;his departure.  It must be secret.  He would go to his chamber by the&#10;back entrance.  He did not care to face Mrs. O'Dowd and Amelia, and own&#10;to them that he was about to run.&#10;&#10;By the time Jos's bargain with Rebecca was completed, and his horses&#10;had been visited and examined, it was almost morning once more.  But&#10;though midnight was long passed, there was no rest for the city; the&#10;people were up, the lights in the houses flamed, crowds were still&#10;about the doors, and the streets were busy.  Rumours of various natures&#10;went still from mouth to mouth:  one report averred that the Prussians&#10;had been utterly defeated; another that it was the English who had been&#10;attacked and conquered: " />
    <node id="Jos's secretive departure from Rebecca's place amidst the rumors in the city at midnight is related to his purchase of horses from Rebecca. He plans to leave town immediately to escape the approaching enemy, who have reportedly taken an oath to give no quarter to men. He is also concerned about the safety of his sister, Amelia. Rebecca's offer of her horses for sale provides Jos with a means of escape, and he is eager to purchase them despite their high price." />
    <node id=" Rebecca.  &quot;He makes me miserable about you.&#10;And whatever it might have been once--my heart is all his.  I am&#10;innocent now.  Am I not, Mr. Sedley?&quot;&#10;&#10;All Jos's blood tingled with delight, as he surveyed this victim to his&#10;attractions.  A few adroit words, one or two knowing tender glances of&#10;the eyes, and his heart was inflamed again and his doubts and&#10;suspicions forgotten.  From Solomon downwards, have not wiser men than&#10;he been cajoled and befooled by women?  &quot;If the worst comes to the&#10;worst,&quot; Becky thought, &quot;my retreat is secure; and I have a right-hand&#10;seat in the barouche.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is no knowing into what declarations of love and ardour the&#10;tumultuous passions of Mr. Joseph might have led him, if Isidor the&#10;valet had not made his reappearance at this minute, and begun to busy&#10;himself about the domestic affairs.

    <node id="The town of Brussels was in a state of panic and anticipation as French partisans prophesied the imminent arrival of Napoleon, their Emperor. The partisans claimed that Napoleon had cut the allied armies in two and was marching straight on Brussels, predicting that he would overpower the English and arrive that very night. These prophecies caused a wave of alarm and clamor among the townspeople. Merchants closed their shops and joined the crowds, women flocked to churches to pray, and carriages with travelers started leaving the town, all while the distant sound of cannons echoed through the streets. As these rumors spread, Jos Sedley, a stout civilian, grew increasingly anxious and fearful for his life and the safety of Brussels. People in the city believed that one of the armies opposing Napoleon had already been scattered and that the few English troops resisting him would perish, leading to the conquest of Brussels. This atmosphere of panic was further fueled by letters from Montmirail, warning of the horrors that prisoners in England had suffered and predicting a similar fate for those who opposed the French Emperor." />
    <node id="of the French went abroad, wild with excitement, and prophesying the&#10;triumph of their Emperor.  The merchants closed their shops, and came&#10;out to swell the general chorus of alarm and clamour.  Women rushed to&#10;the churches, and crowded the chapels, and knelt and prayed on the&#10;flags and steps.  The dull sound of the cannon went on rolling,&#10;rolling.  Presently carriages with travellers began to leave the town,&#10;galloping away by the Ghent barrier.  The prophecies of the French&#10;partisans began to pass for facts.  &quot;He has cut the armies in two,&quot; it&#10;was said.  &quot;He is marching straight on Brussels.  He will overpower the&#10;English, and be here to-night.&quot; &quot;He will overpower the English,&quot;&#10;shrieked Isidor to his master, &quot;and will be here to-night.&quot; The man&#10;bounded in and out from the lodgings to the street, always returning&#10;with some fresh particulars of disaster.  Jos's face grew paler and&#10;paler. Alarm began to take entire possession of the stout civilian.&#10;All the champagne he drank brought no courage to him.  Before sunset he" />
    <node id="ated&#10;the Prussians, and was now free to bring his whole force to bear upon&#10;the allies. The Duke of Wellington was retreating upon the capital, and&#10;a great battle must be fought under its walls probably, of which the&#10;chances were more than doubtful. The Duke of Wellington had but twenty&#10;thousand British troops on whom he could rely, for the Germans were raw&#10;militia, the Belgians disaffected, and with this handful his Grace had&#10;to resist a hundred and fifty thousand men that had broken into Belgium&#10;under Napoleon.  Under Napoleon!  What warrior was there, however&#10;famous and skilful, that could fight at odds with him?&#10;&#10;Jos thought of all these things, and trembled.  So did all the rest of&#10;Brussels--where people felt that the fight of the day before was but&#10;the prelude to the greater combat which was imminent.  One of the&#10;armies opposed to the Emperor was scattered to the winds already.  The&#10;few English that could be brought to resist him would perish at their&#10;posts, and the conqueror would pass over their bodies into the city.&#10;Woe be to those whom he found there! Addresses were" />

Madmen!  a moment&#10;of prosperity has blinded them, and if they enter into France it will&#10;be to find a grave there!&quot;  But the partisans of the French prophesied&#10;a more speedy extermination of the Emperor's enemies than this; and it&#10;was agreed on all hands that Prussians and British would never return&#10;except as prisoners in the rear of the conquering army.&#10;&#10;These opinions in the course of the day were brought to operate upon&#10;Mr. Sedley.  He was told that the Duke of Wellington had gone to try&#10;and rally his army, the advance of which had been utterly crushed the&#10;night before.&#10;&#10;&quot;Crushed, psha!&quot; said Jos, whose heart was pretty stout at&#10;breakfast-time.  &quot;The Duke has gone to beat the Emperor as he has&#10;beaten all his generals before.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;His papers are burned, his effects are removed, and his quarters are&#10;being got ready for the Duke of Dalmatia,&quot; Jos's informant replied.  &quot;I&#10;had it" />

A thousand pale and anxious faces might&#10;have been seen looking from other casements.  And presently it seemed&#10;as if the whole population of the city rushed into the streets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In Which Jos Takes Flight, and the War Is Brought to a Close&#10;&#10;We of peaceful London City have never beheld--and please God never&#10;shall witness--such a scene of hurry and alarm, as that which Brussels&#10;presented.  Crowds rushed to the Namur gate, from which direction the&#10;noise proceeded, and many rode along the level chaussee, to be in&#10;advance of any intelligence from the army.  Each man asked his&#10;neighbour for news; and even great English lords and ladies&#10;condescended to speak to persons whom they did not know.  The friends&#10;of the French went abroad, wild with excitement, and prophesying the&#10;triumph of their Emperor.  The merchants closed their shops, and came&#10;out" />
    <node id=" English were congregated, and&#10;there mingled with other valets, couriers, and lackeys, gathered such&#10;news as was abroad, and brought back bulletins for his master's&#10;information.  Almost all these gentlemen were in heart partisans of the&#10;Emperor, and had their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign.&#10;The Emperor's proclamation from Avesnes had been distributed everywhere&#10;plentifully in Brussels.  &quot;Soldiers!&quot;  it said, &quot;this is the&#10;anniversary of Marengo and Friedland, by which the destinies of Europe&#10;were twice decided.  Then, as after Austerlitz, as after Wagram, we&#10;were too generous.  We believed in the oaths and promises of princes&#10;whom we suffered to remain upon their thrones.

All day long, whilst the women were praying ten miles away, the&#10;lines of the dauntless English infantry were receiving and repelling&#10;the furious charges of the French horsemen.  Guns which were heard at&#10;Brussels were ploughing up their ranks, and comrades falling, and the&#10;resolute survivors closing in.  Towards evening, the attack of the&#10;French, repeated and resisted so bravely, slackened in its fury.  They&#10;had other foes besides the British to engage, or were preparing for a&#10;final onset.  It came at last:  the columns of the Imperial Guard&#10;marched up the hill of Saint Jean, at length and at once to sweep the&#10;English from the height which they had maintained all day, and spite of&#10;all:  unscared by the thunder" />

He pleased himself by noting down with a&#10;pencil, in his big schoolboy handwriting, the various items of his&#10;portable property which might be sold for his widow's advantage as, for&#10;example, &quot;My double-barril by Manton, say 40 guineas; my driving cloak,&#10;lined with sable fur, 50 pounds; my duelling pistols in rosewood case&#10;(same which I shot Captain Marker), 20 pounds; my regulation&#10;saddle-holsters and housings; my Laurie ditto,&quot; and so forth, over all&#10;of which articles he made Rebecca the mistress.&#10;&#10;Faithful to his plan of economy, the Captain dressed himself in his&#10;oldest and shabbiest uniform and epaulets, leaving the newest behind,&#10;under his wife's (or it might" />

The Countess herself actually came to wait&#10;upon Mrs. Crawley on the failure of her second envoy.  She entreated&#10;her to name her own price; she even offered to invite Becky to&#10;Bareacres House, if the latter would but give her the means of&#10;returning to that residence.

When there is nobody else in the way she&#10;can think about old Joseph Sedley!&quot;  But besides these doubts he felt&#10;flattered at the idea Rebecca expressed of his courage.&#10;&#10;He blushed a good deal, and put on an air of importance. &quot;I should like&#10;to see the action,&quot; he said.  &quot;Every man of any spirit would, you know.&#10;I've seen a little service in India, but nothing on this grand scale.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You men would sacrifice anything for a pleasure,&quot; Rebecca answered.&#10;&quot;Captain Crawley left me this morning as gay as if he were going to a&#10;hunting party.

My Lady Bareacres cut Mrs. Crawley on the stairs when they met&#10;by chance; and in all places where the latter's name was mentioned,&#10;spoke perseveringly ill of her neighbour.  The Countess was shocked at&#10;the familiarity of General Tufto with the aide-de-camp's wife.  The&#10;Lady Blanche avoided her as if she had been an infectious disease.&#10;Only the Earl himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her,&#10;when out of the jurisdiction of his ladies.&#10;&#10;Rebecca had her revenge now upon these insolent enemies.

During the battle, as Ney and his troops advanced, Regulus and his comrades showed great activity in retreating before the French, being dislodged from one post after another. Their movements were only halted by the advance of the British in their rear. The enemy's cavalry then had an opportunity to engage with the brave Belgians, who preferred to face the British rather than the French, and they turned tail and rode through the English regiments behind them, causing chaos and scattering in all directions.

Their movements were only checked by the advance of the British&#10;in their rear.

In the best French which he could muster, and which&#10;was in sooth of a very ungrammatical sort, Jos besought the hussar to&#10;tell his tale.  The disasters deepened as Regulus spoke.  He was the&#10;only man of his regiment not slain on the field. He had seen the Duke&#10;of Brunswick fall, the black hussars fly, the Ecossais pounded down by&#10;the cannon. &quot;And the --th?&quot; gasped Jos.&#10;&#10;&quot;Cut in pieces,&quot; said the hussar--upon which Pauline cried out," />

Many scores of&#10;Regulus's comrades had found their way back to Brussels, and all&#10;agreeing that they had run away--filled the whole town with an idea of&#10;the defeat of the allies.  The arrival of the French was expected&#10;hourly; the panic continued, and preparations for flight went on&#10;everywhere.  No horses!  thought Jos, in terror.

This&#10;lover was a native of Brussels, and a Belgian hussar.  The troops of&#10;his nation signalised themselves in this war for anything but courage,&#10;and young Van Cutsum, Pauline's admirer, was too good a soldier to&#10;disobey his Colonel's orders to run away. Whilst in garrison at&#10;Brussels young Regulus (he had been born in the revolutionary times)&#10;found his great comfort, and passed almost all his leisure moments, in&#10;Pauline's kitchen; and it was with pockets and holsters crammed full of&#10;good things from her larder, that he had take leave of his weeping&#10;sweetheart, to proceed upon the campaign a few days before.&#10;&#10;As far as his regiment was concerned, this campaign was over now.

The&#10;regiment in fact did not exist any more.  It was nowhere.  It had no&#10;head-quarters.

    <node id="The Emperor's proclamation to the soldiers in Brussels is significant because it serves as a rallying cry, reminding them of past military victories at Marengo, Friedland, Jena, Montmirail, and Austerlitz. Napoleon implies that they were too generous in their dealings with princes after those battles, allowing them to remain on their thrones despite broken oaths and promises. The proclamation is distributed widely in Brussels, and the gathered valets, couriers, and lackeys (who are mostly partisans of the Emperor) discuss it among themselves, expressing their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign. Their sentiments reflect the general excitement and confidence among French supporters, who believe that Napoleon will soon triumph over the Prussians and other allied forces. The proclamation also serves to boost morale among the soldiers by emphasizing their past victories under Napoleon's leadership and hinting at a possible repeat of those successes." />

    <node id="The events of that night and the following day are marked by warfare and concern for loved ones. After spending the night tending to Amelia and Rawdon, Mrs. Major O'Dowd returns to her billet where she performs an elaborate toilette and possibly says a prayer for her husband's wellbeing, indicating her love and worry for him amidst the chaos of war.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Amelia receives news about her husband through a wounded soldier being cared for in her room. The young patient shares the regiment's losses, including the Major's horse being shot and how he was later found on Pyramus's carcase with a case-bottle.

And Mrs. Major O'Dowd had the satisfaction&#10;of seeing both her patients refreshed in health and spirits by some&#10;rest which they had taken during the night.  She herself had slept on a&#10;great chair in Amelia's room, ready to wait upon her poor friend or the&#10;ensign, should either need her nursing. When morning came, this robust&#10;woman went back to the house where she and her Major had their billet;&#10;and here performed an elaborate and splendid toilette, befitting the&#10;day.  And it is very possible that whilst alone in that chamber, which&#10;her husband had inhabited, and where his cap still lay on the pillow,&#10;and his cane stood in the corner, one prayer at least was sent up to&#10;Heaven for the welfare of the brave soldier, Michael O'Dowd.&#10;" />

The young patient told in his simple fashion the events of&#10;the day, and the actions of our friends of the gallant --th.  They had&#10;suffered severely.

Once or twice he had&#10;ventured into his sister's bedroom, looking very much alarmed, and as&#10;if he would say something.  But the Major's wife kept her place, and he&#10;went away without disburthening himself of his speech.  He was ashamed&#10;to tell her that he wanted to fly.&#10;&#10;But when she made her appearance in the dining-room, where he sate in&#10;the twilight in the cheerless company of his empty champagne bottles,&#10;he began to open his mind to her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. O'Dowd,&quot; he said, &quot;hadn't you better get Amelia ready?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you going to take her out for a walk?&quot; said the Major's lady;&#10;&quot;sure she's too weak to stir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I--I've ordered the carriage,&quot; he said, &quot;and--and post" />

And this time he really gave his order for&#10;march:  and mounted in the court-yard.  Mrs. O'Dowd heard the&#10;clattering hoofs of the horses as they issued from the gate; and&#10;looking on, made many scornful remarks on poor Joseph as he rode down&#10;the street with Isidor after him in the laced cap.  The horses, which&#10;had not been exercised for some days, were lively, and sprang about the&#10;street.  Jos, a clumsy and timid horseman, did not look to advantage in&#10;the saddle.  &quot;Look at him, Amelia dear, driving into the parlour&#10;window.  Such a bull in a china-shop I never saw.&quot; And presently the&#10;pair of riders disappeared at a canter down the street leading in the&#10;direction of the Ghent road, Mrs. O'Dowd pursuing them with a fire" />

And it was Captain&#10;Dobbin who at the end of the day, though wounded himself, took up the&#10;lad in his arms and carried him to the surgeon, and thence to the cart&#10;which was to bring him back to Brussels.  And it was he who promised&#10;the driver two louis if he would make his way to Mr. Sedley's hotel in&#10;the city; and tell Mrs. Captain Osborne that the action was over, and&#10;that her husband was unhurt and well.&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed, but he has a good heart that William Dobbin,&quot; Mrs. O'Dowd&#10;said, &quot;though he is always laughing at me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Young Stubble vowed there was not such another officer in the army, and&#10;never ceased his praises of the senior captain, his modesty, his&#10;kindness, and his admirable coolness in the field.

    <node id="Rebecca set a high price on her horses when negotiating with Jos primarily because she recognized his desperation to find horses for his family's escape during wartime. She also knew that her horses were scarce and could be sold at a higher price. This decision reflected her financial situation as she was looking to maximize her financial gain by taking advantage of the situation. Regarding her loyalty to the Sedley family, Rebecca had no genuine affection for them, despite selling the horses to Jos at Lord Bareacres's agreed-upon price. She only pretended to be affectionate towards the Sedleys to further humiliate her enemies, the Bareacres family, who were also in dire need of horses but were kept horseless while Rebecca sold hers to Jos." />

She had tied it round her waist&#10;at some part of the day.  She had forgotten her anger, her jealousy,&#10;the very presence of her rival seemingly.  For she walked silently and&#10;almost with a smile on her face, towards the bed, and began to smooth&#10;down George's pillow.&#10;&#10;Rebecca walked, too, silently away.  &quot;How is Amelia?&quot; asked Jos, who&#10;still held his position in the chair.&#10;&#10;&quot;There should be somebody with her,&quot; said Rebecca. &quot;I think she is very&#10;unwell&quot;:  and she went away with a very grave face, refusing Mr.&#10;Sedley's entreaties that she would stay and partake of the early dinner&#10;which he had ordered.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was of a good-natured and obliging disposition; and she liked&#10;Amelia" />

    <node id="When Jos's patience was exhausted, he said goodbye to his wife Amelia and left the house in a rage. He had reached the end of his tolerance for a situation where Amelia kept talking about her love for Major O'Dowd. Jos mounted his horse and rode away with Isidor following him on a horse that hadn't been exercised for several days, making it lively and difficult to control. The horses were spirited, and since Jos was a clumsy and timid horseman, he didn't look very confident in the saddle. As they rode away from the house, Mrs. O'Dowd watched them leave and made scornful remarks about Jos's poor horse riding skills, mentioning how he almost drove into the parlor window with his lack of control over the animal." />

I've just got her to lie down.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Get her up,&quot; said Jos; &quot;she must get up, I say&quot;:  and he stamped his&#10;foot energetically.  &quot;I say the horses are ordered--yes, the horses are&#10;ordered.  It's all over, and--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what?&quot; asked Mrs. O'Dowd.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm off for Ghent,&quot; Jos answered.  &quot;Everybody is going; there's a&#10;place for you!  We shall start in half-an-hour.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Major's wife looked at him with infinite scorn.  &quot;I don't move till&#10;O'Dowd gives me the route,&quot; said she. &quot;You may go if you like, Mr.&#10;Sedley; but, faith, Amelia and I stop here.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />

The windows of the room were open, and looked&#10;southward, and a dull distant sound came over the sun-lighted roofs&#10;from that direction.  &quot;What is it?&quot; said Jos.  &quot;Why don't you pour, you&#10;rascal?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Cest le feu!&quot; said Isidor, running to the balcony.&#10;&#10;&quot;God defend us; it's cannon" />

She also performs an elaborate toilette and possibly says a prayer for her husband's wellbeing amidst the chaos of war. Her actions reflect piety, just like the simultaneous events occurring in twenty thousand churches across Britain, where millions of British men and women pray for protection during the ongoing conflict. The collective prayers of these congregations mirror Mrs. O'Dowd's individual prayer, emphasizing the theme of widespread concern and unity among the characters during times of distress." />

How often has my&#10;Mick listened to these sermons, she thought, and me reading in the&#10;cabin of a calm!  She proposed to resume this exercise on the present&#10;day, with Amelia and the wounded ensign for a congregation.

    <node id="1. Change of Clothes: After her companion's departure, the woman changes out of her fine dress into a simple and more subdued outfit. This change reflects her new circumstances and her need to be practical in light of potential danger or hardship. It also symbolizes a shift in her priorities, as she is no longer concerned with appearances but rather focusing on functionality.&#10;&#10;2. Discovery of a Note: While changing clothes, the woman discovers a note left behind by her companion. The contents of the note are not specified, but it seems to contain important information or instructions that affect their future plans. The discovery of this note prompts her to reflect on the significance of its contents and how they might need to adjust their actions going forward.&#10;&#10;3. Brief Mourning: The woman takes a moment to mourn the absence of her companion, indicating a deep emotional attachment between them. This could be due to feelings of love, friendship, or even a sense of shared purpose. Her brief mourning serves as a reminder of the human connections that often underlie larger plans and ambitions.&#10;&#10;4. Financial Plans: Despite the challenges posed by her companion's departure and the potential dangers ahead, the woman remains committed to their financial plans. She reviews their assets, including jewels, cash, and other valuables, in order to assess their current situation and make informed decisions about how best to proceed. This demonstrates her resilience, determination, and resourcefulness in the face of adversity.&#10;&#10;Overall, the woman's actions and reflections after her companion's departure showcase her ability to adapt to changing circumstances, maintain emotional stability, and remain focused on their shared goals. Her practical approach to dressing, careful consideration of the note's contents, brief moment of mourning, and continued pursuit of their financial plans all highlight her strength of character and dedication to their cause." />

Should the worst befall, all&#10;things considered, she was pretty well to do.  There were her own&#10;trinkets and trousseau, in addition to those which her husband had left&#10;behind. Rawdon's generosity, when they were first married, has already&#10;been described and lauded.  Besides these, and the little mare, the&#10;General, her slave and worshipper, had made her many very handsome&#10;presents, in the shape of cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a&#10;bankrupt French general's lady, and numerous tributes from the&#10;jewellers' shops, all of which betokened her admirer's taste and&#10;wealth.

Then he looked amazed at the pale face in the glass&#10;before him, and especially at his mustachios, which had attained a rich&#10;growth in the course of near seven weeks, since they had come into the&#10;world.  They WILL mistake me for a military man, thought he,&#10;remembering Isidor's warning as to the massacre with which all the&#10;defeated British army was threatened; and staggering back to his&#10;bedchamber, he began wildly pulling the bell which summoned his valet.&#10;&#10;Isidor answered that summons.  Jos had sunk in a chair--he had torn off&#10;his neckcloths, and turned down his collars, and was sitting with both&#10;his hands lifted to his throat.&#10;&#10;&quot;Coupez-moi, Isidor,&quot; shouted he; &quot;vite!

    <node id="1. The woman's own assets: Based on the narrative, she has her &quot;own trinkets and trousseau,&quot; as well as &quot;jewels&quot; and &quot;watches&quot; given by her husband. These personal assets would contribute to her financial situation following her husband's death.&#10;2. Her husband's leftover assets: The woman mentions that she has inherited her husband's portable property, which includes the &quot;newest uniform&quot; left behind and other unspecified belongings. This property would also add to her financial resources.&#10;3. Gifts from her slave and worshipper: She has received numerous presents from the General, including &quot;cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a bankrupt French general's lady&quot; and &quot;tributes from the jewellers' shops.&quot; These valuable gifts would significantly boost her financial standing.&#10;4. Watches given by her husband: Although there is no explicit mention of the value of these watches, they were likely expensive since one of them was of English workmanship and had been replaced due to its poor performance. The collection of watches would add to her assets.&#10;5. Overall, considering all these sources, the woman is described as &quot;pretty well to do&quot; in terms of finances following her husband's death. She has inherited personal belongings from her husband, received valuable gifts from her slave and worshipper, and benefited from her husband's generosity during their marriage through items such as jewels and watches." />
    <node id="When Jos Sedley is left in command of the &quot;colony&quot; in Brussels, it refers to him being responsible for taking care of his sick sister, Amelia. Their superior officers have been summoned elsewhere due to military duties, leaving Jos as the highest-ranking male in their immediate social circle. Jos feels relieved about George's absence, as he no longer has to play a secondary role in the household and is free from George's contemptuous behavior. He also feels duty-bound to stay with Amelia, but his true feelings are suggested when he purchases horses from Rebecca to escape the approaching enemy, showing that he is concerned about his own safety as well. The situation in Brussels is tense due to the rumors of an impending attack by the enemy, and people are frightened for their loved ones who have gone to fight." />

    <node id="Based on the supporting materials provided, the officer who demonstrated exceptional bravery and kindness during the battle was Captain William Dobbin. He displayed his courage by cutting down a French lancer who had speared an ensign, and later showed his kindness by taking the wounded ensign to a surgeon and arranging for the ensign's wife to be informed of his condition. The character traits of bravery, kindness, modesty, and coolness in the field are attributed to Captain Dobbin in the narrative." />
    <node id="chance he had ever played compared to this one? Into all contests&#10;requiring athletic skill and courage, the young man, from his boyhood&#10;upwards, had flung himself with all his might. The champion of his&#10;school and his regiment, the bravos of his companions had followed him&#10;everywhere; from the boys' cricket-match to the garrison-races, he had&#10;won a hundred of triumphs; and wherever he went women and men had&#10;admired and envied him.  What qualities are there for which a man gets&#10;so speedy a return of applause, as those of bodily superiority,&#10;activity, and valour? Time out of mind strength and courage have been&#10;the theme of bards and romances; and from the story of Troy down to&#10;to-day, poetry has always chosen a soldier for a hero.  I wonder is it&#10;because men are cowards in heart that they admire bravery so much, and&#10;place military valour so far beyond every other quality for reward and&#10;worship?&#10;&#10;So, at the sound of that stirring call to battle, George jumped away&#10;from the gentle arms in which he had been dallying; not without a&#10;feeling of shame" />
    <node id="The stout Major's wife, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in the narrative, played a significant role during the alarm caused by the approaching French army. When she heard the noise of cannonading, she immediately thought of her friend Amelia and went to console her. Her natural courage was heightened by the responsibility of protecting the &quot;helpless and gentle creature,&quot; as she referred to Amelia. She stayed with Amelia for five hours, offering words of comfort, encouragement, and silent prayers.&#10;&#10;Pauline, the bonne (servant), had a Belgian hussar lover named Regulus Van Cutsum who was fighting in the war. When Pauline heard the cannonading, she went to church to pray for her loved one. After returning from church, she was frightened to find her haggard hussar at the kitchen door. Despite her initial terror, she welcomed him with open arms, showing her unwavering loyalty and love towards him.&#10;&#10;Both women demonstrated resilience and courage in the face of danger. The stout Major's wife provided emotional support to Amelia, helping her cope with the anxiety and fear caused by the war. Pauline, on the other hand, showed bravery by welcoming her lover despite his disheveled appearance and the chaos that surrounded them. Their experiences during the alarm highlight their strength and commitment to those they care about." />

After hearing the firing for a&#10;moment, the stout Major's wife bethought her of her friend in the next&#10;chamber, and ran in to watch, and if possible to console, Amelia.  The&#10;idea that she had that helpless and gentle creature to protect, gave&#10;additional strength to the natural courage of the honest Irishwoman.&#10;She passed five hours by her friend's side, sometimes in remonstrance,&#10;sometimes talking cheerfully, oftener in silence and terrified mental&#10;supplication.  &quot;I never let go her hand once,&quot; said the stout lady&#10;afterwards, &quot;until after sunset, when the firing was over.&quot; Pauline,&#10;the bonne, was on her knees at church hard by, praying for son homme a&#10;elle.&#10;&#10;When the noise of the cannonading was" />

So, seizing a candle, he looked about for his&#10;gold-laced cap, and found it lying in its usual place, on a&#10;console-table, in the anteroom, placed before a mirror at which Jos&#10;used to coquet, always giving his side-locks a twirl, and his cap the&#10;proper cock over his eye, before he went forth to make appearance" />
    <node id="1. Dowd's meditation on her uncle's sermons was a source of comfort for her, particularly during times of distress such as when she was nearly wrecked on a ship coming home from the West Indies.&#10;2. After her husband's departure, she turned to this volume once again for reflection and solace. Her thoughts may have been elsewhere, but the act of meditation itself provided some level of comfort.&#10;3. This reflects the experience of those left behind during wartime as they often turn to prayer or meditation as a means of coping with their anxieties and fears. The collective prayers of congregations across Britain, as mentioned in the supporting materials, further emphasize this theme of piety and unity amidst distress.&#10;4. Furthermore, Dowd's meditation on her uncle's sermons highlights the importance of spirituality during wartime, illustrating how such practices can provide a sense of stability and hope in the face of uncertainty and danger.&#10;5. The fact that she found solace in these sermons also indicates her strong faith and belief in divine intervention, which could have helped her endure the hardships of war and the separation from her husband." />
    <node id="Dowd used to read&#10;with great gravity out of a large volume of her uncle the Dean's&#10;sermons.  It had been of great comfort to her on board the transport as&#10;they were coming home, and were very nearly wrecked, on their return&#10;from the West Indies.  After the regiment's departure she betook&#10;herself to this volume for meditation; perhaps she did not understand&#10;much of what she was reading, and her thoughts were elsewhere:  but the&#10;sleep project, with poor Mick's nightcap there on the pillow, was quite&#10;a vain one.  So it is in the world.

As she entered and closed the door on herself, he sank down&#10;in a chair, and gazed and sighed and puffed portentously.  &quot;That coat&#10;is very tight for Milor,&quot; Isidor said, still having his eye on the&#10;frogs; but his master heard him not: his thoughts were elsewhere:  now&#10;glowing, maddening, upon the contemplation of the enchanting Rebecca:&#10;anon shrinking guiltily before the vision of the jealous Rawdon&#10;Crawley, with his curling, fierce mustachios, and his terrible duelling&#10;pistols loaded and cocked.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's appearance struck Amelia with terror, and made her shrink&#10;back.

As long as there was an English&#10;army between Brussels and Napoleon, there was no need of immediate&#10;flight; but he had his horses brought from their distant stables, to&#10;the stables in the court-yard of the hotel where he lived; so that they&#10;might be under his own eyes, and beyond the risk of violent abduction.&#10;Isidor watched the stable-door constantly, and had the horses saddled,&#10;to be ready for the start. He longed intensely for that event.&#10;&#10;After the reception of the previous day, Rebecca did not care to come&#10;near her dear Amelia.  She clipped the bouquet which George had brought&#10;her, and gave fresh water to the flowers, and read over the letter&#10;which he had sent her.  &quot;Poor wretch,&quot; she said, twirling round the&#10;little bit of paper in her fingers, &quot;how I could crush her with&#10;this!--and it is for a thing like this that she must break her heart,&#10;forsooth--for a man" />
    <node id="Rebecca set such a high price on her horses primarily because she recognized Jos's desperation to find horses for his family's escape during wartime and saw an opportunity to maximize her financial gain. She also wanted to further humiliate her enemies, the Bareacres family, by keeping them in a horseless carriage while selling her horses to Jos.&#10;&#10;Jos willingly paid the steep cost of the horses because he was eager to purchase them despite their high price. He saw Rebecca's offer as a means of escape for himself and his sister, Amelia, who were in danger due to the approaching enemy. Rebecca's indifference towards Amelia's relationship with George and her readiness to crush Amelia's heart further demonstrate her lack of concern for others' feelings and her desire for personal satisfaction at their expense." />
    <node id="1. Amelia's anxieties were alleviated through caring for a wounded soldier in her room. The young patient, who had been at the same ball where George Osborne gave Amelia a letter, shared details about the battle. He revealed that George's horse was shot under him and how they thought he had been killed until they found him on Pyramus's carcase with a case-bottle. This information helped Amelia learn more about her husband's safety and whereabouts amidst the warfare.&#10;2. Although no letter is directly mentioned in the account, the young patient's narrative about George Osborne provides crucial updates on his condition after the battle. The patient shares that George suffered severe losses, with many officers and men killed or injured. However, George survived and was found alive, which brings some relief to Amelia despite the dangerous circumstances." />
    <node id="Major O'Dowd's request for his wife Peggy (Mrs. O'Dowd) to wake him early and his opinion that the regiment may march the next morning signifies the possibility of an impending battle or warfare. This is because waking up early and being ready suggests preparation for departure, which is common when soldiers expect to move out.&#10;&#10;Peggy's response shows her understanding of the situation by her actions following his request. Instead of sleeping herself, she decides to stay awake and prepare her husband's traveling valise, clothing, and warlike habiliments for the march. She also packs portable refreshments and a flask of brandy, indicating her anticipation of a potentially long journey or battle ahead. By doing this, Peggy demonstrates her concern and affection for her husband while acknowledging the gravity of the situation." />

    <node id="Rebecca seeks comfort from Mr. Sedley because she recognizes his desperation to find horses for his family's escape during wartime, and she sees an opportunity to sell her horses at a high price. She is taking advantage of the situation to maximize her financial gain.&#10;&#10;Jos is prevented from going to the troops despite his desire to do so due to his concern for his own safety and his sense of duty towards his sister, Amelia. He feels responsible for ensuring her safety and comfort in George's absence, but he also wants to escape the approaching enemy. However, he is worried about leaving Amelia unprotected and deserting her." />
    <node id="Based on the given narrative, there is no direct interaction or dialogue between Rebecca and Jos where Rebecca gives Jos a reason for her avoidance of him. Therefore, we cannot provide specific reasons for Rebecca's avoidance of Jos. Additionally, Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos is not addressed in the narrative.&#10;&#10;However, we can infer some possible reasons for Rebecca's behavior based on the context provided:&#10;&#10;1. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to maintain a distance and not reveal her true intentions regarding the high price of the horses. She wants to take advantage of the situation to maximize her financial gain without appearing overly friendly or cooperative.&#10;2. Rebecca might also be preoccupied with her own plans for escape, as well as making anxious preparations by readying horses for a quick getaway with Isidor. Her indifference towards Amelia's relationship with George and her focus on financial security suggest that she may not have the time or interest to engage with Jos beyond their business transaction.&#10;3. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to keep up appearances, as selling horses to Jos at a high price could be seen as a betrayal to her enemies, the Bareacres family. By maintaining some distance from Jos, she can avoid any potential backlash or consequences from this transaction.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos, there is no information provided in the narrative. It is possible that Rebecca does not consult with her husband about selling the horses to Jos or that her husband is unaware of the transaction. Alternatively, her husband might support her decision to sell the horses at a high price for financial gain or have his own reasons for being indifferent towards Jos. Without further information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos." />
    <node id="The captain, named Captain Dobbin, feels guilty when he sees the grieving figure of Amelia Sedley, who is wearing a crimson sash, because he had come to observe her reaction as the regiment was about to leave for the war, and he is struck by her despair.

She put upon her horses a prodigious price, stating that she would sell both or neither, following her husband's order not to part with them for a price less than what she specified. Rebecca agreed to sell the horses to Jos at Lord Bareacres's agreed-upon price, but she had no genuine affection for the Sedley family and only pretended to be affectionate towards them to further humiliate her enemies, the Bareacres family.&#10;&#10;Rebecca determined the price she wanted for her horses based on her assessment of Jos's eagerness to purchase and the scarcity of the article, with the intention of maximizing her financial gain by taking advantage of the situation." />

Additionally, Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos is not addressed in the narrative.&#10;&#10;However, we can infer some possible reasons for Rebecca's behavior based on the context provided:&#10;&#10;1. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to maintain a distance and not reveal her true intentions regarding the high price of the horses. She wants to take advantage of the situation to maximize her financial gain without appearing overly friendly or cooperative.&#10;2. Rebecca might also be preoccupied with her own plans for escape, as well as making anxious preparations by readying horses for a quick getaway with Isidor. Her indifference towards Amelia's relationship with George and her focus on financial security suggest that she may not have the time or interest to engage with Jos beyond their business transaction.&#10;3. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to keep up appearances, as selling horses to Jos at a high price could be seen as a betrayal to her enemies, the Bareacres family. By maintaining some distance from Jos, she can avoid any potential backlash or consequences from this transaction.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos, there is no information provided in the narrative. It is possible that Rebecca does not consult with her husband about selling the horses to Jos or that her husband is unaware of the transaction. Alternatively, her husband might support her decision to sell the horses at a high price for financial gain or have his own reasons for being indifferent towards Jos.

As they rode away from the house, Mrs. O'Dowd watched them leave and made scornful remarks about Jos's poor horse riding skills, mentioning how he almost drove into the parlor window with his lack of control over the animal.">

Additionally, Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos is not addressed in the narrative.&#10;&#10;However, we can infer some possible reasons for Rebecca's behavior based on the context provided:&#10;&#10;1. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to maintain a distance and not reveal her true intentions regarding the high price of the horses. She wants to take advantage of the situation to maximize her financial gain without appearing overly friendly or cooperative.&#10;2. Rebecca might also be preoccupied with her own plans for escape, as well as making anxious preparations by readying horses for a quick getaway with Isidor. Her indifference towards Amelia's relationship with George and her focus on financial security suggest that she may not have the time or interest to engage with Jos beyond their business transaction.&#10;3. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to keep up appearances, as selling horses to Jos at a high price could be seen as a betrayal to her enemies, the Bareacres family. By maintaining some distance from Jos, she can avoid any potential backlash or consequences from this transaction.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos, there is no information provided in the narrative. It is possible that Rebecca does not consult with her husband about selling the horses to Jos or that her husband is unaware of the transaction. Alternatively, her husband might support her decision to sell the horses at a high price for financial gain or have his own reasons for being indifferent towards Jos.

It also symbolizes a shift in her priorities, as she is no longer concerned with appearances but rather focusing on functionality.&#10;&#10;2. Discovery of a Note: While changing clothes, the woman discovers a note left behind by her companion. The contents of the note are not specified, but it seems to contain important information or instructions that affect their future plans.

Brief Mourning: The woman takes a moment to mourn the absence of her companion, indicating a deep emotional attachment between them. This could be due to feelings of love, friendship, or even a sense of shared purpose. Her brief mourning serves as a reminder of the human connections that often underlie larger plans and ambitions.&#10;&#10;4. Financial Plans: Despite the challenges posed by her companion's departure and the potential dangers ahead, the woman remains committed to their financial plans. She reviews their assets, including jewels, cash, and other valuables, in order to assess their current situation and make informed decisions about how best to proceed. This demonstrates her resilience, determination, and resourcefulness in the face of adversity.&#10;&#10;Overall, the woman's actions and reflections after her companion's departure showcase her ability to adapt to changing circumstances, maintain emotional stability, and remain focused on their shared goals.

Regarding her loyalty to the Sedley family, Rebecca had no genuine affection for them, despite selling the horses to Jos at Lord Bareacres's agreed-upon price. She only pretended to be affectionate towards the Sedleys to further humiliate her enemies, the Bareacres family, who were also in dire need of horses but were kept horseless while Rebecca sold hers to Jos.">

The proclamation is distributed widely in Brussels, and the gathered valets, couriers, and lackeys (who are mostly partisans of the Emperor) discuss it among themselves, expressing their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign.

Therefore, we cannot provide specific reasons for Rebecca's avoidance of Jos. Additionally, Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos is not addressed in the narrative.&#10;&#10;However, we can infer some possible reasons for Rebecca's behavior based on the context provided:&#10;&#10;1. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to maintain a distance and not reveal her true intentions regarding the high price of the horses. She wants to take advantage of the situation to maximize her financial gain without appearing overly friendly or cooperative.&#10;2. Rebecca might also be preoccupied with her own plans for escape, as well as making anxious preparations by readying horses for a quick getaway with Isidor. Her indifference towards Amelia's relationship with George and her focus on financial security suggest that she may not have the time or interest to engage with Jos beyond their business transaction.&#10;3. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to keep up appearances, as selling horses to Jos at a high price could be seen as a betrayal to her enemies, the Bareacres family. By maintaining some distance from Jos, she can avoid any potential backlash or consequences from this transaction.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos, there is no information provided in the narrative. It is possible that Rebecca does not consult with her husband about selling the horses to Jos or that her husband is unaware of the transaction. Alternatively, her husband might support her decision to sell the horses at a high price for financial gain or have his own reasons for being indifferent towards Jos. Without further information, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos.">

Her indifference towards Amelia's relationship with George and her focus on financial security suggest that she may not have the time or interest to engage with Jos beyond their business transaction.&#10;3. Rebecca might be avoiding Jos to keep up appearances, as selling horses to Jos at a high price could be seen as a betrayal to her enemies, the Bareacres family. By maintaining some distance from Jos, she can avoid any potential backlash or consequences from this transaction.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca's husband's attitude towards Jos, there is no information provided in the narrative. It is possible that Rebecca does not consult with her husband about selling the horses to Jos or that her husband is unaware of the transaction.

    <node id="1. Venus requested Cupid to assume the appearance and form of Ascanius (Aeneas' son) and go to Dido with presents from Aeneas.&#10;2. Venus wanted Cupid to make Dido fall in love with Aeneas by shedding &quot;gentle poison&quot; in her veins through kisses, so that she would ensure Aeneas' safety and the success of his mission in her kingdom.&#10;3. Venus was anxious about her son's affairs as she feared the double-tongued Tyrians and knew that Carthage belonged to Juno's care. She wanted to prevent any potential threats or harm to Aeneas by making Dido emotionally attached to him.&#10;4. Venus also planned to take Ascanius to her blissful groves, replacing him with Cupid in the guise of Ascanius, to avoid any danger to Ascanius during Aeneas' stay in Carthage." />

    <node id="Juno, in this narrative, is expressed to be frustrated due to her long-standing hatred towards the Trojans, particularly Aeneas, despite being the goddess of marriage and childbirth. This hatred stems from the beginning of the Trojan War when she favored the Greeks and tried to prevent the prophesied fulfillment of the Trojan prince Aeneas becoming the ancestor of a race that would one day rule over her beloved Carthage.&#10;&#10;In Book I, it is mentioned that Juno harbors an intense dislike for Troy and its people (O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; / What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate). This animosity persists after the Trojan War, as she fears the prophecy of a future Roman Empire rising from the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In contrast to helping rebuild Troy or ensuring Aeneas' safety, Juno seeks out Aeolus, the king of the winds, with the intent to wreak havoc on the restless regions of the storms and unleash their power upon the world (When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys / Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, / At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes). This is a clear demonstration of Juno's intent to harm Aeneas rather than assist him.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is Juno's unrelenting hatred towards the Trojans that drives her actions, and not her role as the goddess of marriage and childbirth." />

    <node id="1. Dido insists on keeping her troops on guard instead of aiding the Trojans because she is in a difficult position as the queen of Carthage. Her people have recently experienced a devastating war, and she must prioritize their safety and security.&#10;2. Additionally, Dido is aware of Juno's animosity towards the Trojans, which makes her cautious about getting involved in helping Aeneas and his crew. She fears that any alliance with the Trojans might provoke Juno's wrath and put Carthage at risk.&#10;3. The narrative also mentions that Dido has heard &quot;an ancient rumor fly&quot; about a future conflict between Carthage and the Trojan race, which may further contribute to her reluctance to aid the Trojans.&#10;4. Lastly, Dido is not yet emotionally attached to Aeneas at this point in the story, so she does not have a personal motivation to go against her initial cautious stance." />
    <node id="1. Aeneas is prophesied to become the founder of martial towers and establish the Roman Empire. The narrative states that he will restore his banished gods to divine rites, win the Latian realm, build the destined town (Rome), and have a settled succession in his line from which the Alban fathers and the long glories of majestic Rome will come. Jupiter also mentions that Aeneas' son (Ascanius/Iulus) will wage successful war in Italy, tame fierce nations, and build cities until the sun completes its annual race three times. After this period, Ascanius will begin his reign, wear the crown for thirty rolling years, and then transfer the seat to Alba Longa. This lineage will eventually lead to Romulus, who becomes the founder of martial towers and the city of Rome, as well as the establisher of the Roman Empire. Reconciled Juno will join his reign, and Caesar from the Julian stock will succeed him, with an empire that is bound only by ocean and fame in the skies." />

    <node id="1. Venus, Aeneas' mother, devises a plan to protect Ascanius by replacing him with Cupid in disguise. She wants Cupid to assume the form of Ascanius and go to Dido with presents from Aeneas. Once there, Cupid is supposed to make Dido fall in love with Aeneas through enchanting kisses, causing her to ensure Aeneas' safety and the success of his mission in her kingdom.&#10;2. Simultaneously, Venus plans to take Ascanius to her blissful groves, keeping him safe and away from Juno's reach during Aeneas' stay in Carthage. This plan aims to prevent any potential threats or harm to Ascanius by making Dido emotionally attached to Aeneas through Cupid's disguise." />
    <node id="Achates was able to convince Aeneas to end his delay and emerge from his cloud because the storm had passed, and their ships were safe. The fleet's safety was crucial for Aeneas, as it ensured the continuation of his journey. Moreover, Achates reminded Aeneas that the goddess-born (Ascanius) was found, and Orontes, who initially opposed the storm, had paid the price for their forfeit. These details emphasized the successful resolution of the immediate dangers, allowing Aeneas to feel more secure about leaving his protective cover." />

The individuals and groups mourning near the Trojan walls are the Trojan women, who are weeping, beating their breasts, rending their hair, and offering rich embroidered vests as presents in hopes of reconciling with Pallas (Athena).&#10;&#10;2. Those purchasing the lifeless body of Hector are unspecified Greeks, who are willing to sell the corpse for sums of gold.&#10;&#10;3. The group fighting near the Trojan walls includes Achilles, who is depicted as drawing the corpse of Hector three times around the city in a brutal display of victory. Priam is also present, attempting to ransom his son's body from the Greeks.&#10;&#10;4. In this scene, the grieved hero (Aeneas) sees several significant figures from the Trojan War:&#10;   - Hector: The eldest son of Priam and a hero of the Trojan War, whose lifeless corpse is being sold for gold.&#10;   - Priam: The unhappy king of Troy, pleading with the Greeks to ransom his son's body.&#10;   - Memnon: The Ethiopian king who fought on the side of the Trojans, recognized by Aeneas among the slain.&#10;   - Penthisilea: The queen of the Amazons, depicted leading her warriors into battle with a pointed dart in their right hands and lunar shields in their left." />

    <node id="1. The speaker is Aeneas, prince of Troy and son of Venus. He has been cast ashore in Carthage after a series of tempests destroyed most of his fleet. This occurred because Juno, who despises the Trojans, sought to obstruct Aeneas's destiny to found a new kingdom in Italy.&#10;2. Aeneas explains that he is a famous warrior, known for his lineage from divine seed and his role in the Trojan War. He mentions key figures such as Priam, Hector, Memnon, Diomede, and Achilles, highlighting Dido's interest in the conflict and its heroes.&#10;3. Aeneas shares that he was expelled from Troy and has faced numerous trials at sea while journeying towards Italy with his remaining fleet. He is an exile, seeking a new home but currently stranded in Carthage due to the whims of Fortune and Fate." />

    <node id="1. As Aeneas entered the city of Carthage, he witnessed a bustling and thriving metropolis, which he compared to a busy beehive. He saw vast buildings, towering walls, and streets filled with people engaging in various activities such as crafting, trading, and feasting. The city was brimming with life, prosperity, and grandeur.&#10;2. The founding of Carthage is not directly addressed when Aeneas enters the city; however, it is mentioned earlier in the narrative that Dido, its queen, founded the city. She was a Tyrian princess who fled from her brother Pygmalion after he murdered her husband Sychaeus. With the assistance of her loyal subjects, she established Carthage and became its first queen." />
    <node id="Juno's consistent opposition to the Trojan state and her role in driving the remnants of the Trojan host away, resulting in a lengthy period of toil and struggle for the Trojans to establish the Roman name, is motivated by her unrelenting hatred towards the Trojans. This hatred dates back to the beginning of the Trojan War when she favored the Greeks and tried to prevent the prophesied fulfillment of Aeneas becoming the ancestor of a race that would one day rule over her beloved Carthage.&#10;&#10;Her animosity persists after the Trojan War due to the prophecy of a future Roman Empire rising from the Trojans, which threatens her cherished city, Carthage. Juno actively seeks to harm Aeneas and his followers instead of assisting them, as seen when she approaches Aeolus, the king of the winds, to wreak havoc on the restless regions of the storms and unleash their power upon the world, putting Aeneas and his fleet at risk.&#10;&#10;In summary, Juno's long-standing hatred towards the Trojans, fueled by her fear of a future Roman Empire that could challenge Carthage's dominance, drives her actions to obstruct Aeneas's destiny and cause suffering for the Trojan remnants." />

He claims to be the one they have been seeking, as he was cast ashore in Carthage after a series of tempests destroyed most of his fleet.&#10;&#10;2. According to his experiences and the perceived generosity of the queen, Aeneas requests to be treated kindly and hospitably. He presents himself as a prince who owes his life to Dido and asks for her help in providing refuge and redress for his shipwrecked crew. Aeneas also mentions that he has heard about Dido's pious nature and her acts of mercy, which further encourages him to seek her assistance. He humbly offers what thanks wretched fugitives can return, emphasizing their status as exiles mourning in misfortune." />

    <node id="1. After the hunting expedition, Aeneas and his crew returned to their ships, where they held a feast to celebrate the successful hunt. They were in high spirits, enjoying their meal and sharing stories from the day's events.&#10;2. As night fell, Aeneas was preoccupied with thoughts of his past and future. He reflected on the recent storm that had destroyed most of his fleet and cast him ashore in Carthage, an event orchestrated by Juno to obstruct his destiny. He also thought about his lineage from divine seed and his role in the Trojan War, recalling key figures such as Priam, Hector, Memnon, Diomede, and Achilles.&#10;3. Aeneas was worried about the safety of his fleet, as it represented the continuation of his journey towards Italy and the establishment of a new kingdom. He was grateful for the successful resolution of the immediate dangers but remained vigilant about potential threats to his mission.&#10;4. Additionally, Aeneas was deeply engaged in conversation with Dido, who had expressed great interest in the Trojan War and its heroes. As they spoke, Venus devised a plan to protect Ascanius by replacing him with Cupid in disguise and making Dido fall in love with Aeneas, ensuring his safety and success in Carthage." />
    <node id="1. Demodocus sings about important and ancient knowledge related to cosmology and astronomy, including the labors of the moon, the origins of men, beasts, and stars, as well as the causes of eclipses, rains, fires, and seasons. This reflects the interest in natural philosophy and early scientific understanding during that time period.&#10;&#10;2. After Demodocus's song, the characters engage in a conversation about the Trojan War, showing their interest in and knowledge of the conflict and its heroes. Dido inquires about key figures such as Priam, Hector, Memnon, Diomede, and Achilles, highlighting her desire to learn more about the war. This topic is significant because it sets the stage for Aeneas's narrative about his experiences and lineage, which will ultimately lead to the foundation of Rome." />
    <node id="1. Repair and safeguard the remaining ships: The storm has damaged several Trojan ships and wrecked three of them. To ensure their survival and continuation of the journey, the Trojans need to repair the damaged vessels and secure those that are still seaworthy.&#10;&#10;2. Mourn the loss of their comrades: The Trojans have lost some of their crew members in the storm. It is essential for them to take time to mourn and honor the dead, which will also help strengthen their bond as a group and boost morale.&#10;&#10;3. Reestablish communication with Dido: Now that the storm has passed and Aeneas has emerged from his protective cover, it's crucial for the Trojans to reconnect with Queen Dido and the Tyrian people. Strengthening this relationship will provide them with a safe harbor and potential alliances in their journey.&#10;&#10;4. Plan their next course of action: With their reduced fleet, the Trojans must reassess their situation and plan their next move. This may involve seeking additional resources, recruiting new crew members, or adjusting their route to Italy.&#10;&#10;5. Continue to exercise caution with Dido: Although she has allowed them to stay temporarily, Dido is still hesitant about forming an alliance with the Trojans due to Juno's animosity and her own people's recent war experiences. The Trojans must tread carefully to avoid provoking any unnecessary conflict or hostility with the Tyrians." />
    <node id="1. Jupiter's message to Cyllenius is a prophecy of peace and reunification. By allowing the Trojans to enter the ports and become guests, it sets the stage for the return of banished Faith, symbolized by Vestal fires burning in hallowed temples. This signals an end to the impious war and the beginning of a peaceful age where fraud and force are restrained.&#10; &#10;2. The inclusion of Trojans among the Tyrians will lead to a more enlightened society, as they learn from one another about various labors, astronomical phenomena, and the origins of different species.&#10;&#10;3. Ultimately, this message highlights that Aeneas and his followers will be able to resume their destined course towards Italy, paving the way for the establishment of the Roman Empire under reconciled Juno's reign and Caesar's succession." />

    <node id="In the provided text, when the god Neptune (also known as the Roman god of the sea) appears, he calmers the rough behavior of the sea with his sovereign trident. The sea, in response to his presence and command, becomes smooth, and the tumultuous waves subside.

By filling it with wine and offerings, Dido acknowledges their noble status and expresses gratitude for their survival.

The journey was filled with hardships and trials as they were constantly beset by adverse weather, shortage of supplies, and hostile encounters with other civilizations.

This goes against Juno's wishes and she has been trying to prevent it. In her lamentation, she compares her own actions to those of Pallas (also known as Athena), who was able to punish one offending Greek by destroying the Greek navy and drowning the men. Juno, on the other hand, feels that she is not able to use her powers to stop the Trojans' success, despite her desire to do so. She attributes this to the will of Fate and Jove (also known as Zeus), and expresses her resentment at being unable to change the course of events. The passage also reveals Juno's motivation for her hostility towards the Trojans, including long-standing grudges and a desire for power and revenge." />

This animosity persists after the Trojan War, as she fears the prophecy of a future Roman Empire rising from the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In contrast to helping rebuild Troy or ensuring Aeneas' safety, Juno seeks out Aeolus, the king of the winds, with the intent to wreak havoc on the restless regions of the storms and unleash their power upon the world (When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys / Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, / At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes). This is a clear demonstration of Juno's intent to harm Aeneas rather than assist him.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is Juno's unrelenting hatred towards the Trojans that drives her actions, and not her role as the goddess of marriage and childbirth.">

This animosity persists after the Trojan War, as she fears the prophecy of a future Roman Empire rising from the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In contrast to helping rebuild Troy or ensuring Aeneas' safety, Juno seeks out Aeolus, the king of the winds, with the intent to wreak havoc on the restless regions of the storms and unleash their power upon the world (When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys / Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, / At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes). This is a clear demonstration of Juno's intent to harm Aeneas rather than assist him.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is Juno's unrelenting hatred towards the Trojans that drives her actions, and not her role as the goddess of marriage and childbirth.">

She attributes this to the will of Fate and Jove (also known as Zeus), and expresses her resentment at being unable to change the course of events. The passage also reveals Juno's motivation for her hostility towards the Trojans, including long-standing grudges and a desire for power and revenge.">

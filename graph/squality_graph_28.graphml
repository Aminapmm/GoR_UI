    <node id=" &#10; A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air escaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall ahead of him crumbled.&#10; &#10; He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the mildly stunning neuro-clubs.&#10; &#10; Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit. Another second , his brain screamed. Just another second—&#10; &#10; &#10; Or would the exits be guarded?&#10; &#10; He heard the hiss.&#10; &#10; It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a slight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be growing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny needle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing mortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of his body.&#10; &#10; He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He'd have fifteen—maybe twenty—seconds before complete lethargy of mind and body overpowered him.&#10;" />

You may die.&quot;&#10; &#10; His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection, massage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain within half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to heart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective weapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender at once.&#10; &#10; &quot;Anti ... anti ...&quot; The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced from his throat. &quot;No ...

Return to consciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black nothingness to a dream-like state of awareness.&#10; &#10; He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders, hands that massaged, manipulated, fought to restore circulation and sensitivity.

He realized that someone had seized it.&#10; &#10; A soft feminine voice spoke to him. &quot;You're wounded?

Not that way. Here, this way.&quot;&#10; &#10; Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight flicked on.&#10; &#10; Hands were guiding him.

    <node id="&#10; &#10; Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side.&#10; &#10; &quot;You are better?&quot; the kind voice asked.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twenty-five and thirty. Her features, devoid of makeup, had an unhealthy-looking pallor, as if she hadn't used a sunlamp for many weeks. Yet, at the same time, her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength. Her straight brown hair was combed backward, tight upon her scalp, and drawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck.&#10; &#10; &quot;I—I am better,&quot; he murmured. His words were still slow and thick. &quot;I am going to live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You will live.&quot;&#10; &#10; He thought for a moment. &quot;How long have I been here?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nine days.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You took care of me?&quot; He noted the deep, dark circles beneath her sleep-robbed eyes.&#10; &#10; She nodded.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're the one who carried me when I was shot?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; Suddenly he began to cough" />
    <node id=" He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spaceman's oxygen mask was clamped over his nose. He felt the heat of electric blankets swathed about his body. Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and he would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach.&#10; &#10; Always, it seemed, the face was above him, floating in the obscuring mist. Always, it seemed, the soft voice was echoing in his ears:&#10; &#10; &quot;Swallow this now. That's it. You must have food.&quot; Or, &quot;Close your eyes. Don't strain. It won't be long. You're getting better.&quot;&#10;  Better , he'd think. Getting better....&#10; &#10; &#10; At last, after one of the periods of lethargy, his eyes opened. The mist brightened, then dissolved.&#10; &#10; He beheld the cracked, unpainted ceiling of a small room, its colorless walls broken with a single, round window. He saw the footboard of his aluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket.&#10; &#10; Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side.&#10; &#10; &quot;You are better?&quot; the kind voice asked.&#10; &#10;" />

As he turned over on his side, his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.&#10; &#10; He sat straight up, his chest heaving.&#10; &#10; The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a merchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly trimmed red beard !&#10; &#10; Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into restless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his brain.&#10; &#10; The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes accused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.&#10; &#10; And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached down and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and knees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a chilling wail in his ears.&#10; &#10; His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man.

Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate. He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb plopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Spacemen,&quot; he muttered, &quot;are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you see's spacemen.&quot;&#10; &#10; He was a neatly dressed civilian.&#10; &#10; Ben smiled. &quot;If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The name's Cobb.&quot; The man hiccoughed. &quot;Spacemen in their white monkey suits.

What the hell good is it, jumpin' from planet to planet?&quot;&#10;  The guy's drunk , Ben thought. He took his drink and moved three stools down the bar.&#10; &#10; Cobb followed. &quot;You don't like the truth, eh, kid? You don't like people to call you a sucker.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ben rose and started to leave the bar, but Cobb grabbed his arm and held him there.&#10; &#10; &quot;Thas what you are—a sucker. You're young now. Wait ten years. You'll be dyin' of radiation rot or a meteor'll get you. Wait and see, sucker!&quot;&#10; &#10; Until this instant, Ben had suppressed his anger.

He saw that he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the city.&#10; &#10; He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette.

    <node id="The woman, named Jake, values the man's ability to walk again above all else, as she believes it is the key for him to continue being a part of the Space Corps. This is evident through her dedicated efforts in caring for him and helping him recover from his neuro-pistol wound.&#10;&#10;The source of hope for both Jake and the man lies in his past achievement of becoming a Space Corps officer. For Jake, the man's status as an officer represents their shared dream of staying in space and working with rockets, despite his current situation as a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape. The trite words associated with being a Space Officer—honesty, loyalty, duty—symbolize the values that have allowed humanity to break free from the limitations of Earth and explore the stars.&#10;&#10;For the man, his past achievement serves as both a source of hope and guilt. He reminisces about the Space Corps' principles and the sacrifices made by those in the organization, such as Everson's successful Moon landing after three failures and a hundred men dead. This reminder of what he once stood for fuels his desire to rejoin the Space Corps and continue working with rockets, which is why walking again becomes his primary focus. However, the man also grapples with guilt from his past actions and the constant haunting memory of the person whose face he can't forget.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jake's main concern is helping the man walk again so that they can both continue pursuing their shared dream of working in space. The man finds hope in rejoining the Space Corps and leaving his past failures and guilt behind, allowing him to focus on a future filled with rockets and space exploration." />

He hadn't realized that the memory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him as constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.&#10; &#10; But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead voice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways obscure the dead face?&#10; &#10; So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant, and hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.&#10; &#10; &quot;You look for someone, senor ?&quot;&#10; &#10; He jumped. &quot;Oh.

    <node id="1. Lax discipline and investigation on the tramp freighter: The skipper of the freighter was on his last flight before retirement, and the crew's discipline was lax. Additionally, investigation of new personnel was even more relaxed, which allowed Ben to successfully stow away on the ship.&#10;&#10;2. Help from friends: Although not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that Ben and Jake had friends who helped them escape from Hoover City and provided them with a hiding place, a small desert-taxi, and a pass to leave the city. These friends were likely part of the group of spacemen that Jake was associated with, who operate beyond Mars and have established a base on an asteroid.&#10;&#10;3. Ben's resourcefulness: Ben demonstrated resourcefulness by finding a way to escape Earth and make his way to Venus. He lied about having been in Hoover City before, and he managed to get rid of his uniform and change his name to avoid detection.&#10;&#10;4. Luck: Ben also had some luck on his side, as he was able to find a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last flight before retirement. This allowed him to blend in with the crew more easily and avoid detection." />

He is described as a young Martian street musician who befriends Ben at the Inn in Hoover City on Venus. The narration suggests that the Martian boy has some form of telepathic ability, which allows him to sense Ben's desire to sit in the shadows. This is implied when the boy says, &quot;A tres fine table. Close in the shadows,&quot; and Ben winces, thinking, &quot;How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows?&quot; However, the story does not provide any explicit explanation for the Martian boy's apparent telepathic abilities or how he knows what Ben is thinking. It is possible that the author included this detail as a way to emphasize the alien and mysterious nature of the Inn and its patrons, or as a way to suggest that the Martians have unique psychological powers that are not fully understood by humans." />

Frowning, he sat down—he and the dead man.&#10; &#10; He listened to the lonely rhythms of the four-piece Martian orchestra.&#10; &#10; The Martians were fragile, doll-like creatures with heads too large for their spindly bodies. Their long fingers played upon the strings of their cirillas or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider legs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still seemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and forgotten grandeur.&#10; &#10; For an instant, Ben's mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead man. He thought, What are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in a smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world? Couldn't they have played their music on Mars? Or had they, like me, felt the challenge of new worlds?&#10; &#10; &#10; He sobered. It didn't matter. He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese waiter. He wet his lips but did not drink.

They certainly didn't look like telepaths, as Ben had heard they were, but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine.&#10; &#10; Once he spied a white-uniformed officer of Hoover City's Security Police.

As more and more white-clad figures become brighter and closer, Ben realizes that they are policemen who are likely there to arrest him, as his picture has probably been circulated on Venusian visiscreens with a reward offered for his capture. At the same time, giant Venusians also remain unmoved in the room, staring at Ben. The situation becomes tense when the police charge towards Ben with neuro-clubs raised, and one of them yells at him to stop. Ben tries to make a run for the exit used by the Martian musicians, but is almost hit by a hissing projectile that creates a small hole in the concrete wall ahead of him.

    <node id="1. Circumstances leading to Ben's charges: Ben was charged with second degree murder and escape after striking and killing a man named Arthur Cobb in a barroom fight in Luna City, and then fleeing from the authorities. The incident occurred while Ben was serving as a junior astrogation officer aboard the Odyssey, and he has been on the run ever since.&#10;2. Connection to renegade group of spacemen: Ben is seeking a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars because he hopes to find refuge with them and avoid capture by the authorities. He came to Hoover City in search of this group, but his current situation is uncertain as the story ends before we learn if he is successful in finding them.&#10;&#10;The circumstances leading to Ben's charges include a combination of factors such as lax discipline on the tramp freighter where he stowed away, his own resourcefulness and luck, and a barroom fight that turned fatal. His current situation connects to the renegade group of spacemen because they are his best hope for finding safety and avoiding capture. The story does not provide explicit details about how Ben became associated with this group or what their motivations are, but it is clear that he sees them as a potential source of support and protection." />

However, the Martian boy misunderstands and thinks that Ben wants to buy drugs or visit a brothel. The author includes this detail to emphasize the language barrier and cultural differences between the characters, as well as to highlight the seedy and desperate atmosphere of the spaceport bar." />

    <node id="Ben Curtis, a misfit spaceman who was charged with second degree murder and escape, managed to escape from Hoover City with the help of his friend Jake (who is also a spaceman) and their network of friends.

This allowed him to avoid detection by the authorities as he made his way to the spaceport.&#10;&#10;Once at the spaceport, Ben found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last flight before retirement. The crew's discipline was lax and the investigation of new personnel was even more so, which allowed Ben to successfully stow away on the ship.

    <node id="The &quot;dead man&quot; that Ben is trying to find and escape from is named Cobb, a stout and flabby man of about forty who hated spacemen.

Ben wants to forget a living man like Cobb, but his death has made him an invisible Siamese twin to Ben.&#10;&#10;Ben needs to find the man with the red beard to escape from Cobb because he believes that this giant can help him. The story does not provide explicit details about their connection, but it is possible that the red-bearded man is a powerful figure who can protect Ben from Cobb or help him deal with his past as a junior astrogation officer and his current status as a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that the red-bearded man may have some connection to Jake, the girl who escaped with Ben from the Inn in Hoover City on Venus. The story mentions that Ben sees a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a merchant spaceman's uniform with a neatly trimmed red beard in his room on Venus, and that this image haunts him in his sleep.

Ben orders a whiskey despite not wanting to drink it as a way to cope with the stress and tension of his situation. He is being pursued by the Venusian police, who are closing in on him, and giant Venusians are staring at him ominously.

The fact that Cobb was drunk and seemingly unaware of the significance of Ben's uniform may have also contributed to Ben's frustration.

She had warned him that he might die if he didn't give himself up, but he refused to change his mind.

The woman then guided him, helping him escape by pushing and pulling him in a different direction before closing a door behind them." />
    <node id="1. The text states that after Ben struck Cobb and realized he was dead, &quot;for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror.&quot; This terror is not explicitly explained, but it seems to be related to the reality of having just killed a man and the immediate aftermath of the act. Ben's fear may have been triggered by the shock of what he had done, the potential consequences of his actions, or the sudden silence and emptiness of the barroom once he realized that everyone else had fled the scene.&#10;2. Additionally, Ben's behavior following the fight, including his hasty escape and hiding in a dark corner while smoking a cigarette, suggests that he was experiencing fear, guilt, and disorientation after realizing what he had done. He may have been afraid of being caught and punished for his actions, or he may have felt guilty about taking another person's life, even if it was in self-defense.&#10;3. The text also notes that Ben was a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape at the time of the fight, which suggests that he was already on the run from the law and had likely experienced fear and stress related to his legal situation. Therefore, it is possible that these existing fears and anxieties contributed to his terror after striking Cobb and prompted him to flee the scene.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ben's terror after hitting Cobb seems to be a complex emotional response triggered by a combination of factors, including shock, guilt, fear of punishment, and anxiety related to his existing legal situation as a fugitive." />

They have already established a new base on an asteroid, beyond the reach of Earth's laws and society.&#10;2.

They have formed their own community and have established a base on an asteroid where they can operate freely.&#10;4.

    <node id="&#10; &quot;Don't the authorities object?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here to search the whole System for a few two-bit crooks.

If we want to risk our lives mining it, that's our business.&quot;&#10; &#10; She pursed her lips. &quot;But if they guessed how strong we are or that we have friends planted in the I. B.

And what will you do when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can't ignore you then.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll be pushed out of the System itself.

    <node id="The lights in the room are turned on by someone or something unspecified in the story. However, Ben Curtis suspects that it might be the Martian kid because of the boy's apparent ability to read his mind and know what he is thinking. Earlier in the story, when Ben wanted to sit in the shadows, the Martian boy had said, &quot;A tres fine table. Close in the shadows&quot; even though Ben had not explicitly expressed this desire. This made Ben wonder how the boy knew what he was thinking, leading him to suspect that the Martian kid might be responsible for turning on the lights in an attempt to reveal him to the police. However, there is no explicit confirmation in the story that the Martian boy is responsible for turning on the lights." />
    <node id="1. The man's determination to walk again stems from his past achievement as a Space Corps officer, which represents his and Jake's shared dream of staying in space and working with rockets. He sees walking again as the key to rejoining the Space Corps and continuing his work with rockets, which is a source of hope for him. His guilt over his past actions and the constant haunting memory of the person he can't forget also fuel his desire to walk again and leave his failures behind.&#10;2. The man's Space Corps background has instilled in him the values of honesty, loyalty, and duty, which he sees as essential for humanity to break free from the limitations of Earth and explore the stars. He remembers a little picture book his mother gave him with captions like &quot;A Space Officer Is Honest&quot; and &quot;A Space Officer Is Loyal,&quot; which symbolize the principles that have allowed mankind to achieve great feats in space exploration. These trite words hold significant meaning for him, as they represent the values that he once stood for and wants to uphold again." />

They consist of about a thousand individuals with a dozen ships, half of whom are wanted by the Interplanetary Bureau of Investigation (I.B.I.), while the others are physical or psycho rejects who cannot return to Earth even if they wanted to.&#10;2.

They have established a base on an asteroid and are accepted as a necessary part of life in the frontier ports despite their outlaw status.&#10;3. The renegade spacemen are not outlaws in the traditional sense, but rather individuals who cannot return to Earth and have formed their own community in the frontiers. They provide necessary transportation of cargo and supplies to the frontier ports, making it difficult for authorities to ignore them despite objections from some officials." />

This is evident through her dedicated efforts in caring for him and helping him recover from his neuro-pistol wound.&#10;&#10;The source of hope for both Jake and the man lies in his past achievement of becoming a Space Corps officer. For Jake, the man's status as an officer represents their shared dream of staying in space and working with rockets, despite his current situation as a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape. The trite words associated with being a Space Officer—honesty, loyalty, duty—symbolize the values that have allowed humanity to break free from the limitations of Earth and explore the stars.&#10;&#10;For the man, his past achievement serves as both a source of hope and guilt. He reminisces about the Space Corps' principles and the sacrifices made by those in the organization, such as Everson's successful Moon landing after three failures and a hundred men dead. This reminder of what he once stood for fuels his desire to rejoin the Space Corps and continue working with rockets, which is why walking again becomes his primary focus. However, the man also grapples with guilt from his past actions and the constant haunting memory of the person whose face he can't forget.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jake's main concern is helping the man walk again so that they can both continue pursuing their shared dream of working in space. The man finds hope in rejoining the Space Corps and leaving his past failures and guilt behind, allowing him to focus on a future filled with rockets and space exploration.">

Connection to renegade group of spacemen: Ben is seeking a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars because he hopes to find refuge with them and avoid capture by the authorities. He came to Hoover City in search of this group, but his current situation is uncertain as the story ends before we learn if he is successful in finding them.&#10;&#10;The circumstances leading to Ben's charges include a combination of factors such as lax discipline on the tramp freighter where he stowed away, his own resourcefulness and luck, and a barroom fight that turned fatal. His current situation connects to the renegade group of spacemen because they are his best hope for finding safety and avoiding capture. The story does not provide explicit details about how Ben became associated with this group or what their motivations are, but it is clear that he sees them as a potential source of support and protection.">

In a barroom fight in Luna City, you struck and killed a man named Arthur Cobb, a pre-fab salesman. You've been charged with second degree murder and escape. A reward of 5,000 credits has been offered for your capture. You came to Hoover City in the hope of finding a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars. You were looking for them in the Blast Inn.&quot;&#10; &#10; He gaped incredulously, struggling to rise from his pillows. &quot;I—don't get it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There are ways of finding out what we want to know.

She explains to Ben that she has been studying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of Investigation, which likely includes personal details about him. Additionally, she mentions having many friends who help her obtain the information she needs. It is also possible that Maggie possesses advanced technology or hacking skills that allow her to access secure databases and gather information without leaving a trace.

First, Cobb had been persistently following and taunting him, which may have worn down Ben's patience. Additionally, Cobb had questioned Ben's decision to join the space exploration mission and called him a sucker, which may have struck a nerve as Ben had worked hard to achieve his dream of becoming a junior astrogation officer. The fact that Cobb was drunk and seemingly unaware of the significance of Ben's uniform may have also contributed to Ben's frustration. These factors, combined with Ben's own stress and fear from being a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape, likely led to his explosive reaction and physical attack on Cobb.">

The text states that after Ben struck Cobb and realized he was dead, &quot;for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror.&quot; This terror is not explicitly explained, but it seems to be related to the reality of having just killed a man and the immediate aftermath of the act. Ben's fear may have been triggered by the shock of what he had done, the potential consequences of his actions, or the sudden silence and emptiness of the barroom once he realized that everyone else had fled the scene.&#10;2. Additionally, Ben's behavior following the fight, including his hasty escape and hiding in a dark corner while smoking a cigarette, suggests that he was experiencing fear, guilt, and disorientation after realizing what he had done. He may have been afraid of being caught and punished for his actions, or he may have felt guilty about taking another person's life, even if it was in self-defense.&#10;3. The text also notes that Ben was a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape at the time of the fight, which suggests that he was already on the run from the law and had likely experienced fear and stress related to his legal situation. Therefore, it is possible that these existing fears and anxieties contributed to his terror after striking Cobb and prompted him to flee the scene.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ben's terror after hitting Cobb seems to be a complex emotional response triggered by a combination of factors, including shock, guilt, fear of punishment, and anxiety related to his existing legal situation as a fugitive.">

He lied about having been in Hoover City before, and he managed to get rid of his uniform and change his name to avoid detection.&#10;&#10;4. Luck: Ben also had some luck on his side, as he was able to find a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last flight before retirement.

The Martian boy who seemed to know that Ben wanted to sit in the shadows is a minor character who does not have a name in the story. He is described as a young Martian street musician who befriends Ben at the Inn in Hoover City on Venus. The narration suggests that the Martian boy has some form of telepathic ability, which allows him to sense Ben's desire to sit in the shadows. This is implied when the boy says, &quot;A tres fine table. Close in the shadows,&quot; and Ben winces, thinking, &quot;How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows?&quot; However, the story does not provide any explicit explanation for the Martian boy's apparent telepathic abilities or how he knows what Ben is thinking. It is possible that the author included this detail as a way to emphasize the alien and mysterious nature of the Inn and its patrons, or as a way to suggest that the Martians have unique psychological powers that are not fully understood by humans.">

The incident occurred while Ben was serving as a junior astrogation officer aboard the Odyssey, and he has been on the run ever since.&#10;2. Connection to renegade group of spacemen: Ben is seeking a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars because he hopes to find refuge with them and avoid capture by the authorities. He came to Hoover City in search of this group, but his current situation is uncertain as the story ends before we learn if he is successful in finding them.&#10;&#10;The circumstances leading to Ben's charges include a combination of factors such as lax discipline on the tramp freighter where he stowed away, his own resourcefulness and luck, and a barroom fight that turned fatal. His current situation connects to the renegade group of spacemen because they are his best hope for finding safety and avoiding capture. The story does not provide explicit details about how Ben became associated with this group or what their motivations are, but it is clear that he sees them as a potential source of support and protection.">

The incident occurred while Ben was serving as a junior astrogation officer aboard the Odyssey, and he has been on the run ever since.&#10;2. Connection to renegade group of spacemen: Ben is seeking a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars because he hopes to find refuge with them and avoid capture by the authorities. He came to Hoover City in search of this group, but his current situation is uncertain as the story ends before we learn if he is successful in finding them.&#10;&#10;The circumstances leading to Ben's charges include a combination of factors such as lax discipline on the tramp freighter where he stowed away, his own resourcefulness and luck, and a barroom fight that turned fatal. His current situation connects to the renegade group of spacemen because they are his best hope for finding safety and avoiding capture. The story does not provide explicit details about how Ben became associated with this group or what their motivations are, but it is clear that he sees them as a potential source of support and protection.">

However, the man also grapples with guilt from his past actions and the constant haunting memory of the person whose face he can't forget.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jake's main concern is helping the man walk again so that they can both continue pursuing their shared dream of working in space.

First, Cobb had been persistently following and taunting him, which may have worn down Ben's patience. Additionally, Cobb had questioned Ben's decision to join the space exploration mission and called him a sucker, which may have struck a nerve as Ben had worked hard to achieve his dream of becoming a junior astrogation officer. The fact that Cobb was drunk and seemingly unaware of the significance of Ben's uniform may have also contributed to Ben's frustration.

He is described as a young Martian street musician who befriends Ben at the Inn in Hoover City on Venus.

This is implied when the boy says, &quot;A tres fine table.

It is possible that the author included this detail as a way to emphasize the alien and mysterious nature of the Inn and its patrons, or as a way to suggest that the Martians have unique psychological powers that are not fully understood by humans." target="1. The text states that after Ben struck Cobb and realized he was dead, &quot;for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror.&quot; This terror is not explicitly explained, but it seems to be related to the reality of having just killed a man and the immediate aftermath of the act. Ben's fear may have been triggered by the shock of what he had done, the potential consequences of his actions, or the sudden silence and emptiness of the barroom once he realized that everyone else had fled the scene.&#10;2. Additionally, Ben's behavior following the fight, including his hasty escape and hiding in a dark corner while smoking a cigarette, suggests that he was experiencing fear, guilt, and disorientation after realizing what he had done. He may have been afraid of being caught and punished for his actions, or he may have felt guilty about taking another person's life, even if it was in self-defense.&#10;3. The text also notes that Ben was a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape at the time of the fight, which suggests that he was already on the run from the law and had likely experienced fear and stress related to his legal situation. Therefore, it is possible that these existing fears and anxieties contributed to his terror after striking Cobb and prompted him to flee the scene.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ben's terror after hitting Cobb seems to be a complex emotional response triggered by a combination of factors, including shock, guilt, fear of punishment, and anxiety related to his existing legal situation as a fugitive.">

The text states that after Ben struck Cobb and realized he was dead, &quot;for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror.&quot; This terror is not explicitly explained, but it seems to be related to the reality of having just killed a man and the immediate aftermath of the act. Ben's fear may have been triggered by the shock of what he had done, the potential consequences of his actions, or the sudden silence and emptiness of the barroom once he realized that everyone else had fled the scene.&#10;2. Additionally, Ben's behavior following the fight, including his hasty escape and hiding in a dark corner while smoking a cigarette, suggests that he was experiencing fear, guilt, and disorientation after realizing what he had done. He may have been afraid of being caught and punished for his actions, or he may have felt guilty about taking another person's life, even if it was in self-defense.&#10;3. The text also notes that Ben was a fugitive charged with second degree murder and escape at the time of the fight, which suggests that he was already on the run from the law and had likely experienced fear and stress related to his legal situation. Therefore, it is possible that these existing fears and anxieties contributed to his terror after striking Cobb and prompted him to flee the scene.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ben's terror after hitting Cobb seems to be a complex emotional response triggered by a combination of factors, including shock, guilt, fear of punishment, and anxiety related to his existing legal situation as a fugitive.">

He has recently arrived on Venus, specifically in Hoover City, after realizing that the memory of the dead man's face he saw during his last space flight is haunting him and he hopes to escape it by exploring alien worlds. Ben enters the Blast Inn, a seedy bar with a variety of patrons and a dimly lit atmosphere, while being followed by a dead man. He is looking for the red-bearded giant, but is also hiding from the police, as his description has likely been circulated along with a reward for his capture. The situation in the bar becomes tense when policemen charge towards him with neuro-clubs raised and one of them yells at him to stop. Ben tries to make a run for it, but a projectile is fired near him, making the situation even more dangerous and confusing.">

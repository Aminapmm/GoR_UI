    <node id="In the story, Peter Matheny, who is revealed to be from Mars, meets Gus Doran in a church after winning money at an ipper game. Matheny is eager to leave the church and have a drink, and Doran suggests they go to a bar downshaft. Once there, Matheny confesses that he and his fellow Martians are having trouble making money on Earth. He mentions the idea of starting a Martian bucket shop handling Martian securities, but says he doesn't know how to proceed. Doran offers to help Matheny find the man they need to make their venture successful, for a fee. Matheny agrees to pay for expenses and offers a &quot;lagniappe,&quot; or small gift, as well. The two men then continue to drink and get to know each other better, with Matheny explaining more about the Martians' financial situation and Doran expressing interest in helping them." />
    <node id="ippers.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're from Mars, aren't you?&quot; he asked in the friendliest tone Matheny had yet heard.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I—&quot; He stuck out his hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. &quot;Damn! Oh, excuse me, I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.&quot;&#10; &#10; Matheny sighed. &quot;A drink is what I need the very most.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.&quot;&#10; &#10; They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what remained of his winnings.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't want to—I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met a Martian. I am very interested.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There aren't many of us on Earth,&quot; agreed Matheny." />
    <node id=" presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who had heard everything already.&#10; &#10; Doran whistled.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's about all, so far,&quot; confessed Matheny. &quot;Perhaps a con is our only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but—well, I don't know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I think—&quot; Doran removed the helmet and stood up.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes?&quot; Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.&#10; &#10; &quot;I may be able to find the man you want,&quot; said Doran. &quot;I just may. It will take a few days and might get a little expensive.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean.... Mr. Doran—Gus—you could actually—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I know. We deserve a celebration!&quot;" />

Well, I will just take and show you.&quot;&#10; &#10; A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a big-city taste like his.&#10; &#10; &quot;What I really want,&quot; said Matheny, &quot;what I really want—I mean what Mars really needs, get me?—is a confidence man.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game for us and make us some real money.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Con man?

This is a church!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh—I see—excuse me, I, I, I—&quot; Matheny backed out of the crowd, shuddering.

I, I, that is—&quot; Matheny cursed his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler?&#10; &#10; &#10; The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell cloak and curly-toed slippers.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're from Mars, aren't you?&quot; he asked in the friendliest tone Matheny had yet heard.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />

Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.&quot; Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his back. &quot;There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Uh!&quot; exclaimed Doran.&#10; &#10; &quot;And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.&#10;'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available to a select few—' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.&quot;&#10; &#10; He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it would have been too presumptuous.

    <node id="Yes, you have captured the main points of the interaction between Matheny and Doran accurately. Matheny is revealing to Doran that the Martian artifacts being sold to tourists on Mars are not authentic relics from an ancient civilization, but are actually manufactured by the Martians themselves as part of a deception to make money. Matheny is looking for help or advice from Doran on how to make their operation more successful, and Doran agrees to listen to what he has to say. However, it is not explicitly stated whether Doran agrees to help Matheny with his operation, only that he will listen to the proposal." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,&quot; he recited. Then, cheerfully: &quot;And that formula, Pete, happens to be the honest-to-zebra truth.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know.&quot; Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. &quot;I'm sorry to—to—I mean of course I trust you, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work. Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure, I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange—Go ahead, boy, go ahead.&quot; Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, it's simple enough,&quot; said Matheny. &quot;It's only that we already are operating con games.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;On Mars, you mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been manufacturing relics ever since.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Huh? Well, why, but—&quot;" />
    <node id=", like, made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!&quot; He winked and nudged.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh,&quot; said Matheny.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to deserve—&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; Matheny said ritually, &quot;I agree with all the archeologists it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,&quot; said Doran. &quot;I mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I do know,&quot; said Matheny. &quot;But we're poor—a handful" />
    <node id="The story suggests that humans do not send tourists to Mars because of the high cost of travel there, which is due to factors such as gravitation and distance. Additionally, Matheny mentions that Martians are &quot;babes in the desert&quot; when it comes to competing with Earth corporations for business, implying that they may not have the resources or infrastructure to accommodate tourists. Doran also expresses concerns about the comfort and amenities on Mars, which may deter potential tourists. Despite this, there is interest in Martian culture and artifacts among some humans, as evidenced by Doran's girlfriend's reaction to a Martian ring he gave her. However, it seems that these interests have not yet translated into a viable tourist industry between Earth and Mars." />
    <node id=". Besides, I have never met a Martian. I am very interested.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There aren't many of us on Earth,&quot; agreed Matheny. &quot;Just a small embassy staff and an occasional like me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother planet and so on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We can't afford it,&quot; said Matheny. &quot;What with gravitation and distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.&quot; As they entered the shaft, he added wistfully: &quot;You Earth people have that kind of money, at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few tourists to us?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I always wanted to,&quot; said Doran. &quot;I would like to see the what they call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like, made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!&quot; He winked and nudged" />
    <node id="That is not necessary. After all,&quot; said Doran with great tact, &quot;with the situation as you have been describing—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will entertain quite a bit.&quot;&#10; &#10; Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. &quot;You're here on business, then?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business manager for the Martian export trade.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault there are so many rackets—uh, taxes—and middlemen and agencies and et cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama top. &quot;Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast" />
    <node id=" thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices, why do you call yourselves poor?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because we are,&quot; said Matheny. &quot;By the time the shipping costs have been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage, and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate Earth taxes—there's very little profit going back to the distillery on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you not got some other business?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only one has been really successful— I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .&#10; &#10; &quot;Our most prominent novelist was co-opted" />
    <node id=" had come from Earth and the organism readjusts. What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well—recruiting.&quot;&#10; &#10; The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and chuckled patronizingly. &quot;I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on Mars, would they?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, we don't expect immigration,&quot; said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed head that seemed too large for his slender body. &quot;" />
    <node id="1. Lack of amenities and infrastructure on Mars: Doran expresses concerns about the lack of comfort and amenities on Mars, suggesting that potential tourists expect certain level of comfort for the high cost of traveling there. Matheny responds by acknowledging the issue and admitting that the Martians are struggling to make money in the tourist trade due to their poverty and inexperience in competing with Earth corporations.&#10;2. High cost of travel: The high cost of travel to Mars is a major factor discouraging tourists, as it is not yet affordable for many people. Matheny laments the fact that Martians cannot earn dollars on the scale they need to compete with established Earth corporations, who could easily outspend them in advertising and infrastructure development.&#10;3. Lack of business managers: The lack of experienced business managers on Mars is also a concern for Matheny, as he has been sent to hire one for the Martian export trade. He implies that the complex system of taxes, middlemen, agencies, and regulations on Earth make it difficult for Martians to earn money and compete in the marketplace. Doran agrees to help Matheny find a suitable business manager for a fee.&#10;4. Possibility of lagniappe: Matheny offers a &quot;lagniappe,&quot; or small gift, as an additional incentive for Doran's assistance. This further illustrates the financial difficulties faced by Martians in their efforts to establish a viable tourist industry with Earth.&#10;&#10;In summary, Doran expresses concerns about the comfort and amenities on Mars, which may deter potential tourists due to the high cost of travel. Matheny responds by acknowledging these issues and explaining the financial challenges faced by Martians as they try to compete with established Earth corporations in the tourist trade." />
    <node id="1. Artifacts scam: Matheny reveals that the supposedly ancient Martian artifacts being sold to tourists are actually manufactured by the Martians themselves as a way to make money. This indicates that the Martian government may be involved in or aware of this deception.&#10;2. Bucket shop idea: Matheny mentions the idea of starting a &quot;Martian bucket shop&quot; handling Martian securities on Earth, but he doesn't know how to proceed. This suggests that the Martian government is interested in exploring different avenues for generating revenue.&#10;3. High cost of shipping and middlemen: Matheny explains that the high cost of shipping and the many middlemen involved in the process significantly reduce the profit margin for Martian products sold on Earth. This makes it difficult for the Martians to earn a significant income from their exports.&#10;4. Complex taxes and regulations: Matheny laments the complex system of taxes, agencies, and regulations on Earth, which he feels puts the Martians at a disadvantage when trying to make money. He implies that the Martians lack experienced business managers who can navigate this system effectively.&#10;5. Lack of capital from Earth: Despite their efforts, the Martians have found it difficult to attract capital from Earth. Matheny explains that this is because established Earth corporations could easily outspend the Martians in advertising and infrastructure development.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Martian government has made efforts to generate revenue through deception (artifacts scam), a potential bucket shop, and exports of various products. However, they have found it difficult to attract capital from Earth due to high costs, middlemen, and the complex system of taxes and regulations. The lack of experienced business managers further compounds these challenges." />
    <node id="The story does not provide a name for the Martian that Gus Doran claims to have secured for Peri's date. He believes she should break her existing date to meet this Martian because he is apparently an important figure with significant financial resources. Specifically, Doran mentions that the Martian has &quot;a hundred million dollars expense money&quot; and that it will not be audited, implying that he has a lot of spending power and freedom during his time on Earth. Additionally, Doran describes the Martian as a &quot;yokel&quot; and &quot;hayseed&quot; who is naive about Earth customs and culture, suggesting that Peri may be able to take advantage of him in some way. However, the story does not provide any more information about why Doran believes this particular Martian would be a better date for Peri than the person she already has a date with." />

And here is the solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.&quot;&#10; &#10; Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. &quot;He has got a hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates, legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about as much backbone as a piece of steak alga.

    <node id="There are several reasons why humans do not send tourists to Mars despite the interest from some individuals. The high cost of travel to Mars is a major factor, which is due to the significant challenges posed by gravitation and distance. Matheny mentions that it is too expensive for Martians to travel to Earth for pleasure, and the same applies to humans traveling to Mars.&#10;&#10;Another reason is the lack of infrastructure and resources on Mars to accommodate tourists.

Matheny also refers to Martians as &quot;babes in the desert&quot; when it comes to competing with Earth corporations for business, implying that they may not have the resources or infrastructure to support a tourist industry.&#10;&#10;Finally, while there is interest in Martian culture and artifacts among some humans, it seems that this interest has not yet translated into a viable tourist industry between Earth and Mars. The Martians have resorted to manufacturing relics and deceiving tourists to make money, which suggests that the market for authentic Martian artifacts may be limited or non-existent.&#10;&#10;In summary, the high cost of travel, lack of infrastructure and resources on Mars, and uncertain demand for Martian culture and artifacts are the reasons why humans do not send tourists to Mars." />

Well, why, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary haul,&quot; said Matheny. &quot;Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars and they depend on our people to—Well, anyhow—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I will be clopped! Good for you!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Doran blew up in laughter. &quot;That is one thing I would never spill, even without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,&quot; said Matheny apologetically. &quot;She was another official project.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected Earth coins.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, that. Sure, I remember—Hey!

    <node id="The Billingsworth Expedition's discovery fifty years ago was the ruins of an alleged ancient Martian civilization. However, it is revealed in the story that these ruins were actually erected by the Martians themselves as part of a deception. Following this discovery, the Martians have been manufacturing relics and artifacts to sell to tourists, profiting from projects like the &quot;Little Girl,&quot; which was based on a dying girl's collection of Earth coins." />
    <node id="When Doran suggests that he can provide contacts for someone who could &quot;terminate&quot; someone else on Mars, he is implying that he knows people who could potentially carry out illegal or unethical activities. This is related to Matheny's earlier mention of needing a &quot;slipstring,&quot; which he compared to a con man. A slipstring, in this context, refers to a dishonest person who could help the Martians with their financial ventures on Earth. Doran seems to be suggesting that he can also provide contacts for a different kind of dishonest person - one who could carry out illegal activities - which further emphasizes his connections and resourcefulness. However, it's important to note that Doran makes it clear that he himself would not want to be involved in any illegal activity and that he would only provide information without knowing anything about the specifics of the situation." />
    <node id=" his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.&#10; &#10; &quot;You said one thing, Pete,&quot; Doran remarked. &quot;About needing a slipstring.

And maybe I have got a few contacts.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What?&quot; Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.&#10; &#10; Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.&#10;&quot;I am not that man,&quot; he said frankly. &quot;But in my line I get a lot of contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if, say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you a phone number.&quot;&#10; &#10; He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. &quot;Sure, you may not be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday.

He may also be sharing information about the Martians' financial situation or operations on Earth, which they want to keep private in order to maintain their competitive advantage and avoid potential legal or ethical issues. The use of the oath box and conditioner helmet emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and Matheny's intention to protect his business interests and those of his fellow Martians." />
    <node id=", you may not be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have got to think positively.&quot;&#10; &#10; Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe he became overcautious.&#10; &#10; They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.&#10; &#10; &quot;I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;But it would have to be under security.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Okay by me.

But—but—&quot; Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.&#10; &#10; In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.

Matheny's jaw clanked down.&#10; &#10; &quot;Whassa matter?&quot; asked Doran. &quot;Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic technician before?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Uh, yes, but—well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.&quot;&#10; &#10; Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.&#10; &#10; &quot;What'll you have?&quot; asked Doran. &quot;It's on me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, I couldn't let you.

    <node id="Matheny decided to enter a church during his visit to a new planet because he had just won money at an ipper game and felt like he needed to &quot;get the hell out of here&quot; after being overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the unfamiliar environment. Upon arriving at the church, he sticks out his hand to shake and introduces himself to Gus Doran, who suggests they go to a bar downshaft for a drink. Matheny agrees and confesses to Doran that he and his fellow Martians are having trouble making money on Earth. He also mentions the idea of starting a Martian bucket shop handling Martian securities, but says he doesn't know how to proceed. Doran offers to help Matheny find the man they need to make their venture successful for a fee, and Matheny agrees to pay for expenses and offer a &quot;lagniappe,&quot; or small gift, as well. The two men then continue to drink and get to know each other better, with Matheny explaining more about the Martians' financial situation and Doran expressing interest in helping them." />
    <node id="Matheny and Doran are in a situation where they need to ensure confidentiality for the information Matheny is about to share, which has to do with sensitive or confidential business information related to his Martian bucket shop handling Martian securities and potentially other financial operations on Earth. They use security measures such as an oath box and conditioner helmet to protect this information. Matheny may be hesitant to share this information because he wants to avoid potential legal or ethical issues, as well as maintain the competitive advantage of his fellow Martians in their financial ventures. Additionally, revealing this information could potentially put their financial interests at risk if it falls into the wrong hands." />
    <node id="Matheny agrees to go out with Gus despite his initial wariness about prying individuals because Gus has offered to help him find the man they need to make their Martian bucket shop successful, for a fee. Matheny may see this as a valuable opportunity to advance his financial venture and is willing to continue the interaction in order to hear more about Gus's proposal.&#10;&#10;Matheny needs to get a hotel room and new clothes because he has just arrived on Earth and is not familiar with the local customs or living conditions. He may feel out of place in his current state, and getting a hotel room and updating his wardrobe could help him fit in better and feel more comfortable in this unfamiliar environment. Additionally, the drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward may have helped sober him up, making it more important for him to present himself in a professional and respectable manner as he continues his discussions with Gus about their potential business partnership." />
    <node id=" &quot;You are interesting me strangely, my friend. Say on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot; Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an odd quality.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, sorry, Gus,&quot; he said. &quot;I spoke too much.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;By all means.&quot; Matheny disposed of his last beer. &quot;I could use some gaiety.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room first and some more up-to-date clothes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Allez ,&quot; said Matheny. &quot;If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .&quot;&#10; &#10; The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.&#10;  Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will quibble.&#10; " />
    <node id="Matheny agrees to go have fun with Gus despite his initial discomfort and desire to forget their conversation because Gus has offered to help him find the man they need to make their Martian bucket shop successful, for a fee.

    <node id="In the story, when Doran suggests that he can provide contacts for someone who could &quot;terminate&quot; someone else on Mars, he is implying that he knows people who could potentially carry out illegal or unethical activities. He makes it clear that he himself would not want to be involved in any illegal activity and that he would only provide information without knowing anything about the specifics of the situation. Therefore, Doran is suggesting that he can provide contacts for a hitman or an assassin who could carry out a killing on Mars, but he does not explicitly state this and is careful to distance himself from any wrongdoing." />
    <node id="1. Doran is asking Peri to accompany the Martian because he believes that she can take advantage of the Martian's naiveté and significant financial resources during his time on Earth. Doran describes the Martian as a &quot;yokel&quot; and &quot;hayseed&quot; who is unfamiliar with Earth customs and culture, implying that Peri may be able to use this to her advantage. He also mentions that the Martian has &quot;a hundred million dollars expense money&quot; which will not be audited, suggesting that the Martian has a lot of spending power and freedom during his time on Earth.&#10;2. Doran's past experience plays into this situation because he has experience dealing with people who have significant financial resources and are unfamiliar with Earth customs and culture. He mentions that he has a small nephew whom he has had similar experiences with, implying that he is confident in his ability to navigate such situations. Doran's familiarity with the Martian's situation also allows him to present the opportunity to Peri in a way that emphasizes the potential benefits for her, such as the chance to take advantage of the Martian's spending power and naiveté." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, it seems that Peri's plan for handling the situation with Mr. Sastro is to cancel or reschedule their date because she has received a more lucrative offer from Gus Doran. Doran claims to have secured a Martian as a potential date for her, and he emphasizes the Martian's significant financial resources and naiveté about Earth customs. Peri seems to be considering this opportunity seriously, as evidenced by her narrowed gaze and icy response to Doran's revelation.&#10;2. The fact that Peri has an awful headache and cannot see Mr. Sastro tonight could have several potential significance in this context:&#10;* It could simply be a coincidence, and Peri may have genuinely come down with a headache at the same time she received Doran's offer.&#10;* It could also be a convenient excuse for Peri to cancel or reschedule her date with Mr. Sastro without causing offense or raising suspicion.&#10;* Alternatively, Peri's headache could be a sign of stress or anxiety related to the decision she is facing. She may be feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to choose between two potentially advantageous opportunities and is using the headache as an opportunity to delay making a decision.&#10;&#10;Without further context, it is difficult to say for certain what Peri's headache means in this situation. However, it is clear that it has caused her to reconsider or postpone her plans with Mr. Sastro and may be influencing her decision-making process." />
    <node id=" if I did not happen to have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be like taking candy from a baby.&quot;&#10; &#10; Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and cream left overnight on Pluto. &quot;Badger?&quot; she asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a million is three hundred thirty-three—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Is five hundred thousand flat,&quot; said Peri. &quot;Too bad I just got an awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight.

She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise—or had it been the chairman of the board?—back several thousand dollars. Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely on top and tight around the hips.&#10; &#10; After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.&#10; &#10; She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. &quot;" />
    <node id="1. Matheny is surprised upon entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp; Grill because he sees a 3-D image of an ecdysiastic technician (a stripper or burlesque performer) under ten magnifications, which he finds shocking and unexpected.&#10;2. Matheny hesitates when Doran offers to buy him a drink because he is polite and may not want to impose on Doran's generosity, as he has already agreed to help him find the man they need to make their Martian financial venture successful for a fee." />
    <node id="1. High cost of travel: Matheny acknowledges that the high cost of traveling to Mars is a major challenge in promoting the tourist trade. The significant challenges posed by gravitation and distance make it too expensive for many people to afford, and Martians are also struggling to earn dollars on a scale that can compete with established Earth corporations.&#10;2. Lack of amenities and infrastructure: Doran expresses concerns about the comfort and amenities on Mars, which may deter potential tourists who expect a certain level of comfort for the high cost of traveling there. Matheny admits that this is a valid concern, as Martians are struggling to make money in the tourist trade due to their poverty and inexperience in competing with Earth corporations.&#10;3. Artifacts scam: To address the financial challenges they face, Matheny reveals that the supposedly ancient Martian artifacts being sold to tourists are actually manufactured by the Martians themselves as part of a deception to make money. This is justified by the high cost of travel and lack of infrastructure on Mars, which makes it difficult for the Martians to establish a viable tourist industry. However, this approach raises ethical concerns related to archaeological preservation and authenticity. Matheny may argue that the artifacts scam is necessary to generate revenue until more sustainable and ethical forms of tourism can be developed." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, there is no explicit information about what it would take for Gus Doran to consider Matheny's job offer on Mars. While Doran does express interest in helping Matheny with his financial ventures and offers to listen to his proposal, he does not make any commitments about moving to Mars or taking a formal job role.&#10;&#10;However, it is possible to infer some potential factors that might influence Doran's decision based on the information provided. For example, Doran seems interested in the possibility of earning additional income through Matheny's proposed lagniappe and expenses payments. He also expresses admiration for Matheny and his fellow Martians, suggesting that he may be attracted to the idea of working with them more closely.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Doran is currently employed as a high-powered sales scientist in New York and has retirement benefits associated with that role. This means that he would need to weigh the potential benefits of Matheny's offer against the risks of leaving his current job and losing those benefits. Additionally, while Doran expresses interest in helping Matheny, it is not clear whether this would involve a formal employment arrangement or simply an informal consulting role.&#10;&#10;Overall, more information would be needed to determine what it would take for Gus Doran to consider Matheny's job offer on Mars. However, based on the story provided, potential factors could include the potential financial benefits of the offer, the opportunity to work with Matheny and his fellow Martians, and the risks associated with leaving his current job in New York." />
    <node id="1. In this new environment, Matheny is being propositioned for a night out with Gus, who offers to help him find the man they need to make their Martian financial venture successful for a fee.&#10;2. The suggestion regarding a certain blonde woman's interest in Matheny is not explicitly stated in the story. However, it is mentioned that there are several women present in the bar, including one who is described as a &quot;three-D image of an ecdysiastic technician under ten magnifications.&quot; It is possible that Gus may be implying that Matheny could potentially meet and interact with these women during their night out." />
    <node id="The protagonist, Peter Matheny, encountered a crap game while standing at a table in a bar on Mars. At first, he had difficulty adjusting to the rhythm of throwing the dice due to Earth's gravity. However, after getting the hang of it, he managed to throw a row of sevens, which was a customary form of challenge on Mars. The other players responded by pushing chips toward him, and when Matheny missed a throw, they treated it as simple courtesy, allowing him to try again.&#10;&#10;The confusion regarding the rules and use of cocked dice stemmed from the fact that Matheny was unfamiliar with the local rules of the game on Mars. When he inquired about the cocked dice, the other players informed him that he had been playing correctly and that he had done well for his first time. This suggests that cocked dice may not have been used or were used differently in this version of craps compared to what Matheny was familiar with on Earth." />
    <node id="o? No, he didn't want to bother learning something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.&#10; &#10; He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off. But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.&#10; &#10; &quot;I say!&quot; he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the green table. &quot;I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You did all right, brother,&quot; said a middle-aged lady with an obviously surgical bodice.&#10; &#10; &quot;But—I mean—when do we start actually playing ?

    <node id="Based on the story provided, it is mentioned that a high-powered sales scientist in Newer York (presumably a futuristic version of New York) would earn more than what Matheny is offering. Specifically, Doran mentions that retirement benefits would be lost if they quit their current job, suggesting that they have a stable and well-paying position there.&#10;&#10;However, the story does not provide an exact figure for how much more a high-powered sales scientist on Earth would charge for their services. Therefore, it is difficult to give a precise answer to this question without further information." />

    <node id="The story suggests that the &quot;sophisticated man,&quot; Peter Matheny, is a Martian who is out of place in the chaotic and overwhelming atmosphere of the Earth church event. He is revealed to be more comfortable in environments where he can understand the rules and systems at play, such as the ipper game or even a rigged roulette wheel. The Earth, with its complex organizations and masses of people, seems to be difficult for him to navigate.&#10;&#10;Matheny's reaction to the church event highlights his discomfort in this unfamiliar setting. He mistakes the church for a gambling establishment and is confused when he is corrected by the woman at the entrance. When he realizes his mistake, he becomes embarrassed and tries to leave as soon as possible. The Earthman who helps him recover his chips then strikes up a conversation with Matheny and offers to take him to a bar downshaft, where they can have a drink together.&#10;&#10;This interaction suggests that despite being from Mars, Matheny shares some common ground with the sophisticated man of Earth - he is interested in having a drink and getting to know this new acquaintance better. However, his reaction to the church event also highlights the differences between the two cultures and their expectations for social gatherings.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story suggests that the sophisticated man's identity is shaped by his experiences and cultural background, but that there are also commonalities across different cultures that allow people to connect with each other despite their differences. Matheny's reaction to the church event highlights both the challenges of navigating unfamiliar social environments and the potential for connection and understanding across cultural boundaries." />

A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any individual sign through all that flimmering neon.

    <node id="The Martian authors and stamp issuers have made efforts to generate income through successful novels like &quot;I Was a Slave Girl on Mars&quot; and selling postage stamps. However, they have faced several obstacles in attracting capital from Earth. One major challenge is the complex system of taxes, agencies, and regulations on Earth, which puts the Martians at a disadvantage when trying to make money. They lack experienced business managers who can navigate this system effectively.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Matheny mentions that it is too expensive for Martians to travel to Earth for pleasure, and the same applies to humans traveling to Mars due to significant challenges posed by gravitation and distance. The lack of infrastructure and resources on Mars also makes it difficult to accommodate tourists and provide them with the necessary amenities.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the market for authentic Martian artifacts may be limited or non-existent, which is why the Martians have resorted to manufacturing relics and deceiving tourists to make money. The high cost of shipping and many middlemen involved in the process significantly reduce the profit margin for Martian products sold on Earth, making it difficult for them to earn a significant income from their exports.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, the Martians are still interested in exploring different avenues for generating revenue. Matheny mentions the idea of starting a &quot;Martian bucket shop&quot; handling Martian securities on Earth, but he doesn't know how to proceed. Doran agrees to help Matheny find the man they need to make their venture successful for a fee, indicating that attracting capital from Earth remains an ongoing challenge for the Martians." />

We do make a high percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around—you know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars—but expressed absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How about postage stamps?&quot; inquired Doran. &quot;Philately is a big business, I have heard.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It was our mainstay,&quot; admitted Matheny, &quot;but it's been overworked. Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Doran whistled. &quot;I got to give your people credit for enterprise, anyway!&quot; He fingered his mustache. &quot;Uh, pardon me, but have you tried to, well, attract capital from Earth?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; said Mat" />

Gus has offered to help him find the man they need to make their Martian bucket shop successful, for a fee. Additionally, Matheny has recently arrived on Earth and is not familiar with the local customs or living conditions, which makes him feel out of place. Getting a hotel room and updating his wardrobe could help him fit in better and feel more comfortable in this unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, the drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward may have helped sober him up, making it more important for him to present himself in a professional and respectable manner as he continues his discussions with Gus about their potential business partnership." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it is suggested that Matheny finds comfort in trying to understand and beat systems, such as the operation of a roulette wheel. Therefore, it is likely that the intellectual challenge of figuring out the management's system for operating a roulette wheel would have provided soothing entertainment for him. Additionally, the presence of other people at the roulette wheel would have given Matheny a sense of familiarity, as he would have been among people he understands. The Church of Choice, with its relatively austere sign, offers a break from the overwhelming neon lights and provides the rest that Matheny is seeking. It is possible that the church also represents a sense of familiarity to him, as it is a type of organization that exists on Earth and may be similar to religious or philosophical organizations on Mars." />
    <node id="No, the Billingsworth Expedition did not find any authentic relics from Earth on Mars. The ruins and relics that they discovered were actually erected and manufactured by the Martians themselves as part of a deception to make money from tourists.

    <node id="The purpose of Mr. Matheny's visit to Earth is to recruit for their operation on Mars. When he mentions recruiting, he means finding people who are willing to help with their business venture rather than immigrate to Mars. They are not expecting immigration because, as they have discovered, the Martian ruins and relics being sold to tourists are not authentic but manufactured by the Martians themselves as part of a deception. Therefore, they do not need more people on Mars, but rather individuals who can assist with their operation on Earth. This is why Matheny seeks help from Doran, to make their operation more successful." />

Lack of amenities and infrastructure on Mars: Doran expresses concerns about the lack of comfort and amenities on Mars, suggesting that potential tourists expect certain level of comfort for the high cost of traveling there. Matheny responds by acknowledging the issue and admitting that the Martians are struggling to make money in the tourist trade due to their poverty and inexperience in competing with Earth corporations.&#10;2.

While Doran does express interest in helping Matheny with his financial ventures and offers to listen to his proposal, he does not make any commitments about moving to Mars or taking a formal job role.&#10;&#10;However, it is possible to infer some potential factors that might influence Doran's decision based on the information provided. For example, Doran seems interested in the possibility of earning additional income through Matheny's proposed lagniappe and expenses payments. He also expresses admiration for Matheny and his fellow Martians, suggesting that he may be attracted to the idea of working with them more closely.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Doran is currently employed as a high-powered sales scientist in New York and has retirement benefits associated with that role. This means that he would need to weigh the potential benefits of Matheny's offer against the risks of leaving his current job and losing those benefits. Additionally, while Doran expresses interest in helping Matheny, it is not clear whether this would involve a formal employment arrangement or simply an informal consulting role.&#10;&#10;Overall, more information would be needed to determine what it would take for Gus Doran to consider Matheny's job offer on Mars. However, based on the story provided, potential factors could include the potential financial benefits of the offer, the opportunity to work with Matheny and his fellow Martians, and the risks associated with leaving his current job in New York.">

The other players responded by pushing chips toward him, and when Matheny missed a throw, they treated it as simple courtesy, allowing him to try again.&#10;&#10;The confusion regarding the rules and use of cocked dice stemmed from the fact that Matheny was unfamiliar with the local rules of the game on Mars.

However, they have faced several obstacles in attracting capital from Earth. One major challenge is the complex system of taxes, agencies, and regulations on Earth, which puts the Martians at a disadvantage when trying to make money. They lack experienced business managers who can navigate this system effectively.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Matheny mentions that it is too expensive for Martians to travel to Earth for pleasure, and the same applies to humans traveling to Mars due to significant challenges posed by gravitation and distance. The lack of infrastructure and resources on Mars also makes it difficult to accommodate tourists and provide them with the necessary amenities.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the market for authentic Martian artifacts may be limited or non-existent, which is why the Martians have resorted to manufacturing relics and deceiving tourists to make money. The high cost of shipping and many middlemen involved in the process significantly reduce the profit margin for Martian products sold on Earth, making it difficult for them to earn a significant income from their exports.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, the Martians are still interested in exploring different avenues for generating revenue.

High cost of travel: The high cost of travel to Mars is a major factor discouraging tourists, as it is not yet affordable for many people. Matheny laments the fact that Martians cannot earn dollars on the scale they need to compete with established Earth corporations, who could easily outspend them in advertising and infrastructure development.&#10;3. Lack of business managers: The lack of experienced business managers on Mars is also a concern for Matheny, as he has been sent to hire one for the Martian export trade. He implies that the complex system of taxes, middlemen, agencies, and regulations on Earth make it difficult for Martians to earn money and compete in the marketplace. Doran agrees to help Matheny find a suitable business manager for a fee.&#10;4.

High cost of travel: The high cost of travel to Mars is a major factor discouraging tourists, as it is not yet affordable for many people. Matheny laments the fact that Martians cannot earn dollars on the scale they need to compete with established Earth corporations, who could easily outspend them in advertising and infrastructure development.&#10;3. Lack of business managers: The lack of experienced business managers on Mars is also a concern for Matheny, as he has been sent to hire one for the Martian export trade. He implies that the complex system of taxes, middlemen, agencies, and regulations on Earth make it difficult for Martians to earn money and compete in the marketplace. Doran agrees to help Matheny find a suitable business manager for a fee.&#10;4. Possibility of lagniappe: Matheny offers a &quot;lagniappe,&quot; or small gift, as an additional incentive for Doran's assistance.

The other players responded by pushing chips toward him, and when Matheny missed a throw, they treated it as simple courtesy, allowing him to try again.&#10;&#10;The confusion regarding the rules and use of cocked dice stemmed from the fact that Matheny was unfamiliar with the local rules of the game on Mars.

Lack of amenities and infrastructure: Doran expresses concerns about the comfort and amenities on Mars, which may deter potential tourists who expect a certain level of comfort for the high cost of traveling there. Matheny admits that this is a valid concern, as Martians are struggling to make money in the tourist trade due to their poverty and inexperience in competing with Earth corporations.&#10;3. Artifacts scam: To address the financial challenges they face, Matheny reveals that the supposedly ancient Martian artifacts being sold to tourists are actually manufactured by the Martians themselves as part of a deception to make money. This is justified by the high cost of travel and lack of infrastructure on Mars, which makes it difficult for the Martians to establish a viable tourist industry. However, this approach raises ethical concerns related to archaeological preservation and authenticity.

    <edge source="The story suggests that the &quot;sophisticated man,&quot; Peter Matheny, is a Martian who is out of place in the chaotic and overwhelming atmosphere of the Earth church event. He is revealed to be more comfortable in environments where he can understand the rules and systems at play, such as the ipper game or even a rigged roulette wheel. The Earth, with its complex organizations and masses of people, seems to be difficult for him to navigate.&#10;&#10;Matheny's reaction to the church event highlights his discomfort in this unfamiliar setting. He mistakes the church for a gambling establishment and is confused when he is corrected by the woman at the entrance. When he realizes his mistake, he becomes embarrassed and tries to leave as soon as possible. The Earthman who helps him recover his chips then strikes up a conversation with Matheny and offers to take him to a bar downshaft, where they can have a drink together.&#10;&#10;This interaction suggests that despite being from Mars, Matheny shares some common ground with the sophisticated man of Earth - he is interested in having a drink and getting to know this new acquaintance better. However, his reaction to the church event also highlights the differences between the two cultures and their expectations for social gatherings.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story suggests that the sophisticated man's identity is shaped by his experiences and cultural background, but that there are also commonalities across different cultures that allow people to connect with each other despite their differences. Matheny's reaction to the church event highlights both the challenges of navigating unfamiliar social environments and the potential for connection and understanding across cultural boundaries." target=" trying to mark the cards.

    <edge source="The Martian authors and stamp issuers have made efforts to generate income through successful novels like &quot;I Was a Slave Girl on Mars&quot; and selling postage stamps. However, they have faced several obstacles in attracting capital from Earth. One major challenge is the complex system of taxes, agencies, and regulations on Earth, which puts the Martians at a disadvantage when trying to make money. They lack experienced business managers who can navigate this system effectively.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Matheny mentions that it is too expensive for Martians to travel to Earth for pleasure, and the same applies to humans traveling to Mars due to significant challenges posed by gravitation and distance. The lack of infrastructure and resources on Mars also makes it difficult to accommodate tourists and provide them with the necessary amenities.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the market for authentic Martian artifacts may be limited or non-existent, which is why the Martians have resorted to manufacturing relics and deceiving tourists to make money. The high cost of shipping and many middlemen involved in the process significantly reduce the profit margin for Martian products sold on Earth, making it difficult for them to earn a significant income from their exports.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, the Martians are still interested in exploring different avenues for generating revenue. Matheny mentions the idea of starting a &quot;Martian bucket shop&quot; handling Martian securities on Earth, but he doesn't know how to proceed.

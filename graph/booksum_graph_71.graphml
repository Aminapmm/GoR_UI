    <node id="1. Honor and Crown: The seer's prophecy reveals that Lavinia will shine with honor and be crowned as a queen, which indicates her future role as a respected figure in the kingdom.&#10;&#10;2. War and Changed State: However, this positive destiny is accompanied by the devastating news of war that will be caused by her &quot;irrevocable fate.&quot; The country will suffer greatly from this conflict, indicating a significant impact on Lavinia's homeland, Latium.&#10;&#10;3. Fiery Portent: The flames surrounding Lavinia during the religious ceremony symbolize her future role and the war that will affect her kingdom. This portent marks the beginning of Lavinia's association with fire and foreshadows her impact on the country.&#10;&#10;4. A Foreign Son: The prophecy also mentions a foreign son arriving in Latium, who is destined to have a significant role in shaping the future of the kingdom. This mysterious prince will cause both war and peace in the region.&#10;&#10;In summary, Lavinia's association with flames reveals her honorable future role as a queen but also indicates that her marriage to this foreign prince will lead to war and ultimately change the state of Latium. The seer's prophecy sets the stage for Lavinia's significant role in the narrative while foreshadowing the challenges her kingdom will face due to her destiny." />

This ritual marks the beginning of a military campaign, signifying that the war is officially declared and the gods are watching over the Roman soldiers as they go into battle. It underscores the religious beliefs and practices that were intertwined with the daily life and major events of the Roman society, including their wars and conquests." />

Weapons and Armor: The passage describes how rural workers, when going to war, undergo a transformation as they set aside their farming tools like hammers, scythes, and shares, replacing them with swords and plumes - symbols of war. They also create or modify weapons such as chariots, helmets, shields, and cuishes (a part of the armor protecting the thighs) using materials like silver and gold.&#10;   &#10;2. Role of Muses: According to the passage, Muses are essential for recording and preserving the historical events related to wars and the actions of great warriors for future generations. The poet invokes Erato, one of the Muses, to help him relate the past and present state of Latium, including the arrival of the Trojans, the battles they fought, and the conclusion of the war by a &quot;godlike man.&quot; By doing so, the poet acknowledges the importance of Muses in preserving and transmitting historical knowledge." />

This supernatural being manipulated Queen Amata's emotions, leading her to promote civil unrest and encourage resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, the Trojan guest.&#10;&#10;As a result of the Fury's influence, battles and conflicts have erupted in Latium.

    <node id="The goddess Juno asked the Fury Alecto to incite war between the Latians and the Trojans and expel the Trojans from Italy because she was determined to prevent the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, the Trojan guest. Juno is deeply opposed to the Trojans, as she holds a grudge against them due to past events involving her favorite, Queen Dido of Carthage, who killed herself after Aeneas abandoned her. By stirring up conflict and hostility between the two groups, Juno aims to protect her own interests and maintain her glory. The Fury Alecto, with her delight in wars and human suffering, is an ideal agent for Juno to use in order to achieve her goals of chaos and destruction in Latium." />

    <node id="Queen Amata's distressing behavior in response to her inability to dissuade her kinsman from seeking a foreign alliance is primarily caused by the manipulation of Alecto, a Fury sent by Juno. Driven by Juno's desire to incite war between the Latians and the Trojans, Alecto fills Queen Amata with disdain for Turnus and the new Trojan guest, leading her to promote civil unrest and encourage resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas. This resistance ultimately results in conflict and chaos in Latium.&#10;&#10;In the given text, we see that King Latinus has announced his decision to accept the alliance proposed by the Trojan hero Aeneas, who seeks Lavinia's hand in marriage. However, Queen Amata is deeply distressed by this development because she had been hoping for her daughter to marry Turnus, a local prince. Unable to change her kinsman's mind, Queen Amata's distress manifests as resistance and conflict, which spreads among the people of Latium and contributes to the impending war between the Latins and the Trojans.&#10;&#10;This manipulation by Alecto, combined with Queen Amata's personal desires and Juno's grudge against the Trojans, results in her distressing behavior. In essence, Queen Amata becomes a pawn in Juno's grand scheme to prevent the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, ultimately leading to chaos and conflict in Latium." />

    <node id="1) Presence of a powerful goddess: The location near Circe's shores is significant because it is the domain of the goddess Circe, who has the power to transform humans into animals using her enchantments. This highlights the potential dangers and supernatural elements that Aeneas and his crew may encounter in this area.&#10;&#10;2) Foreshadowing: The roars of lions, grunts of boars, and howls of wolves mentioned near Circe's shores are indicative of the transformations brought about by Circe. These sounds foreshadow the challenges that Aeneas and his crew may face in their journey, possibly having to confront these monstrous creatures or even be transformed themselves.&#10;&#10;3) Unpredictability: The fact that Circe spends her time in joyous songs, spinning, or weaving suggests a carefree attitude, but she also has the ability to make lions roar, demonstrating her unpredictable nature and potential for causing chaos. This adds an element of uncertainty to Aeneas' journey and the events that may unfold near Circe's shores.&#10;&#10;4) Divine influence: With Circe being the daughter of the Sun, this location is under the watch of a powerful divine figure, which may affect the outcomes of Aeneas' endeavors in this area, either positively or negatively. The propitious Neptune steering their course by night to avoid Circe's monstrous creations indicates that divine intervention can play a significant role in the Trojans' journey near Circe's shores." />
    <node id="At the temple of Janus, when the Roman senate votes for war, the consul declares their decision and symbolically unbars the sounding gates. This ritual marks the beginning of a military campaign, indicating that the war is officially declared and the gods are invoked to watch over the Roman soldiers as they go into battle. The temple of Janus had two steel gates dedicated to Mars, the god of war, which were kept locked in times of peace. The king's role was to unbar these gates and release war, but in this narrative, the king refuses to do so. This is because he abhors the wicked ministry of arms and hides from loud alarms, preferring to keep the gates locked and maintain peace instead of engaging in warfare. The religious significance of this custom highlights the intertwining of Roman society's religious beliefs and practices with major events like wars and conquests." />

    <node id="Juno, in the form of Alecto, is commanding the youthful prince, Turnus, to muster his forces and attack the Trojans immediately. She wants him to destroy the Trojan ships and kill their leaders, ultimately forcing King Latinus to break his promise to Aeneas.&#10;&#10;Turnus responds to his &quot;mother&quot; (Alecto disguised as his mother) with scorn, making it clear that he is already aware of the Phrygian fleet's arrival on the shore. He refuses to be intimidated by her warlike rhetoric and insists that he neither fears nor provokes an unnecessary war since his fate is closely tied to Juno's will. Turnus believes that time has caused Juno to become delusional, as she keeps repeating stories of imagined weapons in her lonely cell, a reference to her fixation on past grievances and her desire to prevent the marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas.&#10;&#10;In his response, Turnus calls for peace and disassociates himself from the impending conflict, placing responsibility for any bloodshed and sacrilegious war on those who insist on opposing him. He then asserts that if anyone must pay the price for this escalation, it will be Turnus himself, who will pray to Heavens for peace but only after it's too late. Ultimately, he dismisses Alecto and allows humans to decide their own fate regarding peace or war.&#10;&#10;These calm yet assertive words only enrage Alecto further, causing her to reveal her true Fury form with snakes on her head, fiery eyes, and a whip. She casts Turnus down as he tries to stand up to her, openly showing her monstrous appearance and threatening demeanor." />

    <node id="The prophecy regarding the marriage of Lavinia, referred to as the &quot;fatal maid,&quot; is that she will marry a foreign prince who will come from an unknown direction. This is symbolized by a swarm of bees landing on the topmost branch of a laurel tree and forming a long cluster. The foreign prince in this prophecy is Aeneas, the Trojan hero.&#10;&#10;The marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas will lead to war and destruction involving Phrygian (Trojan), Latian, and Rutulian blood. This is because Lavinia's marriage to a foreign prince was also foretold to bring war to her homeland, Latium. The Trojans and the Latins, under the leadership of Turnus who also has a claim on Lavinia's hand, will engage in conflict. The war will result in bloodshed from all three groups, leading to great devastation for Latium." />
    <node id="The Trojan ships arrive in Latian land because they are following a prophecy that leads Aeneas to seek a new wife, Lavinia, and establish a new Troy in this kingdom. King Latinus is contemplating significant matters as he rolls his eyes around and fixes them on the ground because he is deeply considering whether to accept the alliance proposed by Aeneas for his daughter's hand in marriage.&#10;&#10;The Trojans, led by Aeneas, willingly sail to Latium with the intention of creating a new home there. This decision is based on the prophecy that Aeneas would find a new wife and establish a new Troy in the prophesied location, which happens to be Latinus' kingdom. Upon their arrival, the Trojans &quot;descend upon the shore, design a town, and...with unhop'd success, th' embassadors return with promis'd peace&quot; (Virgil, Aeneid, Book XII).&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, King Latinus is pondering important decisions related to this alliance. He rolls his eyes around and fixes them on the ground because he is weighing the consequences of accepting or rejecting the Trojan hero's proposal. Latinus is aware of another prophecy that Lavinia will marry a foreign prince who will come from an unknown direction, symbolized by a swarm of bees landing on the topmost branch of a laurel tree and forming a long cluster (Aeneid, Book VII). He recognizes Aeneas as the fulfillment of this prophecy.&#10;&#10;However, Latinus also understands that accepting this alliance will have severe ramifications for his kingdom, leading to war between the Trojans, Latins, and Rutulians. This internal conflict is further fueled by Queen Amata's distressing behavior, which is a result of Alecto, a Fury sent by Juno, manipulating her emotions to incite civil unrest and resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas (Aeneid, Book VII).&#10;&#10;In summary, the Trojan ships arrive in Latian land following a prophecy that guides Aeneas to find a new wife and establish a new Troy there. King Latinus is contemplating significant matters related to this alliance, as he recognizes both the fulfillment of a prophecy and the potential for war in his kingdom." />
    <node id="1. Honor and Crown: The seer's prophecy reveals that Lavinia will be crowned as a queen, indicating her future role as a respected figure in the kingdom of Latium.&#10;2. War and Devastation: However, this positive destiny is accompanied by the news of war caused by her &quot;irrevocable fate.&quot; The country will suffer greatly from this conflict, suggesting that Lavinia's future marriage to a foreign prince will have a significant impact on her homeland, leading to devastation.&#10;3. Fiery Portent: The flames surrounding Lavinia during the religious ceremony symbolize her future role and foreshadow the war that will affect her kingdom. Her association with fire in this portent indicates her connection to Aeneas (the foreign prince), whose troops will come from the same direction as his navy, and whose army will land near where the bees landed on the laurel tree.&#10;4. Foreign Prince: The prophecy mentions a foreign son arriving in Latium who is destined to have a significant role in shaping the future of the kingdom. This mysterious prince is Aeneas, and his arrival will lead both to war and peace in the region.&#10;&#10;In summary, Lavinia's association with flames reveals her honorable future role as a queen but also indicates that her marriage to this foreign prince will lead to war and ultimately change the state of Latium. The seer's prophecy sets the stage for Lavinia's significant role in the narrative while foreshadowing the challenges her kingdom will face due to her destiny." />

The passage highlights her swift movements as she outstrips the winds in speed upon the plain, sweeping the seas, and flying over the fields without harming the bearded grain. Her swift motion is emphasized by people staring at her in surprise, devouring her figure with their eyes as she passes by.&#10;&#10;Overall, Camilla's appearance is one of grace, power, and speed, making her an awe-inspiring figure on the battlefield." />

    <node id="The divine voice reveals to Latinus that he should not seek a foreign alliance, as it goes against the prophecy. Instead, the king is advised to accept the Trojan hero Aeneas' proposal for marriage with Lavinia, his daughter. This union will ensure peace and security in Latium. In this vision, the divine voice warns Latinus: &quot;Yet could not with his art avoid his fate: / For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain, / Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain: / Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art, / She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart; / Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly, / With party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.&quot;&#10;&#10;These lines serve as both a warning and an explanation for Latinus to accept the prophecy. Picus, who was also transformed by a woman's love into a bird (a woodpecker), serves as an example of what happens when one resists their fate or divine will. Therefore, by accepting the union between Aeneas and Lavinia, Latinus ensures peace in his kingdom and avoids any further conflict caused by resisting the prophecy." />

    <node id="1. Queen Amata is urging her husband not to allow Aeneas, the &quot;wandering prince,&quot; to marry Lavinia and become the new king because she had been hoping for her daughter to marry Turnus, a local prince. She is trying to protect both her own desires and Juno's manipulation of those desires through Alecto, who has filled her with disdain for Turnus and Aeneas.&#10;2. By reminding Latinus of his duty to prioritize their family's claim to the throne over the foreigner's claim, Queen Amata is attempting to maintain power within her own kin and prevent an outsider from taking control of Latium.&#10;3. In pointing out that all people are foreign in a larger sense, Queen Amata highlights the irony of Latinus considering a foreigner for the throne while potentially overlooking Turnus, who also has a claim on Lavinia's hand. This statement shows her acknowledgment of the complexities surrounding the concept of foreignness and belonging.&#10;4. Ultimately, Queen Amata is trying to dissuade her husband from accepting Aeneas' proposal by emphasizing the potential dangers of welcoming a foreign prince and the importance of maintaining power within their own family. Her distress and conflict in response to this situation contribute to the impending war between the Latins and the Trojans." />

    <node id="The Fury Alecto, sent by the goddess Juno, plays a pivotal role in instigating war between the Latians and Trojans. She manipulates Queen Amata's emotions, causing her to resist the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, the Trojan guest. Alecto fills Queen Amata with disdain for Turnus and the new Trojan guest, leading her to promote civil unrest and encourage resistance against this marriage.&#10;&#10;This resistance results in conflict and chaos in Latium, ultimately contributing to the impending war between the Latins and the Trojans. The text describes widespread devastation caused by the Fury's influence, with huge piles of slain surrounding the bodies of those killed in battle, indicating that the Latians and Trojans are bathing in each other's blood, and the discord cannot be controlled or ceased by any external force.&#10;&#10;In summary, Alecto's role is to incite war between the Latians and Trojans by manipulating Queen Amata's emotions and promoting resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, which ultimately leads to conflict, chaos, and bloodshed in Latium." />
    <node id="The significant portent in the laurel tree that foreshadows the arrival of a foreign prince connected to Lavinia's betrothal is when a swarm of bees, coming from an unknown direction, lands on the topmost branch and forms a long cluster. This event is interpreted by an ancient augur as a prophecy indicating the future arrival of a foreign prince on Latian shores, whose army will also land near the laurel tree. This prince's connection to Lavinia will be central to the narrative and cause both war and peace in the region. The laurel tree portent indicates that Lavinia's future husband is a foreign prince, who is Aeneas, the Trojan hero." />
    <node id="The Roman king plays a significant role in the declaration of war, as he is responsible for unbarring the steel gates dedicated to Mars, the god of war, before the battlefields. This action symbolizes the invocation of the god of war and signifies that the war has been sanctioned by divine power. However, in the narrative provided, the king refuses to do so due to his aversion towards warfare.&#10;&#10;The gods also play a crucial role in declaring war. The text mentions the temple of Janus, which has two steel gates dedicated to Mars and are kept locked in times of peace. When the Roman senate votes for war, the consul declares their decision by unbarring these gates, indicating that the war is officially declared and invoking the gods' watchfulness over the Roman soldiers as they go into battle.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the goddess Juno plays a significant role in instigating war between the Latins and Trojans by sending the Fury Alecto to manipulate Queen Amata's emotions and promote resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas. The chaos and frenzy caused by this resistance ultimately contribute to the impending war between the two groups.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Eris (Discord) is mentioned in the context of escalating the conflict by spreading news of the war to neighboring nations. However, Juno later instructs her to cease any additional involvement in instigating the war.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Roman king and the gods play essential roles in declaring war, as they are responsible for invoking divine sanction and protection before the battlefields. The gods also influence the events leading up to the war, such as when Juno sends Alecto to manipulate Queen Amata's emotions and cause conflict between the Latins and Trojans." />

Foreign Prince: The prophecy mentions a foreign son arriving in Latium who is destined to have a significant role in shaping the future of the kingdom. This mysterious prince is Aeneas, and his arrival will lead both to war and peace in the region.&#10;&#10;In summary, Lavinia's association with flames reveals her honorable future role as a queen but also indicates that her marriage to this foreign prince will lead to war and ultimately change the state of Latium. The seer's prophecy sets the stage for Lavinia's significant role in the narrative while foreshadowing the challenges her kingdom will face due to her destiny.">

The temple of Janus had two steel gates dedicated to Mars, the god of war, which were kept locked in times of peace. The king's role was to unbar these gates and release war, but in this narrative, the king refuses to do so. This is because he abhors the wicked ministry of arms and hides from loud alarms, preferring to keep the gates locked and maintain peace instead of engaging in warfare.

This ritual marks the beginning of a military campaign, indicating that the war is officially declared and the gods are invoked to watch over the Roman soldiers as they go into battle. The temple of Janus had two steel gates dedicated to Mars, the god of war, which were kept locked in times of peace. The king's role was to unbar these gates and release war, but in this narrative, the king refuses to do so. This is because he abhors the wicked ministry of arms and hides from loud alarms, preferring to keep the gates locked and maintain peace instead of engaging in warfare. The religious significance of this custom highlights the intertwining of Roman society's religious beliefs and practices with major events like wars and conquests.">

The terms of the proposed alliance have not been explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that Aeneas and his Trojan followers would be welcomed into Latium and allowed to settle in the kingdom, potentially sharing power or integrating with the existing society.">

    <edge source="The Fury Alecto, sent by the goddess Juno, plays a pivotal role in instigating war between the Latians and Trojans. She manipulates Queen Amata's emotions, causing her to resist the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, the Trojan guest. Alecto fills Queen Amata with disdain for Turnus and the new Trojan guest, leading her to promote civil unrest and encourage resistance against this marriage.&#10;&#10;This resistance results in conflict and chaos in Latium, ultimately contributing to the impending war between the Latins and the Trojans. The text describes widespread devastation caused by the Fury's influence, with huge piles of slain surrounding the bodies of those killed in battle, indicating that the Latians and Trojans are bathing in each other's blood, and the discord cannot be controlled or ceased by any external force.&#10;&#10;In summary, Alecto's role is to incite war between the Latians and Trojans by manipulating Queen Amata's emotions and promoting resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas, which ultimately leads to conflict, chaos, and bloodshed in Latium." target="The Roman king plays a significant role in the declaration of war, as he is responsible for unbarring the steel gates dedicated to Mars, the god of war, before the battlefields. This action symbolizes the invocation of the god of war and signifies that the war has been sanctioned by divine power. However, in the narrative provided, the king refuses to do so due to his aversion towards warfare.&#10;&#10;The gods also play a crucial role in declaring war. The text mentions the temple of Janus, which has two steel gates dedicated to Mars and are kept locked in times of peace. When the Roman senate votes for war, the consul declares their decision by unbarring these gates, indicating that the war is officially declared and invoking the gods' watchfulness over the Roman soldiers as they go into battle.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the goddess Juno plays a significant role in instigating war between the Latins and Trojans by sending the Fury Alecto to manipulate Queen Amata's emotions and promote resistance against the prophesied marriage between Lavinia and Aeneas. The chaos and frenzy caused by this resistance ultimately contribute to the impending war between the two groups.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Eris (Discord) is mentioned in the context of escalating the conflict by spreading news of the war to neighboring nations. However, Juno later instructs her to cease any additional involvement in instigating the war.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Roman king and the gods play essential roles in declaring war, as they are responsible for invoking divine sanction and protection before the battlefields. The gods also influence the events leading up to the war, such as when Juno sends Alecto to manipulate Queen Amata's emotions and cause conflict between the Latins and Trojans.">

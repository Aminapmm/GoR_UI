    <node id="1. Roddie is making efforts to save his friend Ida by attempting to climb down the half-ruined manway in the dark to reach her, even though the other person (who plans to kill Ida) believes it's too dangerous and difficult.&#10;2. Roddie also decides not to harm Ida despite the fact that her survival threatens his mission, because he wants to prove himself to his friends and does not want her death to be the solution to his problem.&#10;3. After finding Ida on the twisted metal cylinder, Roddie continues to climb down with her, even though it is making him dizzy and afraid due to the steep curve and height.&#10;4. Roddie successfully reaches Ida and discovers the need to kill her in order to prevent her from revealing critical information about an invasion route to the enemy. However, he decides not to do so when Ida starts crying and begging for her life.&#10;5. Instead of killing Ida, Roddie goes on to find food and water for both of them, carrying Ida on his back to demonstrate his superior strength. He then climbs up a tall rust tower with Ida, where they find sanctuary and sleep for several hours.&#10;6. Currently, Roddie and Ida are located near the ocean on top of a tall rust tower. They have a clear view of the surrounding area, including Mount Tamalpais to the north, Twin Peaks to the south, Mount Diablo to the east, and the land of gold (the setting sun) to the west over the ocean." />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;It isn't reasonable to kill you now,&quot; he said. &quot;Too dark. You can't possibly get down that half-ruined manway tonight, so let's see how I feel in the morning.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ida began to weep again, and Roddie found it necessary to comfort her.&#10; &#10; And by morning he knew he was a Man." />
    <node id=" guard-ropes or handgrips—she simply fell. That would solve his problem.&#10; &#10; Except it wouldn't be his solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to his friends.&#10; &#10; He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog that billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along the top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve steepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.&#10; &#10; Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when he'd followed.&#10; &#10; But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would admit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at every downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only his holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her and looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced by the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in sight.&#10; &#10; Up" />
    <node id=" ocean lay the land of gold—of all the kinds of gold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small portion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed to have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its color.&#10; &#10; Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no interest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes, Roddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.&#10; &#10; Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which Invaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins of the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable over the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was the advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on the water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need to kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.&#10; &#10; Roddie took the hammer from his waist.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't! Oh, don't!&quot; Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her face with scratched and bloodied hands.&#10; &#10; Surprised, Roddie" />
    <node id=" of you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.&quot;&#10; &#10; Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he had previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting a pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had grubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose. Picking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed an end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained spinach or squash.&#10; &#10; &quot;Baby food!&quot; she muttered. &quot;Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat baby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you happen to know where to find it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, this is the northern end of the city,&quot; he answered, shrugging.&#10;&quot;I've been here before.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why did the soldier let us go?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This watch,&quot; he said, touching the radium dial. &quot;It's a talisman.&quot;&#10; &#10; But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She was silent" />
    <node id=" alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.&#10; &#10; He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog thinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last hundred feet to sanctuary.&#10; &#10; They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within the tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and slept for several hours.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip. Limping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings they looked out on a strange and isolated world.&#10; &#10; To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount Tamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy white sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons on a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding, tallest of the peaks and most forbidding.&#10; &#10; But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold—of all the kinds of gold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small portion of the setting sun glared" />
    <node id=". &quot;It's getting gray out. You'll see me soon enough.&quot;&#10; &#10; But she'd see him , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.&#10; &#10; &quot;What'll we do when it's light?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, I guess the boats have gone,&quot; Ida said. &quot;You could swim the Gate, I guess—you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll think it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it over from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!&quot;&#10; &#10; Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even her own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there were a way over the bridge....&#10; &#10; &quot;It's broken,&quot; he said. &quot;How in the world can we cross it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I—I don't want to be alone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?&quot;&#10; &#10; Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed her— if nothing happened when she saw him.&#10; &#10; U" />
    <node id="1. Ida, a member of the resistance, explains that their continued fighting is necessary because the city is their home and they rely on the raids for tools and other necessities. She also mentions the importance of keeping the soldiers occupied in guarding the city, as it makes them less likely to attack.&#10;2. Ida's perspective highlights the idea that the resistance fighters view themselves as the true protectors and owners of the city, despite the superior strength and capabilities of the soldiers. They believe that surrendering or stopping their fight would mean giving up their home and allowing the soldiers (who they see as inferior) to take over.&#10;3. Additionally, Ida's conversation with Roddie reveals her belief that their struggle is ultimately about identity, as she repeatedly emphasizes that they are both &quot;Men&quot; – meaning human beings – despite being on opposite sides of the conflict. This further underscores why the resistance chooses to continue fighting, as giving up would mean letting go of their sense of self and belonging.&#10;&#10;In summary, the resistance continues to fight to preserve their home, maintain their way of life, and assert their identity as the true protectors of the city. They recognize that the soldiers are effective in guarding the city and deterring attacks, but believe that their own role is critical for the survival of humanity within the city." />
    <node id=" When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's assertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if she felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of what the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an Invader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.&#10; &#10; Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.&#10; &#10; For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do any good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most direct route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and she began to talk.&#10; &#10; Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless to him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had been.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's awful,&quot; Ida said. &quot;So few young men are left, so many casualties....&#10; &#10; &quot;But why do you—we—keep up the fight?&quot; Roddie asked. &quot;I mean, the soldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and they can't leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll be plenty of" />
    <node id=" leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and they can't leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll be plenty of young men.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well!&quot; said Ida, sharply. &quot;You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever tell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep us out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our tools and things?&quot;&#10; &#10; She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance. But she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too close for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder every few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.&#10; &#10; He went on with his questioning. &quot;Why are you here? I mean, sure, the others are after tools and things, but what's your purpose?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ida shrugged. &quot;I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,&quot; she said,&#10;&quot;but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no weapon.&quot;&#10; &#10; She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of" />
    <node id=" operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie was new at his work, and took it seriously. It alarmed him to watch the soldiers melt away, gradually succumbing to battle damage, shamed him to see the empty ruins burn section by section as the Invaders repeatedly broke through and had to be burned out.&#10; &#10; Soon there would be nothing left of the Private Property Keep Out that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to them when driven away by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers themselves would be gone. None would remain to guard the city but a few strayed servants like Molly, and an occasional Civil Defender.&#10; &#10; And himself, Roddie reflected, spitting savagely into the fire. He might remain. But how he fitted into the picture, he didn't know. And Molly, who claimed to have found him in the ruins after a fight with Invaders twenty years before, couldn't or wouldn't say.&#10; &#10; Well, for as long as possible, Roddie decided, he'd do his duty as the others did theirs—single-mindedly. Eventually the soldiers might accept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first aid was useful to them.&#10; &#10; He gave the" />
    <node id=" Each of us helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and end it by destroying it. My people must be the true Men, because they're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to let you escape.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in cold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two? Don't—don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?&quot;&#10; &#10; She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet somehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said nothing.&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind!&quot; Ida said viciously. &quot;You can't make me beg. Go ahead and kill—see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the city regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack friends, too! Men can accomplish anything!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Scornfully she turned and looked toward the western twilight. It was Roddie's turn to stand and stare.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id=" don't!&quot; Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her face with scratched and bloodied hands.&#10; &#10; Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and, weeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends. Ida's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why should you cry?&quot; he asked comfortingly. &quot;You know your people will come back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But—but my people are your people, too,&quot; Ida wailed. &quot;It's so senseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your friends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men—and the city is ours, not theirs!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It can't be,&quot; Roddie objected. &quot;The city surely belongs to those who are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to me. Each of us has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be aimless. Each of us helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and end it by destroying it. My people must be the true Men, because they're so" />
    <node id="1. The story describes Roddie walking toward a manhole, which was his hiding place during his adolescence. He had difficulty finding the bronze bar, which he typically uses as a roller to move the heavy cover from below and as a support to keep it ajar for ventilation.&#10;2. The text does not provide explicit information on why Roddie could not locate the bronze bar. It could be that the area was dark and disorganized, making it hard for him to find the bar. Alternatively, there might have been some changes in the environment that prevented the bronze bar from being where he usually kept it.&#10;3. Regardless of the reason, Roddie's inability to find the bronze bar caused him to struggle when opening the manhole and created challenges for his safety and ventilation." />

Some distance off, an owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and rustle as they scampered.&#10; &#10; The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as an irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even in the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the One who'd built him must have been an apprentice.&#10; &#10; For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now walked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of how much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock itself a difference to be hidden.&#10; &#10; His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A weathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was the levering key that opened its door.&#10;  Everything was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of course that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to move the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for ventilation.&#10; &#10; But the example of his" />
    <node id=" was a roller on which to move the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for ventilation.&#10; &#10; But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry out every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all obstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against everything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even him out when he was aflame....&#10; &#10; Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling. He lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the street, and felt with his feet for the top rung.&#10; &#10; Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but saw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could have entered through the iron cover?&#10; &#10; He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom.&#10; &#10; It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body heat, as if a large animal had recently rested there!&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready for an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand" />

But, say, how are we going to get away from here?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and rising. &quot;How did you get in?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the dust and they led me here. Where were you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Scouting around,&quot; Roddie said vaguely. &quot;How did you know I was a man when I came back?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these androids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!&quot;&#10; &#10; Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find him whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the manhole would help him now to redeem himself....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd like to get a look at you,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; The girl laughed self-consciously. &quot;It's getting gray out.

    <node id=" &#10;&#10; &#10; Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready for an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the darkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over that curving surface for identifying features.&#10; &#10; While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly seized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage kick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an unexpected voice.&#10; &#10; &quot;Get your filthy hands off me!&quot; it whispered angrily. &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot;&#10; &#10; Startled, he dropped his hammer. &quot;I'm Roddie,&quot; he said, squatting to fumble for it. &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls are there in this raiding party?&quot;&#10; &#10; His first Invader—and he had dropped his weapon!&#10; &#10; Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused suddenly. This girl—whatever that was—seemed to think him one of her own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn" />
    <node id="mindedly. Eventually the soldiers might accept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first aid was useful to them.&#10; &#10; He gave the fire a final poke and then paused, wondering if, when heated, his screwdriver could make an unfastened end of wire stick on the grayish spot where it seemed to belong.&#10; &#10; Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out his new idea, Roddie got too close to the flames. Instantly the room filled with the stench of singed hair. Roddie drew angrily back, beating out the sparks in his uncut blond mane.&#10; &#10; As he stood slapping his head and muttering, a deranged Civil Defense firefighter popped into the doorway and covered him with carbon dioxide foam.&#10; &#10; Roddie fled. His life-long friends were not merely wearing out, they were unbearably wearing.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; In the street, even before he'd wiped off the foam, he regretted his flight. The fire was back home. And here in the cold of this fog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble, the diaper he wore felt inadequate against" />
    <node id="1) Roddie knew where to find baby food because he had previously been to the northern end of the city, where the supermarket was located. This is revealed when Ida asks him why he knows where to find it, and he responds, &quot;Well, this is the northern end of the city. I've been here before.&quot;&#10;&#10;2) The radium dial watch is significant in their escape from the soldier because it serves as a talisman that allows Roddie and Ida to go free. When the soldier asks Roddie why he is letting them go, Roddie responds, &quot;This watch. It's a talisman.&quot; While the exact reason for its effectiveness is not specified in the story, it is clear that the soldier perceives the watch as having some sort of power or importance and decides to let them go because of it." />
    <node id=" and thrust her knitting needles into his eyes.&#10; &#10; Roddie jumped behind him, knocked off his helmet, and pressed a soft spot on his conical skull. The soldier collapsed to the floor.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Roddie salvaged and returned Molly's needles. Then he examined the patient, tearing him apart as a boy dismembers an alarm clock.&#10; &#10; It was lucky he did. The left arm's pair of hands suddenly writhed off the floor in an effort to choke him. But because the arm was detached at the shoulder and therefore blind, he escaped the clutching onslaught and could goad the reflexing hands into assaulting one another harmlessly.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Meanwhile, the other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another casualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into the fire. By the time Roddie had hauled him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie swore, then decided to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces of the other to make a whole one.&#10; &#10; To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie was new at his work, and took it seriously. It alarmed him to watch the soldiers melt away," />

He looked contemptuous, hostile.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;It's all right,&quot; Roddie said, his voice breaking.&#10; &#10; There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned and walked away.&#10; &#10; Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie turned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to his. He grimaced and turned away his head.&#10; &#10; Ida's response was quick. &quot;Forgive me,&quot; she breathed, and slipped from his arms, but she held herself erect. &quot;I was so scared. And then we've had no sleep, no food or water.&quot;&#10; &#10; Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to deny his own humiliating needs.&#10; &#10; &quot;I guess you're not as strong as me,&quot; he said smugly. &quot;I'll take care of you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.&quot;&#10; &#10; Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the" />

Roddie paused on his way down the iron ladder while entering the manhole because he sensed that something had entered through the iron cover, but he saw, listened, and sniffed to find nothing.&#10;2. Upon investigating in the darkness, Roddie found something warm and softish. He used touch to feel for identifying features and was startled when this unknown entity seized and bit his hand, kicked his shin, and whispered angrily at him.&#10;3. These actions caused Roddie to take out his hammer and be prepared for a swift attack, thinking that the unknown entity might be hostile." />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10; &#10; Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed her— if nothing happened when she saw him.&#10; &#10; Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.&#10; &#10; A giggle broke the pause. &quot;It's nice of you to wait and let me go first up the ladder,&quot; the girl said. &quot;But where the heck is the rusty old thing?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll go first,&quot; said Roddie. He might need the advantage. &quot;The ladder's right behind me.&quot;&#10; &#10; He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from street level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously fingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.&#10; &#10; She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her shapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet that were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.&#10; &#10; Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that would make things easy when the time came.&#10; &#10; He looked into her face. It smiled at him, t" />
    <node id="1. Roddie's decision not to harm Ida, despite her being a threat to his mission, demonstrates his capacity for empathy and compassion, which are hallmarks of maturity and humanity.&#10;2. By choosing to save Ida rather than kill her, Roddie is prioritizing human life over his own goals and showing that he values Ida's worth as a person.&#10;3. Roddie's actions in finding food and water for both of them, carrying Ida on his back, and climbing up the rust tower to find sanctuary further illustrate his commitment to protecting and caring for Ida, even at personal risk to himself.&#10;4. These choices and actions reflect a level of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and social responsibility that are indicative of maturity and humanity.&#10;5. Additionally, Roddie's decision to pause and comfort Ida when she begins to weep again shows his ability to recognize and respond to the emotions of others, further solidifying his growth into a mature and empathetic human being." />
    <node id="Based on the story, you are a character named Roddie who is part of an invasion force. The invaders have advanced technology, including androids and the ability to locate each other in the dark using heat signatures. You seem to be different from the rest of the invaders, as you don't have the same knowledge or capabilities they do.&#10;&#10;You are currently stranded in the northern end of the city with a girl named Ida, who believes you are also an invader like her. According to Ida, there was fog and tide that caused boats (presumably carrying invasion forces) to be separated. She stowed away on one of the boats when it was dark and the fog had settled down, indicating that she didn't want to be with the main group.&#10;&#10;You told Ida that you stayed behind with the wounded, which is why you don't have a weapon. Ida also mentions that there is a lack of men among the invaders, suggesting that the invasion force consists mostly or entirely of women.&#10;&#10;The situation involves an invasion force trying to make their way through a city, possibly Alcatraz, with some members being separated and stranded. You, as Roddie, are in the company of Ida, who believes you're one of her own kind, but you have not revealed your true identity to her yet." />
    <node id=" This girl—whatever that was—seemed to think him one of her own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn delay to advantage.

What was a boat? &quot;How would I know?&quot; he repeated, voice tight with fear of discovery.&#10; &#10; If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper was friendly enough. &quot;Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then. They shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too.

Do you think I was being silly?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, but you do seem a little purposeless.&quot;&#10; &#10; In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and concrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over the water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they could see the beginning of the bridge approach.&#10; &#10; A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and clung to Roddie's arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;Behind me!&quot; he whispered urgently. &quot;Get behind me and hold on!&quot;&#10; &#10; He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back below the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.&#10;" />

She followed his footprints in the dust and they led her to the manhole.&#10;&#10;2) Roddie wants her to see him now because he has decided not to kill her immediately, as it is too dark for him to ensure his safety. He plans to learn something of value from her before killing her, which might help him gain acceptance from the soldiers. He also wants her to reveal the route out of the manhole before he kills her." />
    <node id="1. When the group of soldiers reported victory to their commander, Roddie, he inspected them and noticed that one soldier had a severely injured left arm.&#10;2. The soldier with the injury unexpectedly charged at Roddie with a bayonet after Molly stepped in to protect him.&#10;3. Roddie handled the situation by quickly knocking off the soldier's helmet and pressing on a soft spot on his conical skull, causing the soldier to collapse.&#10;4. This resulted in the soldier being incapacitated and no longer posing a threat to Roddie or Molly." />

All were scratched and dented, but one in particular seemed badly damaged. His left arm was almost severed at the shoulder.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come here, fellow,&quot; Roddie said. &quot;Let's see if I can fix that.&quot;&#10; &#10; The soldier took a step forward, lurched suddenly, stopped, and whipped out a bayonet.&#10; &#10; &quot;Death to Invaders!&quot; he yelled, and charged crazily.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Molly stepped in front of him.&#10; &#10; &quot;You aren't being very nice to my baby,&quot; she murmured, and thrust her knitting needles into his eyes.&#10; &#10; Roddie jumped behind him, knocked off his helmet, and pressed a soft spot on his con" />

As always when Invaders broke in from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while the soldiers went out to fight.&#10; &#10; And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He felt almost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted in that grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, &quot;The soldiers don't want little boys. The soldiers don't want little boys. The soldiers don't—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm not a little boy!&quot; Roddie suddenly shouted. &quot;I'm full-grown and I've never even seen an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?&quot;&#10; &#10; Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder. She rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject.&#10; &#10; &quot;A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse—&quot; she chanted.&#10; &#10; Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched.

But this time, though it stopped the kindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse.&#10; &#10; &quot;Wuzzums hungry?&quot; Molly cooed, still rocking.&#10; &#10; Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck.&#10; &#10; It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had cared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him a mechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He was still tinkering when the soldiers came in. While they lined up along the wall, he put Molly's head back on her neck.&#10; &#10; She gaped coyly at the new arrivals. &quot;Hello, boys,&quot; she simpered.&#10;&quot;Looking for a good time?&quot;&#10; &#10; Roddie slapped her to silence, reflecting briefly that there were many things he didn't know about Molly. But there was work to be done.

He does this so that he can stare at her in the thin gray dawn and assess if she poses any threat to him." />
    <node id="1. The situation with Roddie and his use of Molly is that he has turned her into a weapon by having her pose as a human girl. He does this to protect himself from potential threats from the soldiers who have entered the room. When the soldiers see Molly, they are taken aback and unsure of how to react, which gives Roddie an advantage.&#10;2. The purpose of Roddie making the soldiers report to Molly is to further emphasize her perceived humanity and to create a sense of confusion and unease among the soldiers. By having them report to a doll as if she were their commander, Roddie is challenging their perceptions of reality and exploiting their instincts to follow orders. This serves to disorient and intimidate the soldiers, making them easier for Roddie to control." />
    <node id="1. Roddie's primary role in the story is that of a soldier or commander leading a group of surviving defenders in a war-torn city. His past remains shrouded in mystery, including how he became heat-sensitive like Molly and gained the ability to turn invisible in darkness.&#10;2. Roddie has taken on the responsibility of doing first aid for the soldiers under his command despite their initial mistrust and fear of him due to his unusual abilities. This decision highlights Roddie's commitment to their mission, even as he questions his place among them.&#10;3. The mysterious circumstances surrounding Roddie's past include his ability to become invisible in darkness, heat-sensitivity similar to Molly's, and the fact that he spent his adolescence hiding in a manhole. These peculiar traits set him apart from other soldiers and contribute to their initial apprehension towards him.&#10;4. Despite these challenges, Roddie continues to perform his duty as a commander by leading and caring for his soldiers, demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of adversity." />
    <node id="Based on the supporting materials and story excerpts provided, Roddie considers killing Ida because she possesses critical information about an invasion route that, if revealed to the enemy, could put his mission and fellow soldiers at risk. This is indicated by Roddie taking out his hammer from his waist, a weapon he plans to use to neutralize Ida. However, he ultimately decides not to go through with it when Ida begins to cry and beg for her life. Instead, he chooses to prioritize human life over his mission goals and finds food, water, and sanctuary for both of them. This decision reflects Roddie's emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and social responsibility, further solidifying his growth into a mature and empathetic human being." />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information on why Roddie could not locate the weathered bronze bar. It is likely that the area was dark and disorganized, making it hard for him to find the bar. Alternatively, there might have been some changes in the environment that prevented the bronze bar from being where he usually kept it. Regardless of the reason, Roddie's inability to find the bronze bar caused him to struggle when opening the manhole and created challenges for his safety and ventilation." />
    <node id="1. Roddie is attempting to save his friend Ida by climbing down the half-ruined manway in the dark to reach her, even though it is making him dizzy and afraid due to the steep curve and height.

This decision demonstrates his capacity for empathy, compassion, and self-sacrifice, which are hallmarks of maturity and humanity." />

The pavement ended just beyond the cable anchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling support wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was trapped.&#10; &#10; He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly would, to finish the job....&#10; &#10; But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she dashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved steel surface.&#10; &#10; For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the ever-steepening catenary until—because there were no guard-ropes or handgrips—she simply fell.

However, once inside the manhole, Roddie encountered something warm and softish, which turned out to be a girl named Ida.&#10;4.

Here, difficult going demanded full attention.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to look as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of concrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the unwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked girders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.&#10; &#10; Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads made a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.&#10; &#10; Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.&#10; &#10; &quot;What are you trying to do?&quot; he demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm taking you with me,&quot; Ida said firmly. &quot;Taking you where you belong!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; he blurted, drawing his hammer. &quot;I can't go, nor let you go.

He wants to learn something of value from her before killing her and reveal the route out of the manhole.&#10;3. Roddie is cautious and senses that something has entered the manhole through the iron cover. He uses his senses of sight, hearing, and smell but does not detect anything unusual. When he encounters the girl, named Ida, she startles him by seizing and biting his hand, kicking his shin, and whispering angrily at him, causing Roddie to take out his hammer in self-defense.&#10;4. Based on these interactions and descriptions, it can be determined that Roddie is cautious, mistrustful, and willing to use violence when necessary for self-defense. The girls, Molly and Ida, are perceptive, brave, and willing to defend themselves against potential threats." />
    <node id="In this story, Roddie, a soldier with unusual abilities such as heat-sensitivity and invisibility in darkness, uses his mechanical companion Molly as a weapon and a source of confusion among the soldiers. He has turned Molly into a human girl pose to protect himself and disorient the soldiers. When the soldiers report to Molly as if she were their commander, it challenges their perceptions of reality and makes them easier for Roddie to control. During an inspection, Roddie notices a soldier with a severely injured arm, who later charges at him with a bayonet.

    <node id="1. Roddie's realization of his maturity was prompted by the decision he made not to harm Ida, despite her being a threat to his mission. This decision demonstrated his capacity for empathy, compassion, and self-sacrifice, which are hallmarks of maturity and humanity.&#10;2. Roddie decided to spare Ida's life until morning because it was too dark for him to kill her or for her to escape down the half-ruined manway safely. He also recognized that she was afraid and emotional, which further solidified his decision not to harm her. This decision showed that he prioritized human life over his mission goals and valued Ida's worth as a person.&#10;3. Additionally, Roddie's actions of finding food and water for both of them, carrying Ida on his back, and climbing up the rust tower to find sanctuary further illustrate his commitment to protecting and caring for Ida, even at personal risk to himself. These choices and actions reflect a level of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and social responsibility that are indicative of maturity and humanity.&#10;4.

    <node id="1. Roddie is trying to accomplish rescuing his friend Ida by scrambling along a rusty cable in thick fog, despite pain, fatigue, and fear. This action demonstrates his determination, courage, and loyalty towards his friend, as well as his willingness to put her safety above his own comfort and well-being. By doing so, Roddie is further solidifying his growth into a mature and empathetic human being, as he values Ida's life over the potential success of his mission. This decision also reflects Roddie's emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and social responsibility in prioritizing human connection and compassion over personal goals or objectives." />
    <node id="According to Ida, the resistance fighters view themselves as the rightful owners of the city. They believe that surrendering or stopping their fight would mean giving up their home and allowing the soldiers (who they see as inferior) to take over. On the other hand, Roddie does not explicitly express his perspective on who the rightful owners of the city are, but he is depicted as a soldier guarding the city and protecting it from attack.&#10;&#10;The source of their conflict is rooted in their differing beliefs about identity and ownership of the city. Ida sees their struggle as ultimately about identity, emphasizing that she and Roddie are both &quot;Men&quot; – meaning human beings – despite being on opposite sides of the conflict. She insists that Roddie belongs with her and the resistance fighters, suggesting that she knows or suspects his true identity and intentions.

Roddie is also self-aware and emotionally intelligent, as shown by his ability to recognize and respond to Ida's emotions, such as when he comforts her after she begins to weep again.&#10;3. Ida is a frightened and vulnerable individual, as evidenced by her tears and pleading for her life when Roddie considers harming her. She may also be in a desperate situation, given that she has critical information about an invasion route that the enemy would want to obtain.&#10;4. Despite her fear and vulnerability, Ida is determined to protect herself and her secret, as shown by her initial aggressive behavior towards Roddie when he encounters her in the manhole.&#10;5.

Roddie paused on his way down the iron ladder while entering the manhole because he sensed that something had entered through the iron cover. He uses his senses of sight, hearing, and smell but does not detect anything unusual. Once inside the manhole, he encounters something warm and softish, which turns out to be a girl named Ida. This unknown entity startles him by seizing and biting his hand, kicking his shin, and whispering angrily at him, causing Roddie to take out his hammer in self-defense. However, the story does not explicitly state that Roddie considers killing Ida in this situation.">

They believe that surrendering or stopping their fight would mean giving up their home and allowing the soldiers (who they see as inferior) to take over.

    <edge source="In this story, Roddie, a soldier with unusual abilities such as heat-sensitivity and invisibility in darkness, uses his mechanical companion Molly as a weapon and a source of confusion among the soldiers. He has turned Molly into a human girl pose to protect himself and disorient the soldiers. When the soldiers report to Molly as if she were their commander, it challenges their perceptions of reality and makes them easier for Roddie to control.

He does this to protect himself from potential threats from the soldiers who have entered the room. When the soldiers see Molly, they are taken aback and unsure of how to react, which gives Roddie an advantage.&#10;2. The ritual words that Roddie recites are significant because they are part of his strategy to further emphasize Molly's perceived humanity and create a sense of confusion and unease among the soldiers. By having them report to a doll as if she were their commander, Roddie is challenging their perceptions of reality and exploiting their instincts to follow orders. This serves to disorient and intimidate the soldiers, making them easier for Roddie to control.&#10;3. At this point in the story, Roddie has decided not to kill Molly immediately, as it is too dark for him to ensure his safety. He plans to learn something of value from her before killing her, which might help him gain acceptance from the soldiers.

    <node id="In this story excerpt, Sam Burnett is expressing his sense of duty and responsibility towards the children who rely on the Constellation to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones in space. He emphasizes that after three thousand days of service, it would be wrong for them to return to Center Base without a full cargo, as they have always done before. By filling the shelves with the bodies of those who have lost their lives in space, they are providing a valuable service that allows the children of these individuals to &quot;sleep easy on the good green earth&quot; knowing their loved ones will receive a proper burial. Burnett is concerned that if they fail to do this, they may be letting down not only the families of those who have died but also the long history and tradition of the Constellation's mission." />
    <node id=" kids who'll never have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.&quot; His voice trailed off. &quot;You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago—&quot;&#10; &#10; Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of them out:&#10; &#10; &quot;Rice?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah, Sam?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We haven't got a full cargo, boy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Full enough for me, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there—number ninety-eight is Lethla—number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back any way—but—the way—we used to—&quot;&#10; &#10; His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and Burnett was lying" />
    <node id=" him back like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.&#10; &#10; Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and started laughing.&#10; &#10; He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.&#10; &#10; Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's young face over him. Burnett groaned.&#10; &#10; Rice said, &quot;Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To hell with it.&quot; Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open. Something wet and sticky covered his chest. &quot;I said this was my last trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is the hard way—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.&quot; His voice trailed off. &quot;You watch the shelves fill up and you never know" />
    <node id=" he's smart. Every precaution is taken to protect that one.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But Lethla! His body must mean something!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a battle-cuiser to go against him?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll radio for help?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,&#10;&quot;You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's barrel-chest. &quot;Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who start out smiling and get the smile burned off" />
    <node id=" was talking. It sounded deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.&#10; &#10; Rice said:&#10; &#10; &quot;Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day drunk!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships, salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.&#10; &#10; Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.&#10; &#10; Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved for action.&#10; &#10; This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!&#10; &#10; &quot;Sam!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative lab, bounded" />
    <node id=" soldiers from all further harm.&#10; &#10; Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship. Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor warrior's body out of the void.&#10; &#10; He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke, who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a decent burial.&#10; &#10; &quot;Number ninety-eight.&quot; Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.&#10; &#10; &quot;Number ninety-eight,&quot; Burnett repeated. &quot;Working on ninety-five, ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight surgery.&quot; Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.&#10; &#10; Rice said:&#10; &#10; &quot;Boyohbody! Two more pick" />
    <node id=" of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe to Venus.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lethla bowed slightly. &quot;Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Precious is the word for you, brother!&quot; said Rice.&#10; &#10; &quot;Enough!&quot; Lethla moved his gun several inches.&#10; &#10; &quot;Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be picked up— now! &quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time in years. &quot;Sure,&quot; said Sam, smiling. &quot;We'll pick him up.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No tricks,&quot; said Lethla.&#10; &#10; Burnett scowled and smiled together. &quot;No tricks. You'll have Kriere on board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Follow me up the ladder.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. &quot;Come on.&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor. Rice grumbled and cursed after him.&#10; &#10; On the way up, Burnett" />
    <node id="1. Burnett agreed to help Lethla pick up Kriere because he saw an opportunity to end the war by capturing the All-Mighty Kriere, who had been responsible for much of the conflict. This would also mean the end of the &quot;blind searching&quot; and the shelves full of sleeping warriors.&#10;2. Another motivation for Burnett could be that helping Lethla might ensure his own safety and that of Rice. Lethla had hinted at the possibility of them coming out alive if they cooperated.&#10;3. However, it's important to note that Burnett harbored doubts about this plan due to the presence of many warriors sleeping on numbered shelves in the dim corridors of the long years. These dead lips were &quot;stirring to life&quot; in his ears, suggesting that he felt a sense of duty or loyalty towards the war effort.&#10;4. Lastly, Burnett might have also been motivated by the prospect of completing &quot;the last trip,&quot; as capturing Kriere could potentially end the war and bring about peace. This idea seems to appeal to him, despite his initial reluctance and tiredness." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; It reached Kriere.&#10; &#10; Burnett inhaled a deep breath.&#10; &#10; The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lethla watched.&#10; &#10; He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: &quot;You know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the head, which was carefully preserved for identification.&#10; &#10; That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.&#10; &#10; Burnett spun about and leaped.&#10; &#10; The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.&#10; &#10; Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.&#10; &#10; Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and screaming." />
    <node id=" Burnett turned to Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.&#10; &#10; If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that—&#10; &#10; Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat, water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored because of his gun.&#10; &#10; Kriere would make odds impossible.&#10; &#10; Something had to be done before Kriere came in.&#10; &#10; Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered, fooled—somehow. But—how?&#10; &#10; Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder" />
    <node id=" a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.&#10; &#10; Burnett rubbed his jaw. &quot;Well?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and black. &quot;Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's Lethla!&quot; Rice retorted.&#10; &#10; Burnett said, &quot;Lethla?&quot; And then: &quot;Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That right?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in space, then Kriere's not far away from him!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell. What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and" />
    <node id=" toward the sun at a slow pace.&#10; &#10; Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape? See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out alive; if they cooperated.&#10; &#10; But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored.&#10;  You may never catch up with the war again.&#10; &#10; &#10; The last trip!&#10; &#10; Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?&#10; &#10; Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms, wet thin lips.&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, where do you want this crate?&quot; he asked Lethla easily.&#10; &#10; Lethla exhaled softly. &quot;Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.&quot;" />
    <node id=" face was spoiled by the new bitterness in it.&#10; &#10; Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.&#10; &#10; He smiled. &quot;That's better. Now. We can talk—&quot;&#10; &#10; Rice said it, slow:&#10; &#10; &quot;Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead men belong here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lethla's gun grip tightened. &quot;More talk of that nature, and only dead men there will be.&quot; He blinked. &quot;But first—we must rescue Kriere....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Kriere!&quot; Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.&#10; &#10; Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama. Lethla's voice came next:&#10; &#10; &quot;Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in" />
    <node id="Based on the story and the supporting materials, Burnett's true motivation for considering to cooperate with Lethla and capture Kriere is a combination of several factors. Firstly, he sees it as an opportunity to end the war by capturing the All-Mighty Kriere, who has been responsible for much of the conflict. This would also mean the end of the &quot;blind searching&quot; and the shelves full of sleeping warriors. Secondly, helping Lethla might ensure his own safety and that of Rice. Lastly, Burnett is motivated by the prospect of completing &quot;the last trip,&quot; as capturing Kriere could potentially end the war and bring about peace. Despite his initial reluctance and doubts, these motivations drive him to cooperate with Lethla and capture Kriere." />
    <node id=" loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about to be rescued.&#10; &#10; Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he was about to end a ten-years' war.&#10; &#10; There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be fast.&#10; &#10; Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies from space.&#10; &#10; Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet, too.&#10; &#10; The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its slowness.&#10; &#10; It reached Kriere.&#10; &#10; Burnett inhaled a deep breath.&#10; &#10; The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its" />
    <node id="1. The body of the enemy official appears &quot;a little too dead&quot; to both Rice and Burnett. This observation is what initially arouses their suspicion." />
    <node id=" all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.&#10; &#10; You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be. After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing your job with mechanical hands.&#10; &#10; But even a machine breaks down....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sam!&quot; Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder. Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy official. &quot;Take a look at this!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it was.&#10; &#10; Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.&#10; &#10; Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way, stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed close to a" />
    <node id=" didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what language it would use if it had to.&#10; &#10; Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it like a dead cold star.&#10; &#10; Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight, biting lines into his sharp face.&#10; &#10; Rice got it out, finally. &quot;How'd you do it?&quot; he demanded, bitterly.&#10;&quot;How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!&quot;&#10; &#10; A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You never catch up with the war!&#10; &#10; &#10; But what if the war catches up with you?&#10; &#10; What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the chugging of" />
    <node id="'d know the reason why!&#10; &#10; &quot;Sam!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood cooling in it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed without making any noise on the rungs.&#10; &#10; He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget.&#10;  You never catch up with the war.&#10; &#10; &#10; All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the" />
    <node id=" got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a million miles.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?&quot;&#10; &#10; Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to dissolve.&#10; &#10; Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.&#10; &#10; He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed, thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.&#10; &#10; And then he said softly:&#10; &#10; &quot; One hundred. &quot;" />
    <node id="Based on Sam Burnett's experience in the Venus-Earth conflict, he infers that Kriere might have been in an accident as well, given that his right-hand man, Lethla, is now dead and their ship was attacked. This suggests that Kriere could be alive but in a vulnerable situation, possibly stranded and needing rescue. Burnett also knows that Kriere is carefully protected, so if he's anywhere nearby, there's a good chance he has taken precautions to ensure his safety. Finding Lethla's body in their territory adds urgency to the situation, as it might trigger further conflict between Venus and Earth." />
    <node id="!&quot;&#10; &#10; Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell. What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone else.&#10; &#10; Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. &quot;Snap out of it, Sam. Think! Kriere—The All-Mighty—in our territory. His right hand man dead. That means Kriere was in an accident, too!&quot;&#10; &#10; Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.&#10;&quot;Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.&#10; &#10; &quot;As for Kriere—if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution is taken to protect that one.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But Lethla! His body must mean something!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And" />
    <node id="1. Lethla's presence on a morgue ship, the Constellation, was part of an elaborate plan to safely transport Venusian cargo, namely Kriere, to Venus. The Morgue Rocket provided a perfect cover for such a mission as no one would suspect it of carrying valuable cargo.&#10;&#10;2. Burnett survived living in the void by using his wits and taking advantage of Lethla's overconfidence. He lured Lethla into a false sense of security by pretending to follow Lethla's demands, all while covertly activating a robotic claw that crushed Kriere, thereby drawing Lethla's attention and creating an opportunity for Burnett and Rice to subdue him.&#10;&#10;The story does not explicitly explain how Burnett lived in the void or what the &quot;void&quot; refers to, but it can be inferred from context that surviving in space without proper equipment or protection would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, Burnett's survival in the &quot;void&quot; is likely due to his resourcefulness and the specific circumstances of the story rather than any general ability to live in space without assistance." />
    <node id=" crate?&quot; he asked Lethla easily.&#10; &#10; Lethla exhaled softly. &quot;Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Very,&quot; said Burnett.&#10; &#10; He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it would all be over.&#10; &#10; Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead, he squinted.&#10; &#10; &quot;There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good trick.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Cut power! We don't want to burn him!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen, eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.&#10; &#10; &quot;We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.&quot; Burnett turned to Lethla with an intent scowl.

    <node id="1. Sam is urgently called by Burnett because there is something suspicious about the body of an enemy official that they are transporting. It appears &quot;a little too dead,&quot; which arouses their suspicion.&#10;2. Burnett seems unbothered by the sight of a body with cooling blood because he has become desensitized to the sight of dead bodies after seeing so many during war. He has realized that he can never &quot;catch up&quot; with the war or its destruction, and all the excitement is always ahead of him in the form of rocket drives, bombings, and explosions." />
    <node id="Morgue Ship&#10; &#10;&#10; By RAY BRADBURY&#10; &#10; &#10; This was Burnett's last trip. Three more shelves to fill with space-slain warriors—and he would be among the living again.&#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1944.

Pallid and quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him; machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet, keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.&#10; &#10; Burnett didn't move.

    <node id="1. Opportunity to end the war: Burnett sees the potential for ending the long-lasting conflict between Venus and Earth by capturing Kriere, who is responsible for much of the war. This would also mean an end to &quot;blind searching&quot; and the many sleeping warriors ready to fight at a moment's notice.&#10;2. Personal safety: Helping Lethla might ensure his own safety and that of Rice. Lethla had hinted at the possibility of coming out alive if they cooperated.&#10;3. Sense of duty or loyalty: Burnett feels obligated to protect the war effort, as suggested by the stirring dead lips of warriors in his ears. He hesitates due to the presence of many warriors sleeping on numbered shelves in the dim corridors of the long years.&#10;4. Last trip and peace: Capturing Kriere could potentially end the war and bring about peace, which appeals to Burnett despite his initial reluctance and tiredness.&#10;5. Difficulty in capturing Kriere: Burnett is aware that Kriere is carefully protected, making the task of capturing him more challenging.&#10;&#10;Based on these factors, Burnett experiences an internal struggle between ensuring his safety and ending the war while also being mindful of the many sleeping warriors who could pose a threat if they woke up. His decision to cooperate with Lethla and capture Kriere is influenced by all these considerations but driven primarily by the opportunity to end the war and bring about peace.&#10;&#10;In terms of Burnett's survival in the &quot;void,&quot; it is not explicitly explained, but it can be inferred that he survived through resourcefulness and taking advantage of Lethla's overconfidence. He faked cooperation while secretly activating a robotic claw to crush Kriere, creating an opportunity for him and Rice to subdue Lethla." />
    <node id="1. The cargo of corpses that Sam Burnett has been hauling for three thousand nights and days represents the harsh reality of war and its destructive consequences. As a result, Burnett has become desensitized to the sight of dead bodies, realizing that he can never &quot;catch up&quot; with the war or its destruction. This constant exposure to death has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties.&#10;2. Burnett's perspective on patriotism is affected by his experiences in transporting the cargo of corpses because it shows him the true cost of war. He feels that he has done his part in keeping soldiers from further harm, but the weariness of his job and the lack of excitement have made him question the value of his work.&#10;3. On the other hand, Rice's viewpoint on patriotism is more immediate and excited. He looks forward to finishing their current mission and going on a ten-day drunk back on Earth, implying that he sees their work as a means to an end - the opportunity to enjoy life away from war.&#10;4. In summary, the cargo of corpses has taken a psychological toll on Burnett, making him question his role in the war and his feelings towards patriotism. Meanwhile, Rice maintains a more traditional viewpoint on patriotism as a duty to serve one's country, looking forward to the rewards that come with fulfilling that duty." />
    <node id="1. The unusual aspect of the enemy official's body that Burnett notices is that it appears &quot;a little too dead.&quot; This observation arouses his suspicion because it seems unnatural, given his extensive experience with handling dead bodies during the Venus-Earth conflict.&#10;2. He finds it suspicious because this level of stillness and lifelessness could indicate something out of the ordinary or potentially dangerous. Burnett's experience has taught him to be vigilant for any signs that may suggest a change in the status quo, especially when it comes to enemy officials. Therefore, he becomes alarmed and calls Sam to investigate further." />
    <node id="1. The soldier's confused and dying hallucination is conveyed through Burnett's perspective as he loses consciousness and experiences a series of numbers and names along with a sense of distance and detachment from his surroundings. This is indicated by the text describing Burnett's internal feelings of tension, and his voice sounding deep and not belonging to him anymore. Additionally, Rice's matter-of-fact voice comes over the radio, contributing to Burnett's dissociation from reality as he becomes more detached from the situation. The repetition of numbers, such as &quot;Number ninety-eight,&quot; further emphasizes this detachment and adds to the surreal quality of Burnett's hallucination." />
    <node id="1. Sam is urgently called by Burnett because there is something suspicious about the body of an enemy official (Lethla) that they are transporting. It appears &quot;a little too dead,&quot; which arouses their suspicion.&#10;2. Burnett seems unbothered by the sight of a body with cooling blood because he has become desensitized to the sight of dead bodies after seeing so many during war. He has realized that he can never &quot;catch up&quot; with the war or its destruction, and all the excitement is always ahead of him in the form of rocket drives, bombings, and explosions.&#10;&#10;The urgency in Burnett's call to Sam stems from the unusual observation that Lethla's body appears &quot;a little too dead.&quot; This discovery makes them suspect that something out of the ordinary or potentially dangerous might have happened. Given Burnett's experience with handling dead bodies during the Venus-Earth conflict, he understands the importance of staying vigilant for any signs indicating a change in the status quo, particularly when dealing with enemy officials. Therefore, he becomes alarmed and calls Sam to investigate further.&#10;&#10;As for why Burnett seems unbothered by the sight of another dead body, it's due to his extensive exposure to death during the war. He has become desensitized to the sight of dead bodies after witnessing so many throughout the conflict. Additionally, he believes that nothing significant can be gained from dwelling on the past as there is always more excitement and destruction ahead in the form of battles, explosions, and pursuits." />
    <node id="1. Lethla's presence on the morgue ship, the Constellation, was part of an elaborate plan to safely transport Venusian cargo, namely Kriere, to Venus. The Morgue Rocket provided a perfect cover for such a mission as no one would suspect it of carrying valuable cargo.&#10;2. Burnett's survival in the &quot;void&quot; (which refers to space) is not explicitly explained in the story, but it can be inferred that he survived through his resourcefulness and the specific circumstances of the story. It is considered impossible to survive in space without proper equipment or protection." />
    <node id="Based on Sam Burnett's experience in the Venus-Earth conflict and his recent encounter with Lethla, it can be inferred that Kriere might be in a vulnerable situation, possibly stranded and needing rescue. The fact that Lethla died in Venusian territory, with Kriere's body nearby, suggests that they may have been involved in an accident. This discovery also adds urgency to the situation as it could trigger further conflict between Venus and Earth. Burnett knows that Kriere is carefully protected, so if he's anywhere nearby, there's a good chance he has taken precautions to ensure his safety. Therefore, finding Lethla's body in their territory indicates that Kriere might be in danger and in need of help." />
    <node id="1. Captain Burnett's plan to prevent Kriere from attacking him involves yanking Lethla off guard, shocking or bewildering him in some way to create an opportunity for capturing Krieve. However, the exact details of his plan are not provided.&#10;2. Lethla's location is on board the Constellation, which serves as a morgue rocket and provides cover for transporting Venusian cargo, namely Kriere, safely to Venus." />
    <node id="1. Lethla, a Venusian, boards the morgue ship Constellation to find and capture Kriere, who is being protected by Rice and Burnett.&#10;2. Lethla is able to survive in the void of space using a special glassite mask that he wears like a helmet, which provides him with oxygen and goes unnoticed due to its thinness and transparency.&#10;3. Upon entering the Constellation, Lethla reveals his true identity as Kriere's majordomo to Rice and Burnett.&#10;4. In order to draw Lethla off guard and create an opportunity to subdue him, Burnett tricks him by activating a robotic claw that crushes Kriere, who was hidden on the ship.&#10;5. This distraction allows Burnett and Rice to attack Lethla, who is disarmed and beaten in the ensuing fight." />

He swore at the Venusian and the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and quick.&#10; &#10; Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. &quot;First time in years a man ever came aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. &quot;I thought it might be. Where's your radio?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Go find it!&quot; snapped Rice, hotly.&#10; &#10; &quot;I will.&quot; One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.&#10;&quot;I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock is safe. Don't move.&quot; Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and coils. The radio.&#10; &#10; Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by the new bitterness in it.&#10; &#10; Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.&#10; &#10; He" />

In the silence he reached up with quick fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.&#10; &#10; He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. &quot;That's how I did it, Earthman.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Glassite!&quot; said Rice. &quot;A face-moulded mask of glassite!&quot;&#10; &#10; Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. &quot;Very marvelously pared to an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible at all.&quot;&#10; &#10; Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face.

    <node id="1. First, Burnett should capture Lethla and secure him in a safe location on the Constellation. This can be done by using restraints or placing him in a holding cell.&#10;2. Next, Burnett should confirm that Krieve is indeed alive but in need of rescue. If Krieve is injured or otherwise unable to move, Burnett may need to provide medical assistance before proceeding.&#10;3. Once Krieve is confirmed to be alive and able to travel, Burnett can place him on one of the empty shelves on the Constellation. This will ensure that Kriere is safely transported to Venus while also providing cover for the Venusian cargo.&#10;4. To help Krieve escape safely to Venus, Burnett should make sure that the Constellation is equipped with the necessary supplies and equipment for the journey. This may include food, water, medical supplies, and any other items that Kriere may need during the trip.&#10;5. Finally, Burnett must obtain one more body for cargo. Since Lethla's body is already on board the Constellation, Burnett can use it as part of the cargo. Alternatively, Burnett may need to locate another Venusian who has recently died or is close to death in order to complete the cargo.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the story does not explicitly state that Burnett needs to help Krieve escape safely to Venus, but based on the context of the Venus-Earth conflict and Burnett's previous actions to prevent further conflict, it can be inferred that helping Krieve reach a safe location would be in line with his goals." />
    <node id="Based on the story and the supporting materials, Captain Burnett is preparing for an anticipated attack from Lethla and Kriere as he takes control of the star-port, with Rice operating the controls, during their &quot;last trip&quot; to end the war. Burnett's plan is to capture Kriere, which would mean the end of the war, the end of storing soldiers in morgue rockets, and the cessation of blind searching for enemies.&#10;&#10;Cooperating with Lethla could ensure Burnett's safety and that of Rice, as well as complete &quot;the last trip.&quot; Although Burnett initially hesitates, he sees this as an opportunity to end the conflict and prevent further casualties. To achieve his goal, Burnett is getting ready for a potential attack from both Lethla and Kriere while ensuring safe transportation for them, planning to turn the situation around in order to capture Kriere and put an end to the war." />
    <node id="Captain Sam Burnett's thoughts and actions aim to prevent any further conflict between Venus and Earth, protect the valuable cargo (Krieve) being transported to Venus, and ensure his own survival. His experience in the Venus-Earth conflict tells him that Kriere might be in a vulnerable situation after finding Lethla dead in their territory. Burnett deduces that helping Krieve could potentially avert further conflict between the two factions, as attacking Krieve now would likely escalate tensions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, knowing that Kriere is carefully protected and aware of the precautions he might have taken to ensure his safety, Burnett sees an opportunity to capture him when Lethla's body is found in their territory. By planning to yank Lethla off guard, Burnett hopes to stun or bewilder him, creating a chance to subdue Krieve.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, by contemplating the safe transportation of Venusian cargo (Kriere) on board the morgue ship Constellation, Burnett demonstrates his concern for the well-being and safety of the valuable cargo. He understands that the Morgue Rocket provides excellent cover for such a mission due to its nature as a morgue ship, which would not raise suspicions about carrying valuable cargo like Krieve.&#10;&#10;In summary, Burnett's thoughts and actions revolve around preventing further conflict between Venus and Earth, protecting the valuable cargo (Krieve), and securing an opportunity to capture Krieve by exploiting Lethla's reaction to finding his dead body." />
    <node id="Based on the story and supporting materials, Captain Burnett's desperate measure to neutralize Lethla involves tricking him into thinking that Krieve has been accidentally crushed by a robotic claw. This distraction allows Burnett and Rice to attack Lethla, who is then disarmed and beaten in the ensuing fight. By doing so, Burnett creates an opportunity to capture Kriere and end the war, despite the initial odds being against them with Krieve aboard." />
    <node id="1. The speakers, Lethla and Kriere, used a morgue ship, the Constellation, and tricked the Purple Cross to safely travel to Venus because their flag ship was attacked and destroyed near Mars, leaving them without fuel, food, water, or a functional radio. They were certain to be captured if they remained in the life-rocket, so they set a small time-bomb to destroy it and cast off wearing chrysali-helmets, which are not easily discernible as carrying living occupants. The Morgue Rocket provided an excellent cover for their escape, as no one would suspect it of carrying valuable Venusian cargo or living beings. They knew the Purple Cross morgue ship picked up all bodies for brief exams and returned alien corpses to space later, providing them with a chance to take control of the ship and reach Venus safely." />
    <node id=" more hours. Our flag ship was attacked unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the Earth cordon unseen.

We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rice's voice was sullen. &quot;A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe to Venus.&quot;&#10; &#10; Lethla bowed slightly. &quot;Who would suspect a Morgue" />
    <node id="As Sam Burnett prepares to board the Ruler's ship, the situation on the Constellation involves having Lethla, Kriere's right-hand man, onboard. His body appears &quot;a little too dead&quot; to both Burnett and Rice, which arouses their suspicion. Burnett finds this unusual observation alarming due to his extensive experience in handling dead bodies during the Venus-Earth conflict. He believes that this level of stillness could indicate something out of the ordinary or potentially dangerous.&#10;&#10;Burnett's thoughts revolve around capturing Lethla and securing him safely on the Constellation while ensuring Krieve is alive but in need of rescue. He plans to place Kriere on one of the empty shelves on the ship, providing cover for the Venusian cargo. Burnett also makes sure that the Constellation is equipped with necessary supplies and equipment for the journey to Venus.&#10;&#10;In addition, Burnett intends to help Krieve escape safely to Venus, preventing further conflict between Venus and Earth. He hasn't explicitly shared his plan to capture Kriere, but it seems he plans to yank Lethla off guard, creating an opportunity for capturing Krieve. With Lethla's body on board the Constellation, Burnett will either use it as part of the cargo or find another Venusian who has recently died or is close to death to complete the required cargo." />
    <node id="Captain Burnett is preparing to neutralize the threat of both Lethla and Kriere, who are anticipated to attack him at the star-port. He plans to do this by tricking Lethla into thinking that Kriere has been accidentally crushed by a robotic claw, creating a distraction that allows Burnett and Rice to disarm and defeat Lethla. This opportunity enables Burnett to capture Kriere, which would mean an end to the war, the end of storing soldiers in morgue rockets, and the cessation of blind searching for enemies.&#10;&#10;Burnett's expectation is that capturing Kriere will put an end to the Venus-Earth conflict, as Kriere has been a significant contributor to the war efforts. By cooperating with Lethla and turning the situation around, Burnett aims to ensure his safety and Rice's, complete &quot;the last trip,&quot; and bring about peace. However, he is aware that capturing Kriere will be challenging, as Kriere is carefully protected and may have taken precautions for his safety." />
    <node id="1. The speakers, Lethla and Kriere, disguised themselves as dead bodies and took over a morgue ship (the Constellation) in order to safely travel to Venus because their flagship was attacked and destroyed near Mars, leaving them without fuel, food, water, or a functional radio. They were certain to be captured if they remained in the life-rocket, so they set a small time-bomb to destroy it and cast off wearing chrysali-helmets, which are not easily discernible as carrying living occupants.

    <node id="1. The white spider refers to the appearance of Lethla's spaceship, which resembles a white spider looming larger on a web of stars. This visual metaphor emphasizes Lethla's cold and quiet demeanor, giving readers an impression of his character even before his actions or words are revealed.&#10;2. Sam Burnett uses the long claw-like mechanism to give the illusion of rescuing Kriere, while in reality, he is tricking Lethla into thinking that Krieve has been accidentally crushed. This action creates a distraction and allows Burnett and Rice to attack Lethla, ultimately disarming and beating him in the ensuing fight.&#10;3. By capturing Kriere, Burnett aims to end the war between Venus and Earth, as Kriere has been responsible for much of the conflict over the past ten years. This move would also signify the end of &quot;blind searching&quot; and the numerous sleeping warriors on the shelves. Furthermore, helping Lethla might ensure Burnett's own safety and that of Rice.&#10;4. Thus, using the long claw-like mechanism to trick Lethla into believing Krieve has been accidentally crushed marks an essential turning point in ending the war between Venus and Earth. This action highlights Burnett's cunning tactics and determination to bring about peace despite the initial odds being against them with Krieve aboard." />
    <node id="1. In the story, there is no indication that Burnett and Lethla discuss Krieve appearing dead and floating in space. The text states that Lethla boards the Constellation to find and capture Kriere, who is being protected by Burnett and Rice. However, it does not mention any discussion about Krieve being dead or floating in space.&#10;2. The statement &quot;and why is this the first and last time anyone will board the Constellation alive?&quot; is also not supported by the story. There is no information provided about the fates of other individuals who may have previously boarded the Constellation, so it cannot be concluded that Lethla is the first or last person to board the ship alive.&#10;3. Based on the information provided in the story and supporting materials, Burnett's plan to prevent Kriere from attacking him involves yanking Lethla off guard by tricking him into thinking that Krieve has been accidentally crushed by a robotic claw. This distraction allows Burnett and Rice to attack Lethla, who is then disarmed and beaten in the ensuing fight. The story does not mention anything about Krieve appearing dead or floating in space, nor does it provide any information about the Constellation being the first or last ship that anyone will board alive." />
    <node id="1. Captain Burnett's concern about not having a full cargo on their rocket, the Constellation, is rooted in his sense of duty and responsibility towards the children whose loved ones have lost their lives in space. The Constellation serves as a morgue rocket that retrieves these bodies, providing a valuable service that allows the families to &quot;sleep easy on the good green earth&quot; knowing their loved ones will receive a proper burial. Burnett believes it would be wrong for them to return to Center Base without fulfilling this mission, as it could let down both the families and the long history of the Constellation's mission.&#10;2. Captain Burnett feels it is important to bring back kids (the bodies of those who have died) from Center Base despite the dangers because he believes in upholding the tradition and responsibility of the Constellation's mission. Over three thousand days, they have never returned without a full cargo, providing closure for the families of the deceased. Burnett understands that these missions can be dangerous but considers it crucial to maintain this tradition and ensure that those who have lost their lives in space are brought back for proper burials." />
    <node id="1. The red haze that Sam Burnett sees as he prepares to receive a dead body on the Constellation is symbolic of the brutal and violent nature of war. It represents the bloodshed and destruction that has become all too familiar to Burnett, who has been transporting bodies for three thousand days and nights.&#10;2. The red haze does not seem to have a direct impact on Burnett's ability to perform his duties. However, it is a stark reminder of the psychological toll that his work has taken on him. It highlights the emotional burden that he carries as he goes about his grim task of transporting the bodies of those who have lost their lives in space.&#10;3. In this context, the red haze can be seen as a visual metaphor for Burnett's desensitization to violence and death. The constant exposure to dead bodies has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties. It also reflects the psychological impact of war on soldiers who are exposed to prolonged periods of violence and destruction.&#10;4. Therefore, the red haze serves as a reminder of the true cost of war, both in terms of human lives lost and the emotional toll it takes on those left behind. It is a powerful symbol that encapsulates Burnett's feelings of weariness and disillusionment with his role in the conflict." />

He plans to place Kriere on one of the empty shelves on the ship, providing cover for the Venusian cargo. Burnett also makes sure that the Constellation is equipped with necessary supplies and equipment for the journey to Venus.&#10;&#10;In addition, Burnett intends to help Krieve escape safely to Venus, preventing further conflict between Venus and Earth. He hasn't explicitly shared his plan to capture Kriere, but it seems he plans to yank Lethla off guard, creating an opportunity for capturing Krieve. With Lethla's body on board the Constellation, Burnett will either use it as part of the cargo or find another Venusian who has recently died or is close to death to complete the required cargo.">

The red haze that Sam Burnett sees as he prepares to receive a dead body on the Constellation is symbolic of the brutal and violent nature of war. It represents the bloodshed and destruction that has become all too familiar to Burnett, who has been transporting bodies for three thousand days and nights.&#10;2. The red haze does not seem to have a direct impact on Burnett's ability to perform his duties. However, it is a stark reminder of the psychological toll that his work has taken on him. It highlights the emotional burden that he carries as he goes about his grim task of transporting the bodies of those who have lost their lives in space.&#10;3. In this context, the red haze can be seen as a visual metaphor for Burnett's desensitization to violence and death. The constant exposure to dead bodies has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties. It also reflects the psychological impact of war on soldiers who are exposed to prolonged periods of violence and destruction.&#10;4. Therefore, the red haze serves as a reminder of the true cost of war, both in terms of human lives lost and the emotional toll it takes on those left behind. It is a powerful symbol that encapsulates Burnett's feelings of weariness and disillusionment with his role in the conflict.">

This constant exposure to death has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties.&#10;2. Burnett's perspective on patriotism is affected by his experiences in transporting the cargo of corpses because it shows him the true cost of war.

As a result, Burnett has become desensitized to the sight of dead bodies, realizing that he can never &quot;catch up&quot; with the war or its destruction. This constant exposure to death has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties.&#10;2. Burnett's perspective on patriotism is affected by his experiences in transporting the cargo of corpses because it shows him the true cost of war. He feels that he has done his part in keeping soldiers from further harm, but the weariness of his job and the lack of excitement have made him question the value of his work.&#10;3. On the other hand, Rice's viewpoint on patriotism is more immediate and excited. He looks forward to finishing their current mission and going on a ten-day drunk back on Earth, implying that he sees their work as a means to an end - the opportunity to enjoy life away from war.&#10;4. In summary, the cargo of corpses has taken a psychological toll on Burnett, making him question his role in the war and his feelings towards patriotism. Meanwhile, Rice maintains a more traditional viewpoint on patriotism as a duty to serve one's country, looking forward to the rewards that come with fulfilling that duty.">

The red haze that Sam Burnett sees as he prepares to receive a dead body on the Constellation is symbolic of the brutal and violent nature of war. It represents the bloodshed and destruction that has become all too familiar to Burnett, who has been transporting bodies for three thousand days and nights.&#10;2. The red haze does not seem to have a direct impact on Burnett's ability to perform his duties. However, it is a stark reminder of the psychological toll that his work has taken on him. It highlights the emotional burden that he carries as he goes about his grim task of transporting the bodies of those who have lost their lives in space.&#10;3. In this context, the red haze can be seen as a visual metaphor for Burnett's desensitization to violence and death. The constant exposure to dead bodies has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties. It also reflects the psychological impact of war on soldiers who are exposed to prolonged periods of violence and destruction.&#10;4. Therefore, the red haze serves as a reminder of the true cost of war, both in terms of human lives lost and the emotional toll it takes on those left behind. It is a powerful symbol that encapsulates Burnett's feelings of weariness and disillusionment with his role in the conflict.">

The red haze that Sam Burnett sees as he prepares to receive a dead body on the Constellation is symbolic of the brutal and violent nature of war. It represents the bloodshed and destruction that has become all too familiar to Burnett, who has been transporting bodies for three thousand days and nights.&#10;2. The red haze does not seem to have a direct impact on Burnett's ability to perform his duties. However, it is a stark reminder of the psychological toll that his work has taken on him. It highlights the emotional burden that he carries as he goes about his grim task of transporting the bodies of those who have lost their lives in space.&#10;3. In this context, the red haze can be seen as a visual metaphor for Burnett's desensitization to violence and death. The constant exposure to dead bodies has made him weary and longing for an end to his duties. It also reflects the psychological impact of war on soldiers who are exposed to prolonged periods of violence and destruction.&#10;4. Therefore, the red haze serves as a reminder of the true cost of war, both in terms of human lives lost and the emotional toll it takes on those left behind. It is a powerful symbol that encapsulates Burnett's feelings of weariness and disillusionment with his role in the conflict.">
